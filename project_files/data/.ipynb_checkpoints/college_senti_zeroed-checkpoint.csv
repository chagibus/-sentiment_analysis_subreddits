20,1595636765.0,college,"An Honest Letter from Your University President About Why We're Opening This FallDear faculty,

Oh, and staff. Sorry, we keep forgetting you exist. So sorry. You're like the middle child of higher education. You've been so quiet since you realized that unlike faculty we'll actually fire you for speaking up.

Many of you have expressed concern with our plans to move ahead with in-person classes this fall. I personally find the plan to be relatively simple.

All we need to do to safely and successfully reopen is require everyone to wear a mask at all times, test all students, faculty and staff for COVID-  before fall semester starts, require all students to self-isolate for   days before they arrive, split most of our classes into two groups that will never meet together in-person, remove half the furniture from all of our classrooms and public spaces, dedicate entire ~~dorms~~ residence halls to housing sick students, train faculty to live stream their classes to remote students while juggling the virtual and in-person management of questions and feedback, assume students will maintain physical distance and wear masks when they're off campus, assume students won't go to any parties, prep faculty to move to remote instruction immediately if they get sick or have to self-quarantine, require faculty to designate a ""colleague on call"" to serve as their academic next of kin who'll teach their class for no additional pay if they get sick or die, rearrange foot traffic patterns in all of our buildings and stairwells, dramatically increase cleaning responsibilities for our overstretched environmental services team, completely change how we distribute food in dining halls, set the HVAC to blow as hard as possible in every building to keep air flow moving, hope our toxic work culture doesn't lead to people coming in sick despite us not updating our sick or leave policies to accommodate for a generational pandemic, and cross our fingers that we get to the point in the semester where we don't have to give refunds for housing or dining plans when we move to all online instruction anyway.

I don't see what's so complicated.

But since you all keep *insisting* on asking why we're taking such a ""risk"" in the midst of an unprecedented global pandemic in a country with a negligent federal response and a bunch of morons who think this is all a hoax and that mask wearing is how Bill "" G"" Gates will steal their rights or whatever, I'm writing to clarify the university's motivations for fall.

**Money.**

Oh my god *we're so boned* if we don't get more money.

Do you not realize how much of our funding is based on dramatically overpriced housing and food? Do you not know what an auxiliary service is? *Have you not noticed a bottle of Diet Coke is $ .  in the cafeteria?* Do you not come to the budget meetings we schedule once a year at  : pm the Friday before a holiday weekend?

Our endowment is like your savings account: Woefully inadequate and incapable of saving you. If we lose that sweet, sweet housing and food money we are going to have to fire at least a third of you to keep our own jobs safe, but at least we'll have a good reason to ditch those of you with tenure we don't like because you criticized us once three years ago. I'm coming for you, *Christina*.

So buck up, cupcake. Be resilient. Double your workload so you can help us maintain the façade that opening for in-person instruction is somehow going to be safe until we hit the tuition and housing due date.

We *need you* to do all this extra work so we can get that sweet, sweet student money and stay afloat. *You* are how we are going to get through this. ~~We're going to squeeze you dry and then ask for more (NOTE: Let's remove this line before we hit send).~~ By the way, here's a website about self-care that has three broken links to in-person yoga classes from last year.

This *will* involve you spending the summer designing your course twice for both in-person and online instruction. Extra funding? Hahahahahaha Nah, but here's a webcam and the login page for Zoom. Make it work.

To answer another question you've been pestering us with: Yes, we *have* noticed all the local K  school districts are going to be starting the school year online. As such, I've directed HR to do absolutely nothing to accommodate those of you who have been audacious enough to procreate. Figure it out. We can always replace you with a grad student or post doc who's desperate enough to barely scrape by. Your call.

What? No, no we definitely won't be paying you more for the extra work you're doing.

Yes, this is probably your new normal workload moving forward if you're lucky enough to survive the Hunger Games machinations our CFO will be doing this fall.

No, we won't guarantee you won't be furloughed or fired anyway in two months.

Yes, this will put the Black and Latinx members of our community at risk since they're disproportionately represented on our environmental services staff. Unrelated note: Did I mention we're changing the name of that building that's been named after a white supremacist the past   years? I, for one, am grateful to be a part of solving racism forever.

Where was I again? Oh yes, money.

We need money to under pay you, the staff, and the adjuncts who teach  % of our courses. So take this mask we paid too much to put our logo on and get to work. At least until the tuition refund deadline passes.

Love,

Your University President

And then a week after that, I posted an update:

>**I had a ton of people telling me to make him a sandwich back, so I decided to do it! When our lecture ended today, I walked up to him and told him that I made him a sandwich. When I handed it to him, he had a huge smile on his face and said, ""Wow thanks! I appreciate that"". We then ended up chatting for a bit and exchanged instas.**

So here's the final update - A lot of redditors were telling me to message him on insta first and to ask him to study for finals with me. So I listened to everyone and messaged him last week! He agreed to it and we ended up studying together and getting to know each other. We took our final exam last thursday, and after that he asked if I wanted to have dinner with him to celebrate the last day of school. I told him that I couldn't because I had car racing practice that night. So he then asked me if he can watch me practice, and I said yeah.

So that night, he watched me drive lap after lap. Then after my practice when my coach left, sandwich guy asked me if he can try out my car. Typically, you need a racing license to drive a formula vee at my local track, but I wanted him to like me so I let him ride it. I taught him how to drive it and he loved it. It was so much fun!

We had a   multiple choice question quiz once a week in place of tests that were based on short readings from various webpages that he would give us. I was sitting at a high B and really wanted an A in the class. 

The week before the final he told us that the test would be based on the readings he gave us, and based on how short they were and the fact that I have had other bad professors do the same thing, I assumed he was just going to reuse quiz questions on the final. Rather than studying normally I dug through my old quizzes and made a document with every question and correct answer. Over the course of a few evenings I studied the paper as much as I could and got to the point where I had memorized the answer to all   questions.

Last Friday I showed up to take my exam, I sat down in my desk with nothing but a pencil and was ready to take my test. When he handed me my exam I was absolutely stoked to see that the first question was the first question from quiz  . I answered it quickly and started to scan the page and realized that the final was every quiz question (with some removed to make the test   questions) in chronological order.

It took me about   minutes to finish the exam, and in hindsight I realize I probably should have sat around for a while but I was hungry and wanted to leave so I went to his desk, turned in my test, was told I would get my grade on Monday at  am and left.

Fast forward to today and instead of getting a grade I got an email asking for me to come to my professor's office.

He then told me that he made a request to be sent security camera footage from the exam and that he would be looking over it later today and asked if I had anything to say.

I told him that I assumed he was going to reuse questions on the final and that I just studied old quizzes and he seemed to get a little frustrated, and told me that using test banks can be considered academic dishonesty and that he may have to elevate this further.

So, to all the people who have majors that correlate to well-paying, specific entry-level jobs post-college and constantly berate others for trying to live THEIR lives, pay close attention.

 . Not everyone wants to do what you do. Do you ever think about that? We don't all want to be software engineers or nurses or business analysts etc. People have different interests and enjoy having the freedom to pursue those interests. If people want to study anthro, let them do it. If they want to study music, let them! Don't be an asshole. You would be surprised by all of the opportunities you don't know exist that people in the ""useless"" majors have that you could never dream of.
 . Not everyone has the aptitude for it. Yeah, I'm tired of hearing people tell others ""wHY diDN't yoU JuST do ENGinEEriNG?"" as if they know the person they are telling this to better than they know themselves. Stuff like that requires a higher level of understanding of math and science that not everyone can ""just do."" Just because it's easy for you or you are driven to succeed in it doesn't mean everyone else can. Forcing people into engineering or comp sci (for example) when they aren't good at math or coding only for them to get a  .  GPA and learn nothing and not get any internships because of their horrendous academic performance isn't going to do anyone any good.
 . Going off of the last point, just because someone isn't cut out for a certain major doesn't make them stupid. We are all different and we are all naturally good at different things. For example, I hate public speaking and being in front of people. I would be an awful performing arts/theatre major. Does that make me stupid? Of course not. I am not a big fan of working with kids all day. I know for a fact I would not be able to handle majoring in elementary education. Does not being able to handle the elementary ed curriculum make me a failure? No, it doesn't. Everyone has their own limitations and it's nothing to be ashamed of. I would like you to consider how well you would do if you were suddenly placed in a major like that.
 . Just because you think your major is ""hard"" that doesn't automatically mean everyone else's majors are ""easy."" I get it, especially as a science major myself. We tend to think that we are on more difficult path because of the coursework. However, that doesn't mean ours is harder, it just means it's hard in a different way. For instance, philosophy majors have to become really good at critical thought, which is an excellent skill to have and something most of us are severely lacking. Education majors have to become very knowledgeable in a subject area and be able to teach it to kids/teens/etc, which is something I think would be incredibly difficult. Classics majors, depending on the school, develop a high level of understanding of Greek and Latin and learn to write well in these languages, which is an amazing ability because writing in English is already hard enough. I encourage you all to check out the curriculums of these so-called ""easy"" majors.
 . Not everyone is motivated by money. Yes, money is good, I agree. However, there are people out there that want to pursue something they are passionate about and couldn't care less how much it paid. It is far better to study something you want to study and take a lower paying job and being happy with it than it is to study something just because ""it's going to get me money"" and then be miserable for the next   years of your life.
 . You don't have to go into the field that you majored in. I know this is gonna be a hard pill for all you specific entry level job majors to swallow, but it's true. You can take the skills you learned in any major and apply them broadly. If you know how to market yourself and you take advantage of the opportunities that are presented to you or the one's that you seek out, then you will be fine. Do you honestly think people don't have a plan? Yes, I am sure some don't, but the majority do have some sort of direction they are looking towards going and they have a college degree to help them out.

In conclusion, stop judging people for choosing what THEY want to do with THEIR college experience. All majors are respectable and offer something unique to the world. No major is useless and no major is easy and some people want more out of life than money.

This is like getting socks. But hey, I know a lot of you need socks, so it's not that bad.

Common problem I'm sure a lot of you are facing is how to reach essay minimum page requirements. I'm here to help. This is only really looking at one specific technique, there's lots of others, and maybe I'll do write ups on them also. The key here though is that this *isn't* about just padding your essay. It's about reaching the minimum length *by doing what you're actually expected to do.* It's like cheating on a test by smuggling notes in your brain.

Let's take a hypothetical essay discussing polarizing foods. Here's a stereotypically bad bit of (hypothetical) student writing:

>One food that causes a lot of debate is pineapple on pizza. In Haidt's article he finds that  % of people hate pineapple on pizza. This clearly shows pineapple is one of the most controversial foods on pizza.

Shit. We just covered pineapple in like   lines of text. That was going to be the centerpiece of the essay!

To improve on this, always look for more clarity, depth, and specificity. We'll start with the first sentence. ...Is there evidence of this debate we can point to?

>One food that causes a lot of debate is pineapple on pizza. For instance, a Reddit post ranked pineapple on pizza as the most controversial food.

Good start, but what lots of details are missing.

>For instance, a Reddit post on the popular r/askreddit forum asked community members what food they found to be the most controversial and pineapple was the clear winner.

Better, but we're using an internet sources a lot of folks aren't familiar with. Is it credible? More detail helps:

>For instance, a Reddit post on the popular r/askreddit forum asked community members what food they found to be the most controversial. The post received a net  ,  upvotes and  ,  comments. The highest voted comment was for pineapple on pizza. But, pineapple on pizza wasn't just the top response; it also ranked  th,  th, and  th.

Our first sentence has now become longer than the entire original paragraph just be expanding on the ""causes a lot of debate"" idea. Now let's move on to ""In Haidt's article he finds that  % of people hate pineapple on pizza.""

First we need to tell the audience who this guy is.

>Jonathan Haidt is an ethics professor at the NYU Stern School of Business and has written extensively on the subject of disgust.

After that, we should give more detail about just what the study found (I'm making up the study, btw, but Haidt does study disgust). We should provide more detail about the specific research results, and can add a bit of narrative about the research methods as well.

>In a study of   college students in New York City, Haidt found that on a scale of   to   where   is ""strongly dislike"" and   is ""strongly like,""  % of respondents ranked pineapple on pizza at  , while  % ranked it at  . Only  % put it in the middle with a rank of  .

In the original,  % disliking it didn't actually tell us it was controversial, it told us only a lot of people hate it -- but we need to know how many like it as well, and the number of ambivalent people is another useful detail. We can go into more depth with some added context drawn from other questions in the study:

>While pineapple had  % of all respondents answering   or  , sausage only had  % in either category, with only  % saying they strongly dislike it.

Good, that tells us how it compares to an uncontroversial topping. How does it rate among other controversial toppings though?

>Compared to other controversial toppings, pineapple is still very polarizing. For instance, olives only had  % ranking it   or  , bell peppers had  %, and mushrooms were at  %. The only thing with more results at the extremes was anchovies with  % having a strong opinion, though  % ranked it at  , showing it isn't controversial, just universally disliked.

Holy cow, now we've got ourselves a real life college essay paragraph. Let's put the pieces together and see how she looks:

>One food that causes a lot of debate is pineapple on pizza. For instance, a Reddit post on the popular r/askreddit forum asked community members what food they found to be the most controversial. The post received a net  ,  upvotes and  ,  comments. The highest voted comment was for pineapple on pizza. But, pineapple on pizza wasn't just the top response; it also ranked  th,  th, and  th. Jonathan Haidt is an ethics professor at the NYU Stern School of Business and has written extensively on the subject of disgust. In a study of   college students in New York City, Haidt found that on a scale of   to   where   is ""strongly dislike"" and   is ""strongly like,""  % of respondents ranked pineapple on pizza at  , while  % ranked it at  . Only  % put it in the middle with a rank of  . While pineapple had  % of all respondents answering   or  , sausage only had  % in either category, with only  % saying they strongly dislike it. Compared to other controversial toppings, pineapple is still very polarizing. For instance, olives only had  % ranking it   or  , bell peppers had  %, and mushrooms were at  %. The only thing with more results at the extremes was anchovies with  % having a strong opinion, though  % ranked it at  , showing it isn't controversial, just universally disliked.

That's more than half a page (TNR  , double spaced).

Now what about the last line from the original? ""This clearly shows pineapple is one of the most controversial foods on pizza.""

Cut it. Don't need it. If I clearly showed you something, I don't need to tell you that I clearly showed you it. You know.

But wait, we're not done! We can get even more mileage out of this by commenting on the limitations of the study:

>It should be noted that the study was only of college students in New York City, and there may be a regional preference.

Again, we can expand this with greater levels of detail and specificity.

>It should be noted that the study was only of college students in New York City, and regional preferences may have influenced the results. Food preferences and traditions are known to vary from one region to the next, and pizza in particular has regional variations such as the Chicago deep dish. It may be that in some places were pineapple is more popular, pineapple on pizza is less of a contentious issue.

And, if you need to squeeze a little more mileage out of it, add a bit of your research narrative:

>However, in researching this topic, I was not able to find a study that compared regional attitudes towards pineapple on pizza.

That's all there is to it.

...One huge caveat of course. Expanding your writing in this way first requires that you have a clue what the heck you're talking about. You need to have done the research, have actual good sources, and understand the sources and your subject to be able to discuss it in a nuanced manner.

He talked about how drugged and controlling she was all   days of class, and called her a whore. Every word that came out of his mouth was ignorant and superficial. All  ish of us huffed and puffed at everything he said. He barely even discussed what we’re supposed to be learning or doing in the course, all we did was cruddy introductions, and then on wednesday, he decided it was hilarious to introduce his next talking point by loudly banging on this metal cowbell with a kitchen mallet, incessantly for over   minutes!!!
I received an email about an hour ago that the instructor has been let go, and we will have our course reassigned in the next   hours.

LET’S FUCKING GOOOO!!

Original Post:

I didn’t even know that this was humanly possible, but I did it. Somehow. 

I had this paper that was assigned in MARCH and my professor repeatedly told us all over and over again throughout the semester, “please do not wait until the last minute to write this paper. I promise you will regret it. Please please start it early and do a little bit each day.”

Well what did my dumbass do? I started the paper   hours before it was due. I have never regretted a decision so much in my entire life. I’ve always said that I have no regrets, but for the first time in my life, I have a regret.

I was crying the whole time while writing this paper and felt intense anxiety the entire   hours but I did it. I somehow fucking did it. I genuinely did not think I would pull it off but somehow I submitted all   pages at  :  PM, just minutes before the deadline.

Now granted, they were   pages of pure dogshit and I’m probably gonna get a horrible grade but hey, given the circumstances I’m proud I at least finished it and powered through.

If y’all want an update once I find out my grade, let me know.

EDIT: A lot of you have been asking what the paper was so I’ll go ahead and explain. It wasn’t a research paper luckily so no sources needed or anything like that. It was for my marketing class and throughout the entire class we did a marketing simulation project where we had to run a business and marketing campaign selling products and it was divided into quarters. So the paper was basically explaining every single business decision you made in the simulation for each quarter and WHY you made that decision and what the result of each decision was and reflecting on the results so mentioning what you would have done differently, etc. Sounds like it wouldn’t take too long or be too difficult but you’d be surprised lol because overall there were A LOT of decisions made during the simulation and you had to go in depth on every one of them.",2336,435,0

It can be any course as long as it’s in the certain subject, so I found a freshman level course being offered online by a local community college to take.  I’m only   weeks in and I have a new empathy for my students.

As a student, I am incredibly anxious and perfectionist.  I have two bachelors and a masters degree, both of which I received with honors.  I’m a life long learner and quite honestly very interested in the subject matter of the class and have a good background in it, so I’m not sure if I am humbled or annoyed by my first test grade.

I very honestly studied.  The professor puts up power points to read and question guides to answer along with the power points.  I read EVERYTHING she posted, and I mean everything.  There were fyi handouts and videos that I read and viewed.  I filled in the review sheets.  I went back and reviewed the sheets and power points before the test.  I printed out the power points so I could have them as reference during the test as allowed.

So I kinda feel, if you have a student who is also a teacher, with a master degree, taking your freshman level course who can only get a  ….either something is wrong with the testing material or the teaching material.  Most of the questions I felt I knew with confidence but there were several that I felt were either super wordy to be confusing on purpose or I could have made a case for multiple correct answers.  I feel like I can clearly explain the material and the conclusions the professor is asking us to draw, but that is clearly not reflected in the grade.  I can not possibly imagine how a student right out of high school or brand new to college would have done well on that test.  I feel like they would be crying at the computer at the overload of information they were being asked to synthesize.

I know that not everyone gets A’s in everything.  Again, maybe just my ego is a bit bruised and I’m eating a slice of humble pie because I thought taking a freshman level course would be relatively easy for me.  I guess if you take anything from my ramble it’s to not beat your self up over not getting perfect grades all the time.  Sometimes even if you try your hardest, a   is the best you can get.

Little update: one of the questions I though was formatted incorrectly (like it was entered in as a single answer but should have been a multi answer) was confirmed to be incorrect by the professor and I was allowed to answer that question and gain the points there.  The professor also wrote me a nice email that once the test closes we could discuss the questions I got wrong as she felt the wording could have been tricky to understand.  So I do want to give her credit for a)responding quickly and kindly and b)being open to reflecting on the question integrity.

Other update: Thanks for everyone who commented and shared stories! I didn’t expect so many responses to my whining ha!  I have definitely learned a lot.  And yes, you can be a college professor with out a PhD.  My official title is assistant professor and I am tenure track.

Annnnddd one more update: The professor shared the class data, the class low was a  , the mean a  , the high a  .  She felt two questions were not worded properly so they were thrown out.

I'm a senior in my fall semester and I'm enrolled in Calculus   at a university I won't disclose. I've been struggling this semester with personal issues and decided to withdrawal from this particular course. The deadline to withdraw is not for another month so I've stayed enrolled to prepare for my second attempt and that leads me to my current issue. 

About   weeks ago, midterm   was scheduled. I didn't attend because I'm planning on withdrawing. Yesterday they posted the results and for some reason I got an  %. Before the exam I had  % in the class and now I'm at a  % which means it's possible for me to pass the course (above  %). This all brings me to my dilemma; I could let the professor know which would surely bring my grade below failing or I could wait it out and hope the mistake isn't caught allowing me the opportunity to pass. 

I honestly feel like I should email the professor and do the right thing but I wanted to know what everyone else thought. I've been thinking of nothing since when I saw the wrong grade and I have no idea what to do. Thanks in advance for the help!

EDIT: Just thought I'd update those who are curious. I decided to attend office hours a few days after this and explained the whole situation.

He said he will be changing my grade to a zero because it's a required course and the material is bound to show up again which I completely understand. He offered some extra credit in the form of attendance points (my attendance has been lacking) but I declined and told him I was planning on withdrawing before the whole mistake. Sure, I could've said nothing but it would've been weighing on my conscious for god knows how long so I'm glad I told the truth.

The second half of the assignment was reading the country's national transit company's website and watching their COVID-specific informational/rule videos and reading a commuter blog FAQ about the new restrictions.

He also told me I’m free to visit his apartment and he’d show me how to play a game, and asked for my Snapchat. I didn’t know how to say no, but I’m pretty uncomfortable with all of this. 

I’m not sure what to do now. I’m uncomfortable with this and feel like this is somewhat inappropriate because he’s my TA, but idk if this is serious enough to talk to my prof or the title   person about. I also don’t really want him to know I talked to someone about it, but as far as I know, he’s only doing it to me. Any advice?

I’m falling behind in most of my   courses this semester. Still better than last semester though. I thought about taking a break but it’s my last year and loans and everything...I figured I’d just stick it out.

Anyway, my professor messaged me yesterday with the subject “Checking in”:

Dear ______,

How are you doing? I'm writing to check in with you. I haven't heard from you in this class yet and I'd like to connect with you to figure out how I can best support you. These are difficult times and I'm more than happy to be flexible with the course.

Let me know if you want to chat over video or phone, or just check in through email.

Best,
Professor _______

I honestly teared up. It’s a small class, probably around   people, so I’m not surprised he noticed. He already has a “no penalty for late work” policy his semester that I’ve definitely been taking advantage of. 

It was just so nice to receive. To be reached out to instead of having to reach out (which is really hard sometimes). Even motivated me to make more of an effort to get stuff done for his sake. I’ll try this weekend. I haven’t replied yet, but of course I’ll thank him and be honest.

I know I did well on the final too as I prepared so hard for it. He told me he can’t just give me a grade so he wanted me to retake it but it was an in person exam but I had already left the country for the holidays.

He was very strict this entire semester and my daily grades is not even a true reflection of my knowledge in the course material since he would subtract   points etc for not putting screenshots of inputs when he only requested for screenshots of the results. 

I already sent this to our grad officer but I won’t hear back until the uni resumes on Jan  rd. This is causing me so much anxiety. I just really wish he could find my exam.

184,1604426993.0,college,"An Honest Letter from Your University President About Fall and Our Plans for SpringDear faculty and students,

Oh, and staff. I keep doing that. If I had any shame at all, I’d feel embarrassed. It’s so hard to remember people that don’t have academic freedom. You’re like Gen X; angsty and frequently forgotten in conversation.

I’m writing to follow up on my original post: [An Honest Letter from Your University President About Why We’re Opening This Fall](

First, I’d like to address the disappointing survey results we received from you. Yes, faculty, over  % of the student body is currently in quarantine or isolation, but we gave you a Zoom license and a  p webcam with a microphone that captures all sound within a two and a half foot radius. Be resilient. This sounds like a “You” problem. If you need help, ask the instructional technology group that we’ve underfunded for the past decade and kept on a hiring freeze even after they lost a quarter of their staff to private industry. 

And please stop asking if the students in quarantine are okay. They’re perfectly safe in the Holiday Inn down the road. No, the bad one. Dining Services is making sure they get their meals at least three times a week. Breakfast is an overripe grapefruit and Saltines. The vegetarian option is a chicken salad sandwich. We include a  oz bottle of water. That’s  oz per meal! For those of you who’ve asked: the wifi matches the quality of a strong home internet connection from  , so don’t let them lie to you when they get kicked out of your hybrid/flexible/in-person/circus/flipped/blended/shitshow/mishmash/Sisyphean instruction on Zoom because “their internet cut out”. They’re fine. 

Students: We built our entire reopening plan around your ability to do something all  -  year-olds excel at: Self control. Yes, this has led to a massive uncontrolled outbreak on campus, which is why we need to assign blame to the people who’ve done the most to create these incredibly dangerous circumstances: **You**. I cannot believe that when freed from the restrictions of home life with your parents, the first thing you decide to do is try to *make friends*. I mean, who does that? It's not like we've spent your entire lives selling you on the college experience. We’re trusting you.

Faculty: Since we don’t trust the ~~scapegoats~~ students, and to reassure the business faculty who are assigning tests that Pearson and McGraw Hill wrote in  , we’ve invested heavily in Proctorio. This will allow us to surveil the students from the discomfort of their apartment or dorm room (sorry, “residence hall”). Blinking more than   times in a minute, wearing red sweatpants, or having dark skin will automatically fail the student and trigger a meeting with the student conduct board. Via Zoom, of course. 

Now then, on to spring. I know many of you are feeling tired from not having any fall break, but good news! This proves we can get through a semester without *any* break. Maybe even \[drum roll\] spring break! That’s right! Instead of a much-needed break in the middle of one of the coldest, darkest, most uncomfortable times of the year with no major holidays or time off between January and April, we’ve opted to eliminate spring break in  . For those of you feeling stressed, we encourage you to try any of the following meditative exercises our Wellness Czar/CFO has provided:

* Spend time reflecting on how lucky you are to have a job. 
* Create a spreadsheet of how expensive it’d be to take a job at the next closest university  .  miles away. 
* Disconnect from social media.
* Calculate the chances someone with COVID actually washed their hands properly after they left the communal bathroom you just used. 
* Make a list of how many days it’d take for you to become homeless if you quit right now. 

If you are a faculty or staff member who fought us tooth and nail for accommodations to work remotely this fall, this does mean you’ll need to re-apply for spring. The application process will require you to submit the following to HR: A form with a detailed rationale about why you need accommodations (with citations in MLA  th edition format), two doctor’s notes (one must be from your dentist), a Starbucks gift card with exactly $ .  left on it, blood samples from your children that you personally extracted, a fourth grade report card (doesn’t have to be yours), the last five digits of your mother’s social security number, and President Obama’s long form birth certificate. The original. If you cannot provide these things, your application will be rejected. This policy should help the administration continue its decades-long tradition of disproportionately disenfranchising our female faculty and staff who have children *and* the desire to follow a meaningful career path in their field. 

Now to answer some other questions you’ve been collectively ~~pestering us with~~ asking:

No, we will not acknowledge the backbreaking burden of the affective labor staff have been doing since March. I don’t care if you’re not “fine”. Do the same thing I’m convinced you do when you say you’re working remotely: Pretend you are. Our faculty need strong, reassuring leadership, which is why  you as the people tasked with executing the mission we've created with no input, representation, or feedback from you are going to provide it. Act like everything’s normal and do it with a smile, sweetheart. 

No, we will not be paying the Student Life staff more despite the extraordinary circumstances. We let them live for free in the same dorms as their COVID-infected classmates, who they are now required to check in on daily so my administrative assistant can tell these annoying parents that their student’s taken care of when they call. The dozens of hours of overtime this semester on top of their regular courseload mean nothing. You thought we meant it when we said ""Their first job is being a student?"" Bahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, oh that was good. Wait wait, let me get the senior staff on a Zoom call so you can say that again. They're going to love this! Oh, and tell the RAs to consider this semester a life lesson on what it means to be on salary, and that “Other duties as assigned” is a literal statement. 

Yes, this semester has put the Black, Hispanic, and Latinx members of our community at higher risk since they're disproportionately represented on our environmental services and dining staff. But if they don’t like it, they can just go get another job. It’s not like we’re in the midst of a second generational recession. I mean could you even *imagine*? 

No, we will not be doing pass/fail this semester. Why does everyone keep asking that? Be resilient! When I was a junior in college I got strep throat and was out of class a whole afternoon! I did the work to keep up despite the massive hurdles placed in front of me, and I expect the same of our students. 

I feel this must be said in closing: You all seem to have forgotten that a key part of the administration’s COVID strategy is **Performative Normalcy**, so don’t expect your “pedagogical mission” or “safety” to trump our operations. We are back in-person for a reason: **Money**. I don’t know how you missed this. We sent it via email at  :  on last Friday,   minutes after we’d sent another email announcing the largest uncontrolled outbreak of the semester. Contact your supervisor if you need productivity tips for managing your email.

Your University President, PhD.",7526,1273,0

I don’t do this often as I have a packed schedule during the school year. But, on rare occasions when I do have a day off and no plans, I like to study in the dining hall and it’s like unlimited food pretty much. 

ANYWAY, I shared this with one of my friends when she asked me what I’ll do over the weekend and she said that’s not the most ethical thing to do. now I feel kind of guilty but at the same time tuition is mad expensive and even tho I’m prob not saving much, it makes me feel better. also, it’s a really nice study spot. esp since they have desert and ice cream lol 

should I stop doing this??

edit: 
wow, I really didn’t expect to come back to so many comments

thank you to everyone who shared their thoughts, and I really appreciate everyone’s perspective on this. I’m a bit shocked by how one-sided the consensus is, but for the most part I’m relieved because now I can carry on guilt free. I’m glad because our dining hall has an amazing selection of deserts and the ice cream is really yummy, lol. I can feel myself gaining weight just from these   swipes alone. 

anyway, cheers everyone, and I hope you all enjoy this semester! ",1458,277,0
186,1594490199.0,college,"Tips for the students who are worried about their college classes being all online and won’t be able to focus since they are basically self-teaching themselvesI highly recommend you guys buy the book “The Science of self-learning” that book really helped me when I was teaching myself my classes since I had two semesters in the row of all online classes (This was before covid). Also make sure you guys right every due date down. Personally I use the app “My Homework Student Planner” since I can write all my due dates down and it will give me a notification on the day of when my assignments are due so I can due that same day. It helps because I have a lot of doctor appointments because of my disability and I can easily forget if I have homework due if I don’t have a physical reminder so that text notification is really helpful.

Edit: The book “The Science of Self-learning” is by Peter Hollins

Edit Edit: Holy shit!   upvotes?!!! I don’t deserve this many I just wanted to share some tips since I did whole year of online classes and can offer some advice but thank you so much.

Edit x : if you need help focusing while studying I recommend downloading the app “Forest”. It’s an that uses the pomodoro technique. Basically you set the timer in the app and watch a tree grow. If you take your phone off the forest to go web search or something like that tree will die and and you have to start over. Most people don’t wanna see a tree die so it helps forces you to get off your phone and actually focus on what you are doing in that moment.

Edit x : If you have problems with retaining info then I suggest you write you notes in class on paper and then transfer to computer app such as Microsoft OneNote or Evernote. Since you are rewriting it you naturally will retain more of it.",1793,336,0

TLDR; I thrive on schedule but have to legitimately force myself to stick to them. I used these tips to stay on the Dean's List, procrastinate mindfully, stop wasting time on studying ineffectively, and ease the stress of   college hours with my   homeschooled kids and a job.

-MAKE A WORKSPACE: Make a little area that you keep your school stuff at. Sit there an hour a day to work, make important phone calls, ect. Your ""adulting"" spot. Dont doodle there. Dont eat dinner there. Dont play video games there. Even if it's a backpack, chair, and a tv tray. Mine is a desk in a closet. Decorate meaningfully. A school vision board and an erasable calendar maybe. 

-If you can, take notes on one word document so that you can search your notes instantly for a keyword. 

-MAKE TIME (just a little) to actually work. Everyday. Like a job. Even when you have no work to do, sit down at your desk for a bit every day and find something important to do that is unpleasant/has been put off and do it in that ""work time"". Make that appointment you havent made, call the matenience to fix the dishwasher you have been not using for a week bc you havent called, do whatever and limit the adulting to that hour and do it everyday. You'd be surprised how much an hours of actual work can get done if its consistent. But consistency is hard for me so I have to enforce it. My kids have an hour or so of nap/quiet time in their rooms while I work, and I rarely if ever need more time than that. Most of the time I spend outside of that is on important tests that cant be interrupted. 

-RITUALS: No not those. But you cant just sit down and expect to switch gears. Do something everytime you sit down to work that gets you ""in the zone."" Maybe it's a cup of water and a journal, or checking your calendar or whatever, or even a cigarette and   minutes of a game that you only play right before you buckle down, set a timer. Setting out   minutes  or so to sit at my desk and bullshit actually makes me work better. 

-ONLY HIGHLIGHT key words in notes and textbooks. If the course has many dates and names, consider highlighting those in a seperate color.

- COMBINE POWERPOINTS all the teachers powerpoints she sends out into one giant  PowerPoint that you can search for keywords efficiently.

-COPY AND PASTE all test questions that allow it into ONE master document of test questions for each class: if you can correct the wrong answers after, even better. This takes no time if you do it during the tests, or print screen after you've taken it. Not all classes allow this, though.

-INDEX everything that you cant search easily. If you do it as you go, it's easy but it's hard to get started. 

-  *Leave it for the due date* , if you have to, but not the night it's due. Work in the morning. Trust me. Wake up at the same time everyday. Do something pleasant for a limited time and then work until you're done for the day. Then you can enjoy you're whole day without the clock ticking down to  : PM when that quiz is due that you've known about for   weeks and havent done. It's going to happen, it always will, but it you do it that morning, you will always feel better. 

- Bring your snack or drink with you and dont get up, if you can manage that.

- totally optional: Bullet journals. Especially for those that love to be creative, hate taking notes, and cant seem to get organized. Everyone loves to be organized and consistent, deep down.",3734,694,0

213,1698422167.0,college,"my class has an absolutely ridiculous attendance policySomeone please try to understand the logic of this attendance policy. Now my class has lecture twice a week and a discussion section once a week. We have an attendance grade that's worth  % of our grade for lecture and an attendance/participation grade worth  % for our discussion classes. 

Now in the syllabus it states that every absence from class results in a  % grade deduction of your overall grade. That seemed completely illogical because whats the point of an attendance grade if you get docked a whole letter grade for missing class anyways right? So I went ahead and asked one of the TAs about that at the beginning of the semester and they told me that that policy only applies to our discussion sections which made sense to me. 

Now midway through the semester after I've already missed countless lectures but   discussion classes, I'm being told that the policy applies to lectures as well......

Whats the point of an attendance grade if you're losing a whole ass letter grade for missing class anyways?!?!?!

Edit: After some backlash, I wanted to clarify some things. I asked a TA about this policy **before** I started missing classes, and they explicitly told me that it did not apply to lectures. I also asked a separate TA a few weeks into class to double check, and they told me the same thing.

 .) You know what kind of person you are. By this I mean, if you want your room to be cute and decorated, don't let someone convince you that it's a waste of money/time. I loved having a cozy room to come back to and made lots of friends due to them wanting to hang out in my room.

 .) This also means you know what you use. Don't bring a water bottle if you never use one now. Don't bring that piece of clothing you haven't worn in months because it will just take up space.

 .) Keep the pandemic situation in mind. You probably don't need to pack swim suites because pools won't be open anyways. Also, stuff like a printer may not be as necessary as most classes will turn things in digitally (unless you need it to scan things)

 .) Also with the pandemic in mind, pack lightly and keep containers in your room. You want to be able to move out at a moments notice if things get really bad again.

 .) You will need a lot less clothes than you think you do but will probably overpack anyways. If you haven't worn something by the time you go home for your first break, take it home with you.

 .) If drinking/smoking isn't your thing, don't worry! There are plenty of people who choose not to for whatever reason and most people are respectful of this.

 .) If you do go out partying, you leave and come back with the same people. You make sure everyone got home safe and sound (especially the girls in your group). Don't let your girl friends walk alone at night.

 .) Probably an unpopular opinion but don't be afraid to cut your friends off if they've had too much. It's not cool to pressure someone into drinking more than their bodies can handle. Look out for all of your friends and if they don't do that for you, find new friends.

 .) If someone passes out from drinking, *PLEASE* roll them onto their side. Lots of people die every year from choking on vomit while unconscious.

 .) This may be obvious, but try your best in classes and put them above all else. You pay so much money, to do otherwise would be silly. I say this as someone who partied A LOT and still had straight A's, it's important you find a balance.

 .) Bring a basic first aid kit and some basic OTC medicine. I was very happy to have fever reducer and ibuprofen on standby when I got tonsillitis a month into school.

 .) Lots of people say a TV is a waste but we used ours a lot. Especially with the pandemic happening, you should expect to be inside a lot more anyways. (Same goes for PC set ups)

 .) You'll soon learn that people weren't raised the same as you. Set guidelines with your roommates about cleaning/partying/bringing people over ect. during the first couple days of school. Also, bring up issues with your roommates as soon as they're on your radar.

 .) Be safe if you're hooking up. Let a friend/roommate know where you're going, I found using snap location made me feel safer. Also wrap it up!

 .) Some stuff that I brought that was never used included: Ear plugs, desk lamp, paper clips, post its, water bottle, swimsuit. It all depends on the person though. Ear plugs are good to bring just in case, better to have and not need than to never have them at all.

 .) If you have a car on campus, maybe keep that low key unless you want people asking for rides all the time.

 .) Be safe. Wear a mask outside your dorm at all times. To not do this is so selfish and you're not only endangering yourself, but those around you and everyone they come into contact with. Maybe you would be fine if you got covid, but the asthmatic kid down the hall may not be so lucky. You are not invincible and life will soon show you otherwise if you think that.

 . Share location with good friends. I understand you don’t want your parents tracking you but it is a good idea for your friends to know where you are or your last location in the event you go missing or need help sent to you. If you have a date that night let someone know. 

 . Be very cautious when meeting anyone from online for the first time including tinder, bumble etc. when meeting someone for the first time meet them in public or in your housing. Do not go alone to a strangers house. You could be assaulted by the person your meeting or worse walk into a set up. 

 . Have your own alcohol (I would include drugs in this too) Do not take random drinks from anyone including other women. Bring your own alcohol to parties or stick to sealed beverages such as cans or drinks being served to everyone such as beer from a keg. Avoid any random concoctions. 

 . Drink among friends. Do not go out alone always have at least one friend with you. Be aware of each other’s where abouts throughout the party. 

 . Make sure everyone is accounted for. Everyone who came together leaves together. (I personally have seen this problem happen) While going out in a large group of friends may seem safer but it is not. The more girls, the easier it is to lose someone without realizing. If two girls go out they are unlikely to leave each other during the party and you would notice immediately if the only person you know is missing. In a group of friends it can be easy to lose someone because of diffusion of responsibly, everyone is talking to someone else, someone must know where she is mentality. It is easy to lose one girl when party or bar hopping throughout the night in a group. Keep track of your friends. 

 . Do not go to the bathroom alone. (I personally know of a girl who was followed into a bathroom and raped while at a house party) This one is more so for house parties than bars as bar bathrooms aren’t single stall so many women are in there at once also bar staff tends to keep an eye on bathrooms for all sorts of reasons. Bring a friend into the bathroom with you or at least to stand outside. It is very easy at a party for a predator to follow a girl into a bathroom and for bystanders to assume they are a couple looking for privacy. Never use a bathroom in a secluded part of the house alone.  If you are followed into a bathroom scream your head off for help. People will care I promise. 

 . Make sure your phone is charged before you go anywhere. You do not want to be in a situation where you are unable to call   or a friend or an Uber. Keep your phone on you as much as possible. 

 . Always have a healthy level of caution in a professional or educational setting. Meet professors before class instead of after. Schedule one on one meetings in less secluded places if the option is given to you. Such as meeting a tutor in a library instead of dorm room. Bring a friend along if the matter is not confidential when meeting a professor or other college staff member. 

 . Have a healthy level of caution among friends. Predators are stereotyped as strangers who hide in bushes but many sex crimes are committed by a person who knows the victim such as a friend of a friend, friends boyfriend or brother or even a friend themself. Be careful where you sleep. Always sleep in your own bed whenever possible. Do not sleep on a friends couch in a house with many people in the house. 
Be selective about who sleeps in your house as well. 

 . Just because someone attends the same school as you does not mean you “know them”. Many girls who would never dream going back to a strangers house think it’s safe to go back to the room or house of someone they just met simply because they are also a student at that school. This person is still a stranger. 

 . Other women are not always friends. (This one applies mostly to sex trafficking and abductions) Many girls are lured by other women into being victimized. Predators are often smart and realize women are much less suspicious of other women. Be wary of anyone who randomly approaches you with a “job offer” like modeling or photography. A random woman in social media trying to get you to meet her somewhere is another one. 

 . Stay away from the worst. In college do not let a little youthful rebellion or college partying make you think there is anything glamorous about a life of crime. You may feel invincible but you are not. There is a very big difference between college kids experimenting with drugs or making fake ids and being a career criminal. Practice good common sense. College aged women are very vulnerable to being manipulated into sex work by drug addict boyfriends or pimps. College is a time for taking risks and having fun but do not take it too far. 

 . Educate yourself on the signs and behaviors of an abusive boyfriend. This will allow you to educate yourself before potentially entering an abusive relationship that will ruin your college years.

 . Do not go home with anyone you met that night. You can give your phone number and agree to meet another day. If you really want to see more of them that night bring them back to your housing. This will you to be in control of the situation and your safety. If they refuse to go to your housing instead of theirs that is a major read flag. Going home with a stranger after drinking leaves you vulnerable to many potential problems or high risk behaviors. Ranging from assault from the person you went home with or his roommates, to impulsive consensual unprotected sex.

 . If you see something not right happening get involved. Be a friend to a girl who needs it. Do not let your school be a place where violence against women is tolerated.",5791,1070,0

I know it's so easy to procrastinate, to push your work aside and cram in the very last minute. You tell yourself that you'll work on it after watching an episode of your show, or after taking a nap because you're too exhausted to start this assignment. After hours of putting off your work, you finally decide to open your laptop and start. You click on the assignment and   minutes later you find yourself on your phone, distracted once again. 

I just wanted to remind you that you are completely capable of acing your classes, of earning the grades you'll be happy with. All it takes is a conscious effort to complete your assignments and set aside time for your studies. 

Procrastination stems from fear, and the key is to do your work despite *feeling* like you want to procrastinate. There is no physical barrier between you and your assignments, it's all mental. So, ground yourself, stop the self sabotaging, and get it done. You’ll feel awesome and accomplished and still have time to do everything else you like. Nothing is above you, nothing is too difficult for you, and you are more than capable of being *that* student.

At this time of year, there seem to be lots of posts about asking to raise your grades.  There is only one acceptable reason to do this, which is if you have good reason to believe that there was a transcription error.  Asking for a higher grade just because you wish you had done better in a class will not work.  Asking for an extra credit assignment at the end of the semester, after your professor has already assigned you a grade lower than you would have liked, will not work.  Not only will it not work, it will hurt your reputation with your professors almost as much as cheating does.

Start saving your drafts when writing to avoid accusations of AI cheating.I've been stumbling across more and more posts of students getting zeroes for writing their own papers.

That being said, SAVE YOUR DRAFTS! Especially with large essay assignments, you should start savings proof! Your grade is YOURS, and the last thing we should be doing as students is giving our professors the power to discredit our hard work on the basis of internet tools they aren't willing to understand, without any ways of defending ourselves. 

These detectors aren't going anywhere. In fact, they're likely to go even more mainstream, and soon will be affecting  the whole industry. Don't let your professors hold that power over you, because these situations can happen to you, and I want you all to be able to save your grades.

Advice?I am in my final quarter at a community college, and I am admitted to a large university in fall quarter this year and was accepted to my major. My acceptance to the program was contingent upon the completion of one final course, so I was taking the course this summer and was to send my final transcript over once final grades had been posted. Everything was going well, I had a  % in the class, and submitted my final assignment this Tuesday. 

I check my email today and see that my professor gave me a   on the final project, which brought my grade down to a failing grade as it accounted for  % of our total grade. The only feedback she gave was ""You are not allowed to use outside resources and AI generated responses"". I absolutely DID NOT use AI or use any outside resources. The assignment was computational and I showed my work. The only resources I used were notes that I had taken throughout the quarter, most of which were directly paraphrased from her lectures. She gave no rubric for the final project and I don't even understand how she could have extrapolated me using ChatGPT for a math project? 

I am absolutely shocked and I feel so upset. She reported it to the college board which means this will be on my record and I am extremely afraid that my acceptance to the university will be rescinded/revoked. I have worked so, so hard for the past   years and I have never once been accused of cheating or anything of the sort. Has anyone every experienced something like this before? What do I do?

UPDATE: I emailed her and we are speaking tomorrow. I am scared because i know she’s going to ask to see the version history, but the issue is that I work on google docs and convert to word doc to submit because she only accepts word files. The word doc doesn’t have an edit history because of this, and the file is completely gone from google docs and I cannot recover it seemingly. Fuuuuuu*k me! Thanks for all the support and advice guys!

UPDATE  : Alright so i met with my professor. I don’t know why I was anticipating her to be more understanding of this whole situation, but she was extremely accusatory and confrontational seeming that she was  % certain that I had cheated. Her explanation was that I used a method to solve an equation that she allegedly never showed us, therefore I must have looked it up or had a bot complete the problem for me. I proceeded to tell her that in one of her lectures that she shared (pre recorded from seven years ago, she hasn’t updated anything since), she mentioned this method as one of three acceptable methods of solving the problem. So for the whole quarter, i had been using this method. I even found the video clip of her referencing this method. She back tracked and said that she never provided the specific template for this method, so i must have had to look it up. I showed her that I found the template from the assigned textbook. Then, she proceeded to ask me other impromptu exam questions for me to solve on the spot which I could not do because this is an intro level class and I am not yet equipped to solve these philosophical math questions on a whim. While i tried to answer these questions, she made mocking/confused faces at me.

Once she had prodded me about everything, I simply asked her if she was going to proceed with reporting this to the school board. She said she would not do this, but there were numerous other students that made the same mistake (?) as me that she will be reporting. She did not fix the grade, but will all my completed work, i rounded out to a C and i am okay with that as long as I do not have academic dishonesty on my record.

282,1606235453.0,college,"Here's what might happen to you if you get caught cheatingWell, I never thought this would happen but it did. As we all know, online courses have been a mess this semester. In particular my chemistry class has been hell. Our average test scores are  %- %. I usually get lower, and chemistry has never been my strong suit. 

Since this is reddit, im not going to lie. On our  rd exam last week I was having trouble with a few questions. Our tests are technically open note, but I went to the one place that is usually off limits: chegg. I searched some questions and some people had clearly copied and pasted the exam questions to chegg, and received answers. To my credit I did look at the explanation of questions and figured out how the answer became to be, but ultimately I did see the answer and therefore put that answer into my exam. 

Yesterday my professor sent an email about how people posted the exam questions on chegg and how my schools Dean Of Students would be contacting chegg to request who posted the questions AND who accessed the questions. He mentioned how the penalties will be lesser if those who cheated came forward on their own. So I did. 

Because I came forward and its my first offense, my punishments include a   on the exam, have to take an online academic integrity course, and get an official report filed at the Dean of Students just to have it on record in case I offend again. The real part that sucks? I work within the Dean of students which makes this  x more embarrassing. Im pretty sure nothing will happen to my employment, but there's still a worry in the back of my mind. 

I never thought about using chegg to be honest. All of my roommates use it even on exams and a lot of other people in my class cheated on this exam as well. Its so common I didn't think anything would happen. But it did and its my mistake and I take the consequences. 

Basically. I want this to be a warning. I've learned a huge lesson, and I deactivated my chegg account. Id rather get a C in the class vs getting suspended from my university. Even though my punishments can be seen as mild, it certainly wasn't worth it.

Edit: there are people calling me dumb and an idiot in the comments because they believe my professor tricked us into confessing. I dont know exactly what to believe, because on cheggs policy they say they can and will give out extensive information on who accessed certain questions, meanwhile threads on r/professor say differently. The point is no matter if I was baited or not, I learned my lesson from looking at chegg and won't be doing it again. I find it takes my integrity to admit mistakes then try to get away with everything. Sometimes its just better to receive the necessary punishment and learn for the future.

But since Covid, I've joined this subreddit because I want to know what's going on with students' mental health, but don't want my students to feel weirded out if I ask.

What I've learned is that a lot of you are Not Doing Okay.   And that Covid-  and online learning is really, really stressing you out.   And I'm sorry that I don't have any good answers for that.

But the other thing I see is people struggling on how to study in college, which is so different from studying in High School.

Unfortunately, a lot of students are missing out on the very thing that would help you out.  **I'm NOT SAYING THIS BECAUSE IT'S WHAT I THINK, I'M SAYING THIS BECAUSE THIS IS THE F\*\*KING SCIENCE.**

There have been SOOOO many epistemological studies about easy things you can change regarding note-taking that will literally improve your grades, your exams, and your general understanding.

Some of you will know all of this already.  But note-taking isn't just something we're born knowing how to do and bugs the hell out of me that no one bothers to ever teach it.

So for those who don't know what are essentially ""study hacks"", here's the science:

# # ) TAKING NOTES BY HAND AUTOMATICALLY STICKS INSIDE YOUR MEMORY MORE THAN TAKING NOTES ON A LAPTOP DOES, EVEN IF YOU NEVER LOOK AT YOUR NOTES AGAIN.

(Link to the study: [ )

When it comes to remembering facts, like ""When did the civil war start?"" there wasn't much of a difference.  

However, when it comes down to understanding the CONCEPTS, students who wrote longhand did unbelievably better.  As in three times better.   If you want to know why they did so much better, go to hack # .

# # ) USING YOUR OWN WORDS TO WRITE DOWN NOTES IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN WRITING DOWN EXACTLY WHAT THE PROFESSOR SAYS IN THE LECTURE.

Directly from the study: ""Overall, p**articipants who took more notes performed better whether or notebook or laptop,** β =  . , p = . , partial R  = . . ***However, those whose notes had less verbatim overlap with the lecture performed \[even\] better,*** β = − . , p = . , partial R  = .   


For instance, if the prof's slide says: 

`""Psychologists have investigated a phenomenon known as “attitude inoculation,” which works on the same principle as vaccination, and involves exposing people to weak arguments against a viewpoint they hold.""`  


Don't write that down verbatim.  Write down what it \*means\* and in your own words.  Something like:

`If you challenge someone's opinion with weak arguments, but a lot of them, they'll actually double-down on their opinion`

Or, for real shorthand, fast

`Lots of weak arguments = they'll double down`

So long as you can tell what that means.

# # ) VISUALS HELP

Draw whatever helps you understand the concept, be it graphs or maps or whatever.   Such as:  


WATCH THIS VIDEO:  

It's from a guy that scored  . th percentile in his med school classes, and he attributes it to his note-taking skills:

&#x B;

# # ) HERE'S THE BIG BIG BIG BIG HACK THAT WILL SAVE YOU THE MOST TIME:

Review your notes within twenty-four hours.  This can save you hours of extra studying in the long run.

Make sure it's within   hours though!   Science isn't  % sure why it has to be done within that time frame, but it could be because of (theoretical but certainly not debunked) ""neural dumping.""  Basically, this means as you sleep at night your brain shits out all the information that is non-essential.

Guess what's non-essential:  calculus.  history.  English lit.     Sure, not to you, but to your brain?  It says, ""F\*\*k it, we need the space.  Get rid of this crap.""

Let me know if any of this is helpful, or if it's just mostly annoying stuff that you already know.

Take care guys.  It's only   years of hell, I promise.  After that, it's only   more years of hell in the workforce, but at least it's a different kind of hell.

315,1583969193.0,college,"Some tips for online classesI saw a lot of stuff on r/college lately from students who have not taken online classes before. Since I teach both online and face-to-face (and have for some time) I thought I'd share some of the tips (and other considerations) with regard to online classes.

Tips:

 . First and foremost, it is WAY easier to skip the work when it's online. I plan on having asynchronous lectures for my switch over to online, but even for those faculty hosting live lectures, it will be much tougher to focus. Try to set up an environment where you can stay focused. Wear actual clothes, get your coffee, act like you would if you were in a face-to-face class so your brain doesn't try to switch into ""relax"" mode on you. Try to watch the videos/lectures around the same time your class would have met since you are already in the routine for it.

 . Take notes like you would in a regular class. Again, when it's online (especially recorded) it might feel silly to take notes. But notes help you learn, face-to-face or otherwise.

 . PARTICIPATE! You will not get to hear other students' questions as much (if at all, depending on the format). There is not really an easy way to do discussions so the more you make an effort to participate, the more everyone will get out of it. If you have questions on the material, for the love of God make sure you ask them because no one else is going to ask them for you as often happens in traditional classes.

 . Exams are probably going to be different. You might get a prof that just throws the multiple choice exam online, but most are aware that it is so easy to cheat online that they will format online exams differently. You will see lots more randomization of questions, question order, and answer choice order. You might see online proctor services like Lockdown Browser or Respondus Monitor that literally lock you out of everything but the exam and then record you taking it via webcam. You might end up getting an open book exam that is much more difficult.

 . Usually, you'd be in class about  .  hours a week and (hopefully) studying and doing some assignments on top of that. You should keep with that pattern. Assume it'll take you ~ .  hours just to go through all the learning content. I think a lot of students just erase the class time from their brain and try to just rush through everything, which would not be possible in a face-to-face. This is another way that setting up a ""class time"" for yourself can really help.

 . Editing to add this one: Every prof is going to do this differently. Some might livestream lectures, some might record them, some might not lecture at all. It is really important you keep an eye on your emails, check your notification settings on Canvas/Blackboard/whatever, and get comfortable with   or   slightly different versions of this.

The best way I can sum this up is that in a traditional class you are often or at least often can get away with being a passive consumer of the content. In an online class you have to be more of an active participant in your own learning. 

Other considerations:

 . Many--MANY--of your professors hate teaching online and have no idea how to do it right. They have never had to before. It is not as simple or easy as it might seem to design a good online learning experience and many faculty have no experience with it and no time to learn. We are all dealing with this change, so try to be patient the best you can. 

 . Be open-minded. I teach a topic that can be put online pretty easily, but I have no clue how you would put a chem lab or an acting class online. And neither do a lot of faculty. This will be testing the creativity of many professors. Every course has learning objectives you are expected to be assessed on, and they will have to find a way to do that.

 . Technical issues are going to be rampant, both because of the pressure put on the learning management systems and because of instructor incompetence + poor user interfaces. Don't start stuff at the last minute. It's not a good idea in general but you run the risk of technical issues preventing you from finishing. Your professors are not tech support either and chances are they have no clue what's wrong. You should probably contact your campus tech support folks for help, not your professor, unless you're sure it's something wrong on their end.

 . Editing to add: Everything is going to be just fine. It's going to be weird. It's going to be an adjustment. But ultimately if you pay attention to your profs and keep up with the work this will just have been an inconvenience in the end.

I'm sure others can chime in with more suggestions or comments. Good luck with the transition.",4716,854,0

Our agreement was that I do the entire PowerPoint and they were supposed to do the presenting part because I had my midterm scheduled at that time and couldn't make it to the meeting. On the day of the presentation, one of them messaged me saying they couldn't make it due to their mother being sick and the other didn't even bother to go.

I'm considering whether to talk to my professor about this. I don't want to seem like I'm making excuses, but at the same time, I feel it's unfair that my grade suffered because of a situation out of my control. Do you think it's worth bringing up with my professor? Has anyone been in a similar situation?

**Update:** Thanks to everyone for the input and advice! I spoke with my professor about the whole scenario and she was very understanding and allowed us to present at a later date.

To provide some context:  The class is actually online, and our presentations were scheduled during a Zoom meeting. Our professor gave us the flexibility to divide the work however we saw fit, even allowing just one person to present if that's what we decided.

I had a midterm at  pm, and our class runs from  :  to  pm. I let my group know about this conflict in advance, and we agreed that I'd handle the entire PowerPoint while the other two would do the presenting. At the time, it didn’t cross my mind to inform my professor about my midterm clash, especially since my group mates had been super reliable throughout the semester.

There are no scheduled Zoom meetings and all lectures are prerecorded. Everyday since the course began my professor sends out a message via the class Chat feature about some obscure holiday, his dog, or a sports game; until last week. At the start of the course, he informed us he had COVID, so I'm a bit worried. However, there was recently a group of students who asked him to stop with his daily Chat messages as it clouds up their emails. The day my classmates did this was also the last time my professor sent out a message (two hours prior to the message my classmates sent) so I feel like he might have gone silent as per their wishes. Still, he hasn't uploaded our final exam to the Module, or graded the last test we took. As far as I can tell, its just him and his elderly dog. 


Assuming the worst, what do I do? Who do I contact?

Edit: Another classmate and I messaged/emailed our professor a few hours before I posted this.

Update: A classmate said she emailed our professor a few days ago and has not gotten a response. Another classmate has informed us that he has reached out to the department head.

Update  : Another classmate left a voicemail with the Dean's assistant earlier today. She got a response from HR letting her know that the Dean has been in contact with our professor, who is seemingly having technical issues. Looks like we weren't the only ones having trouble reaching him. We're expected to get ""more information regarding this course tomorrow or ASAP"". I will post another update when I hear from the Dean or the professor.

Update  : I received an email from the Department Head just a few hour ago, she says our professor is fine and working to resolve the technical issues. In all honesty, I don't buy it. It has been nearly two weeks since we heard from our professor and he would have realized immediately that there was a problem. Finals are this week, and I would've expect the school to have resolved the issue by now. I think the school knows he passed and doesn't want to tell us until after final exams are over. I hope this isn't the case, but we aren't being given much information. In any case, I'll post another update when I hear from my professor or the Department staff.

Update  : I just finished taking the final for this class. I'm still unsure if it is the professor who uploaded it since the format wasn't given in its usual manner. My writing assignment has been graded, but the rubric is straight forward enough anyone can grade it. Our last test has not been graded and this test does require knowledge of the course to grade properly. There still hasn't been a response to my message from the professor yet. I plan to keep in contact with him over the summer to make sure he's ok. I'll post my final update when grades have been submitted, when I get a response to my message, or the school contacts me.

Final update: My professor finally responded. He is ""frighteningly ill"" and was locked out of his iPhone. I think he forgot his password to Canvas, which was more than likely stored in his phone.

I have a professor who teaches   classes back to back that are required for my minor. I just took the first this past semester and I’m about to take the second this upcoming semester. The class is small ( ish people) and all but   people who took the class last semester are taking the one next semester. 

The professor has zero work-life balance and struggles staying professional both in and out of the classroom. She’s also not from the country I go to school in, and usually she falls on that excuse when someone criticizes her behavior.

My issue:

On the first day of class, she made us sign up for a texting app, Pronto in order to communicate with us outside of class instead of using email. She has completely abused the this app, demanding near constant communication from me and my classmates. She would often text us at (or even after)  pm asking us to watch  + minute long videos and send paragraphs on what we thought of them. If we don’t respond by our  am class she would deduct points and yell at everyone, including the people who did do it. 

I was trying to keep my head down and just suffer through the class because she is the only professor that teaches it and I need the credits for my minor. I don’t think I can just do that anymore. 

Today she sent us an assignment that will take minimum of   hours and demanded we have it done by next week. The semester doesn’t start until  .  weeks from now. I refuse to do an assignment during my break for a class I’m not even in yet, and I’m not sure how much patience I have for this behavior next semester. 

Several classmates of mine, including myself, are planning to write a formal complaint to the department. I’m pretty sure we have a leg to stand on, but I just wanted to double check with yall before I attach my name on this email. 

Thus, given this information, do we have the right to complain? 

If yall have any other advice, I am happy to listen too! Thank you for reading all this.

UPDATE:

I’ll keep it short and sweet, but basically we tried to work it out with her and she claimed that she had every right to assign work since “its hardly a new class” (????). Anyway, that email got forwarded to the department head and the assignment was promptly shut down. 

Also many of you were right, Pronto is not approved by the school and violates IT stuff. Not sure what they’re gonna do with her, but thank you guys so much for the support and advice!!

Our signature assignment in stats was interpreting   data sets about “social media usage”

In English, I have written   papers that included some sort of social media propaganda. One was a presentation about “teen mental health”, citing social media as a huge factor. The other was about “using social media in a constructive way”.

372,1645663649.0,college,"Unpopular opinion: I like online classes more than in-person and I'm gonna tell you whyI have heard a lot of people complain about online classes. They find that they are less motivated to do the work, there isn't much social interaction, and you basically have to teach yourself the subject. 

I hear you. I really do. It can be tough and frustrating at times. Especially when you have a question and instead of just raising your hand or swinging by your professor's office, you have to set up a zoom meeting or wait for an email response that will probably only answer half of your question. 

The thing I like about online classes, however, is that I can: 

* Work more during the hours I would have been stuck in a classroom
* No commuting to and from campus
* I can do the homework at a time that is convenient for me
* I can rewatch lectures if I don't understand it the first time instead of having to scribble notes as fast as I can and....oh he changed the slide before I could finish this chicken-scratch of a diagram that I won't be able to read later anyway. Sad. 
* Not have to put up with the loudmouths or know-it-alls in the classroom
* I can do the work anywhere I want in whatever outfit I want (the pajama game is strong)

For anyone who has issues with procrastinating like I do (literally me writing this post right now instead of doing Spanish homework), I recommend a couple of tricks I picked up after taking  + completely online college classes:

 . Make a schedule and put the due-dates of assignments a couple of days ahead of when they are actually due. This will (hopefully) help with not putting it off until the last minute. I figure that for small assignments, I need at least one day to do a good job and two to three days for bigger assignments. That way I can work on it in little chunks instead of sitting there stressing about a ten-page paper that's due by midnight the day you even think to start working on it. 
 . Work on it in bite-size pieces. Like I said, don't stress yourself out by trying to do everything the day-of. Break the assignment down into manageable chunks and do one part at a time. For a big research paper, for example: Set the due date for four days ahead.

* On **day one**, open the assignment and see what it's asking for. Start by figuring out what you're supposed to be researching. If you get to pick your own topic, spend the day finding something that both meets the papers criteria and that  also interests you. If that's the only thing you get done on day one, that's totally fine. You'll still have three more days to finish it, but at least you're slightly ahead of the game now. 
* **Day two** and **three** should be the actual research and beginning the paper. Try to finish the paper by day three if you can, but it's okay if it doesn't happen. Just try to get close.
* **Day four** is proof-reading and refining before submitting it that night. 

Another piece of advice: Actually email your professor if you get stuck on something. They usually offer online office hours and emails are highly encouraged. I have never had a professor be upset or bothered for me asking a question about something I didn't understand. You aren't bothering them, you aren't stupid for not understanding the material. Just. Email. Them. That's what you're paying them for anyway - to teach you. So let them. 

I could add so much more to this post but I'll leave it at this for now. I hope this eases your fears or unsureness of an online class. They aren't that bad and I actually really like them because of how flexible they are.",3591,662,0

I’ve managed to get all A’s every semester of college up to this point but as you can imagine, this semester was extra hard. I was hanging on to a B in all three classes for basically the entire semester and fighting tooth and nail just to keep it that way. But I managed to get my physics grade up right before the end of the semester.

Ochem was what really shocked me. All assignments graded put me at an  . She did say she would curve our final grade but I didn’t think it would do anything for me, but it brought me up to an A.

376,1656862994.0,college,"Exposing the Disney College Program*if y'all can be so kind to crosspost, we'll get more views on this*

Hi everyone. I recently left my role in the Disney College Program and I thought I would come on here to honestly tell y'all what that experience was like. This is going to be extremely candid, raw and honest. Some of y'all may not like that, and may not like to hear this, but it is all the  % truth and I feel like needs to be told.

 For starters, when we applied, there was no interview, but in order to accept our program we had to pay   dollars. The   dollar charge was required whether we lived at Flamingo Crossings (Disney's housing for CP's) or off property in our own place. We paid   dollars to come work for Disney, which already was odd, but I didn't think much of it at the time. Then, for those living at Flamingo they went over the rent and roommate processes. For rent, it is automatically taken out of your paycheck weekly, meaning you may only have  -  dollars to live on after that. The room layouts come in  x  (  bedrooms   bathrooms),  x  and  x  (  beds in a room with one bathroom per each room). They tell us that we have the option to pick if we want our rooms to be gender neutral or not, and that we have the option to link with one roommate with the exact same start and end dates. What they did *not* tell us is that if you don't link with someone and pick gender neutral they will often throw you with anyone. There was a case where an   year old girl got put into a  x  with an older gentleman, as you can finish college at any age. You don't get told who your actual roommate is until  . You arrive there on your check in date and  . You sign your lease. Even if you link with someone, they don't bother to tell you that you may still not get out with them. So if you're in a  x , you may each get put with the other roommate. For many people who have called Flamingo asking them about roommate issues, or their potentially unsafe matches, the response they have been met with is ""We cannot guarantee your safety"". 

Then there was disability accomodations. My friend, who ended up being my roommate, has celiacs disease. When she went to get an accomodation for her program they connected her with a case advocate who worked to help her get a role that was safe for her. For any of y'all that don't know, celiacs disease makes it so you have a serious autoimmune reaction to gluten, even if it's just simply inhaling particles of it in the air, and it can put you out for weeks or send you to the hospital. Well so she told them her main accommodation she needed was a role that wasn't food and beverage. So where did they put her? Food and beverage. Then she had to fight tooth and nail to get them to change that. Mind the fact this was *before* we even started working. 

Now let's jump to working and arriving. After you move into housing, you are required to go to Traditions, which is the start of your program. At Traditions our speaker blatantly told us ""There will be days you feel depressed, anxious, and not want to go into work. But you *will* go into work regardless. And you are to always smile. Why? Because the guest doesn't care. The guest doesn't care what you're going through"". After that they sent us to get our ID's made, and to finish our registration process. They had us line up to each be asked individually for our information. One part of that was that they asked up, out loud in front of everyone, what our weight was. As you can imagine that was fun for lots of people. 

Jumping into working: they tell you that you are to have  /  availability. The rule is that they need to give you at least an   hour window between shifts. That's their only rule. So they can schedule as much as humanly possible, for as long as they want as long as they give you   hours between then and your next shift. It is extremely common for CP's to be scheduled upwards of   days in a row with no breaks, and shifts up to and often times over   hours. One of my friends got scheduled   days in a row, with almost every day being a   hour shift out in the blazing Florida sun, and one of the days even was a   hour shift. One of my other close friends went into their leader to tell them how exhausted they were with their program and how they felt they needed a break, and that their mental health was declining and their leader responded ""you came here to work, so get back out there and work"". She has type   diabetes and when her number got super low one day she told her leaders she needed an Early Release because she didn't feel good, to which they told her ""The only way we will let you go home is if you are passed out on the ground or need an ambulance"". Now I will say, not every leader is like this, as with anything in life there are good leaders and bad leaders, but sadly this experience with leaders being like this was all too common to hear about at Disney. It also wasn't uncommon to be force extended. At my location we had a huge amount of people one night get force extended, and some of them got put on shifts up to   hours. Which in Florida this all surprisingly is legal.

Throughout the program, you learn very quickly that people start self-terming (quitting) left and right. Tons of people came to the program thinking it would help their depression and anxiety because Disney is their happy place, only to have their conditions seriously worsened and have to leave. The vast majority of CP's you talk to will tell you that they hated working at Disney. Some will tell you they liked it, but also hated and noticed all the aforementioned issues. I fell in the middle, as I did love assisting guests, and my coworkers, but that was the only thing holding me on. Disney also gave us a self admission pass, stating that our one benefit of the program was getting into the parks for free. Well that would've been great if we weren't pretty much blocked out from the parks all the time, and we're given the time between shifts to even go. The vast majority of the time we wanted to go to the parks, it was fully blocked out meaning it was unavailable to even go. We were allowed to put in ADO, meaning approved days off, on our HUB to state that we needed specific days off in the future. If we got our ADO approved it meant no matter what we were to not be scheduled. Well I once got my ADO's approved for a week,   months in advance, where relatives were coming down including my   year old grandma. Only about a week or so before those dates they decided ""nope, we take it back"" and scheduled me anyways, so I had to fight to get at least a few of those days off and then call out the other days which put points on my record. 

For me, due to operational need in the middle of my program they told me my role was being switched. I didn't mind this too much, but then they put me in a role that my disability accomodations didn't allow for. So going to work each day in food and beverage caused me to have allergic reactions  each day. After a week of that I advocated and said I cannot go back into this location, it's too dangerous for me, and that I need my role switched. The leave administration team told me that if I brought in a doctor's note saying I needed a certain amount of days off, that they would honor those days off until I got my role changed and that the points wouldn't go on my record. So I sent in a doctor's note, and they told me I had those days approved and they would tell my leaders and get me in contact with my case advocate so we can do a role change. Seven days into that I get a call from my internship coordinator telling me that they told me false information and that every day I've been out, points are going on my account and that if I don't go back into work soon I would be fired. So I hustled to get in contact with my case advocate and rush to get my role changed, and after   weeks they finally got things changed. They told me they would go on and contact my leaders to get the points removed from my account, because a certain amount of points means you're fired, regardless if it's your fault or not. Did they get those points taken off? Nope, instead my case advocated actually ghosted me. My friend had the same case advocate and he ghosted them too.   months later and still no points had been taken off and I had gotten reprimands for something that wasn't my fault. 

Jumping forward, after a while in my new role, which I actually did enjoy at times because of my coworkers, I decided that the pros of this definitely did not outweigh the cons and I decided to self term. Since leaving the program, my mental health has gotten exponentially better, I have time to actually enjoy Florida and do things that I am passionate about. Not everything in the program was bad, I had some leaders I personally really liked, my coworkers have become some of my best friends, and I got the experience of being able to truly see what I do and don't want for myself. I am greatful that I did the program because it taught me to advocate for myself and it also made me realize my self worth and what I do not need to put up with. It also gave me an opportunity to move to Florida, where I will be staying from now on. I choose to have a healthy relationship with Disney now and have decided for me, Disney is only for visiting, not for working and I don't want to mesh those two things in my mind anymore. I guess the moral here is that if something doesn't feel right, and you feel like you're being mistreated, you do not need to sit there and let that happen, it is okay to say ""this is enough"" and leave something when it's seriously affecting your mental and emotional well-being.",9699,1845,0

Reminders from the LMS sometimes get lost.

I'm doing course planning for an upcoming class and looking at doing text reminders.  It would be  % optional and in addition to content pushed out through the LMS/email.  I would encourage students to use a bogus phone number (ie, Google Voice number) if they want to keep their actual number private.

Thoughts? Is it worth my time to set this up for students?

EDIT: Thank you for all the input!  I will definitely be incorporating this AS AN OPTION for students next year to opt-in if they wish.  Based on your suggestions, everything will still ALSO go out via the LMS (where I have weekly posts of what's due etc).",1001,173,0

Like oh let's go to this place it has great deals, or how they can't go out or do this activity because they're broke, or how this restaurant is too expensive for them, etc. when it's just $  for a meal plus tip.


Then during Spring break or, because I graduated recently, after graduation, literally all these people are traveling the world. One guy I know like this visited   countries in   continents. Another group of girls did a trip to   European countries. Some other person I know went to visit big US cities. Like, damn, I thought we were both sort of in the same boat but I guess you come from money? Unless it's your parents financing these trips to France or Singapore with your friends.


Unless I'm tripping or something. For the record, my background is ""never going on a plane unless it's visiting my family in Asia every  -  years."" And I already know how much that costs. I didn't come from much money at all, but in college I got some internships that paid $ /hr and then $ /hr. So these same people acting like I'm rich now are traveling the world with their friends or family and that's not something I could even imagine.

Hell, one girl I know straight up said she couldn't afford to buy lunch outside of her meal plan bc her bank account legit had only $ . Then next week she comes with her newest phone and the week after she's ubering to parties. All daddy's money (unironically btw, I asked her and she said her dad just venmoed her like a grand for the week) but it's so weird to me.


Is it just me or is stuff like this common as hell? And for the record, I go to a state school. None of these are international students. They're typically not cosplaying being poor.


Edit: Lots of people are focusing on the $  + tip point which is a really not the main point at all. I mentioned that because for me personally that's a lot (I think $  or less is fine and anything more usually hurts to buy) but $  + tip is good for like a once-in-awhile thing. And the people I'm mentioning eat out way more than me. It's not like I'm carelessly going out for expensive meals. In college I ate out like once or twice a week max with like a $ -  meal, the rest I just cooked. In my examples it's more like I will spend $  on   meals a month and maybe $  eating in at a restaurant once every  .  months while these guys be spending like $  on starbucks every day and $ -  on delivery several times a week, but anything more as a single purchase is expensive.",2636,505,0

Students are having fucking mental breakdowns and reaching burnout all over the place, and everyone talks about it as if it's just a quirky side effect of going to college. WTF.

My previous uni literally set up a ""crying chamber"" to ""let out all the stress"" so ""you can go back to studying with a clear head again"".

If you need a refresher (and oh my god some of you really do):

""Liberal arts"" refers to degrees focusing in the humanities, mathematics, and social & physical sciences. A ""Liberal arts college"" is a college specializing in undergraduate degrees in these subjects. 

No, a university that *has* these degrees does not necessarily make it ""liberal arts."" 

No, ""the arts"" are not the same thing. The arts can refer to a lot of things, but in general it just means creative means of expression, both fine arts and in things such as film, theater, and literature. 

""Liberal Arts Education"" *can* refer to the general education system in some instances. In general it's a similar concept to a ""liberal arts college,"" but context is very necessary here.

No, ""Liberal arts"" has nothing to do with the political ""liberal."" Liberal arts in this instance is derived from the latin *Liberalis ars* which generally means ""free art / practice.""

TL;DR: Social science, physical science, philosophy, math, and literature. Sometimes it means ""general education."" No, it's not political. You can be conservative and have a liberal arts degree.

437,1637259641.0,college,"Calculus Professor just assigned   hours of lecture, and   quizzes over Thanksgiving break… Please help.I wish I was making this up… 

I’m a Freshman in Calc   and due to my professor rambling on and on in class about useless stories, and his “incredible math skills” he’s super behind on content. So naturally, he had the genius idea of assigning   chapters over break, each chapter containing    -minute lecture videos, accompanied by a   minute timed quiz for each video. He’s just using his old lecture videos to assign to us. 

We got assigned these today, (the day before our break) and they are due November  th (the day we get back) So he’s basically forcing us to teach ourselves the content and spend an ungodly amount of time studying during break. To make matters worse, the exam on these   chapters is also the day we get back from break.

So I’m wondering, is it normal in college for professors to assign this much work during break??? Anyone with similar experiences? And any advice on how to get all of it done? At this point, I’m so stressed out and now I won’t even have a Thanksgiving break. Thanks Professor!


Update: 

Wow, I didn’t expect to be given so much good advice! Thank you all for your concerns and great advice regarding my issue at hand. 

I ended up emailing my professor in order to clarify his work expectations for us over break, and he ended up telling me that there will be only    -minute quizzes, not   as he originally stated. That makes more sense due to my calculations of   chapters, each with   videos and a quiz after each video.

It makes me feel a bit better about the situation, but it’s still a lot of work to be done, and quite frankly, pretty shitty of him to assign over break. As stated above, he is the type of professor that has a very difficult time actually teaching the course, and as a result, gets very distracted, goes on half-hour tangents, and brags about his degree. He also expects us students to often know much more than we actually do, so he gets frustrated when we ask questions. 

If I can take anything positive from this experience, it is that I will finally be able to learn Calculus   in an uninterrupted way. I will be free of his useless tangents and stories, so I can hopefully better prepare for the exam this way, as opposed to his “teaching strategy.”

438,1609694665.0,college,"You pay for college, you should know how it operates.I’m gonna lead off the bat by saying this can be a long post. As someone that works professionally in Higher ed, and as someone who got their masters in student affairs and higher ed have a pretty strong understanding of how universities operate at their core. For you students out there, my plan is to lay a pretty decent foundation here to help you understand many different aspects of how your university probably operates, since you pay for it and are the reason these institutions exist. I’ll say, I’m not the expert on everything or every type of university, and my experience is entirely in the United States so that is who this will be most relevant to, but I’m hoping I can bring some interesting info to you on this Sunday morning! 

First and foremost, universities are businesses at the core. Just like Target, Walmart, or Amazon, they have a bottom line that needs to be met. Your tuition and student fees pay this bottom line, alongside federal and state funding if your institution is public. The more students a university has, the better faculty they can hire, the more research they can pump out, the better alumni they can get who will hopefully donate, and the cycle continues. Your money is being put into a long term investment by the university to sustain itself. The biggest expenditure of any university? Faculty and staff. Let’s break those down. 

Faculty are your professors and researchers who teach courses, contribute to scientific papers, and experts of a given field. Thing is, any bit of discovery or research faculty yield, their intellectual property in other words, belongs to the university. If I were a cancer researcher and made a massive breakthrough in cancer treatment, that belongs to my employer, not me. This is not an exclusive practice to higher ed, but consider how faculty are paid and tenured up front and how it is part of a larger system for an institution to protect their investments. 

Staff are everyone else. These are your custodial staff, dining staff, residence hall employees, student activities peeps, diversity center staff, etc. If the faculty are left brain, staff are right brain. Their job is to keep amenities usable, create safe environments for all on campus, and create learning/social opportunities outside of the lecture hall. I fall into this category. 

Let’s stick with this left brain and right brain analogy. Left brain are your academic affairs team, they are focused on the classroom experience and your enrichment in the field you have specified. Your advisors, faculty and program chairs are gonna work to develop your academic capital.  Your right brain, student affairs, will work to adjust you to being a strong functioning member of a global society, helping you network and meet people you would never normally meet. They’re focused on your social capital. These two parts of the brain are meant to work in tandem, but at many universities they grind up against each other. Some in student affairs view those in academic affairs as pretentious or uncaring. Some in academic affairs see those in student affairs as wasteful or unnecessary. I’m not here to say who is right or wrong, but instead advocate that they need to work together to create the best experience for all. 

Let’s talk about how your money breaks down further: your fees pay for all the above staff and faculty, as well as dining halls, programs on campus, sports and clubs. Sports are seen as big money makers on campus: this isn’t always true! Sure, some very large programs (think Alabama or UT Austin) turn a profit on their sports programs, and usually the profit from these programs go into paying for other sports on campus. Usually though, sports programs break even on their costs or even subsidize the costs across the whole student body. Sports have become their own worst enemy: they need to fill seats and charge fees to sustain themselves lest they fall apart. 

Another important thing to know about your money: it doesn’t always pay for what you think it does. Some departments or offices on campus are auxiliary services. What that means is that they do NOT receive federal funding. Housing is a great example of this. All money that housing uses is *usually* only what is earned by students living in the halls. So your money goes into paying for the maintenance of all buildings, housing staff, programming etc. Parking is another auxiliary service. This is not to defend they high prices of living on campus, but instead to help explain why some of those costs are the way they are. 

One last thing I’ll cover here is power. The head of your university may be titled President, Chancellor, Dean etc. You may believe this person holds all the power on campus: this isn’t necessarily true. Most heads of universities are tasked with two big things: build strong alumni relationships to get more funds, and build strong political connections on behalf of the university. These presidents or chancellors are truly political figures at the core and they have lots of different people in their ears telling them what to do: student governments, faculty and staff associations, alumni, parents, and the biggest of all, board of regents/directors. This board is where lots of power rests. I’d recommend you learn who is on your board and what their backgrounds are: this can help you understand a lot of decisions made on your campus. Ultimately though, the power is in the consumer, and that is the student body. The ability to make changes as students cannot be understated. 


Whew. That is a lot. And it doesn’t even scratch the surface of all that is there. I’m hoping that this helps provide some interesting information of how funds are allocated, how systems operate, and where the power rests in any given institution. As a student who is paying to uphold all these different things, I believe it is your responsibility to know how your money is spent and how you are being advocated for on multiple levels. My career is in supporting students through their higher ed journey and I love it to death. Because I love it so much, I really believe that it is my duty to be honest and transparent with those who pay my salary. Hopefully y’all enjoyed this and finds use in it!",6302,1080,0

My high school experience wasn’t the best because I felt terribly lonely all the time. I hardly had any friends, never went to parties or just out with anyone, didn’t have a boyfriend(still haven’t had one) and being introverted didn’t help the situation either. I missed out on a ton of things and memories because of my self esteem issues and introvertedness. I graduated with one friend I thought would be my life friend but that didn’t work out and I now keep in contact with no one from high school. 

Community college was pretty much the same situation. The first   semesters were great though. I met a lot of cool people but those friendships never lasted. The last   semesters I felt just as lonely as I did in high school.

The uni I'm at has a decent amount of dorm options, but I really wanted to go with the one in the center of campus, which was in high demand due to the location. On room selection day I was lucky enough to get one of the very last rooms available at my desired residence hall. I was matched with a random roommate and thought everything good to go until they messaged me the next day telling me to switch out because the spot in his dorm was meant for his friend.

By now, there are no other rooms available in that residence hall since it was in such high demand, meaning that if I gave up the spot I would have to go to one of the dorms at the edge of campus. I was really looking forward to living in my selected dorm because it's really close to all my classes and I'm almost fully legally blind, meaning biking / driving / skating around isn't an option for me and walking was a super convenient option from where I was (planning on) living. 

Now, though, it seems that I've been given the ultimatum of either being forced to move out to another dorm or live with someone who does not want to live with me. On the housing application sheet, there was a section meant to indicate whether or not you were planning on living with a selected roommate or a random roommate, and this person says something went wrong with their friend's application which is why they weren't automatically paired. I've contacted the university housing department (no response yet) and my assigned roommate is getting pushy about me choosing somewhere else to live.

The Dean of Students Staff is trying to cover it up. They’ve told their RA’s to tell people it was another accident, just like the first time. But do they think we’re stupid? This is the second time in a month. Same bathroom. 

While doing some investigating to catch the staff in their lie, I ran into the Campus Safety officer on duty. He confirmed that it was an arsonist. He told us about the accelerant. He told us that the building did actually catch fire.

I’m terrified to be on this campus now. This is the second time that there has been a fire in a month and no alarms went off. People rarely use that hallway when the fires were set as well.

459,1589996198.0,college,"Tips on how to raise your GPA as an average studentI technically made the dean's list this semester with a GPA of  . . I know for some it may not too high, but as someone who made a post at the end of last semester how to increase my pithy GPA of  . , it has been a good reminder that grades are not an accurate reflection of your self-worth.

This sub has helped me in the past, so I decided to make a post giving some personal suggestions and reflecting on some of the study habits that I adopted this semester.

&#x B;

 . ***Make a planner or calendar*** with all the due dates from the syllabus. Update this as changes arise. I also make a breakdown of grades for each course.
 . ***Grind to score well in your first midterm or major assignments.*** They cover the basic topics in the course that later material builds on. My personal opinion is that it sets the expectations for both how you and the professor believe you are going to perform in the course. Furthermore, they are usually comparatively easier & therefore important for courses in which you can only drop  - % points to score an A.
 . Be that kid that ***speaks up in class***. Clearing up doubts as they arise is very important. You will not remember to look it up later. This will help the professor remember who you are (hint: professors like students that are interested in what they teach!)
 . ***Do the readings when they are assigned.***
 . ***Review what you do after each class***. Summarise by writing down notes or typing out the important points that you have learned in class (each time) using your own notes, lecture slides, book, handouts, and readings.
 . ***Go to*** ***office hours,*** and not just before the exams. Office hours are for you to make use of. Ask your silly questions (if you still too shy to ask in a lecture setting) or ask for clarification on what the assignments are. Very important as soon as you feel like you are struggling. t is as simple as saying, that you feel like you are struggling or not doing well you had hoped.
 . ***Exploit the rubric***. For a majority of the assignments professors layout word-to-word an outline of what they expect from you in the rubric. Follow it!!

I've ran out of a room crying once when everyone looked at me to answer a question in class.
I wanted to change this about myself, so I went into college as a Communication major, marketing minor, joined a marketing club (now on the executive board), and got a job in hospitality and another job in sales. 

I have gotten a lot better EXCEPT for standing in front of an entire room of people looking at me while it's dead silent. Couple examples:

 . Gave a speech about boba tea in front of a class of about   students (could've been worse). Rambled for about   minutes about how a lot of people don't like it because of the sucking balls into your mouth part and the texture. Yea

 . Dad jokes. I wear glasses so I walked into a room to give a pitch and I said ""You know the great thing about being blind as a bat and having social anxiety? I can take my glasses off and it's like none of you are here"" and I took off my glasses and put them on the table and proceeded with my pitch.

It is now very much the norm for students to bring their laptops to class to take notes. I am fine with that and allow it as do a vast majority of my colleagues. But please know that it is very obvious to your instructor when you are doing something other than taking notes. You might be online, messaging a friend, playing a game, or doing whatever one might do with an open laptop; we know. You might ask 'how do you know?' There are many signs. Maybe I am not talking for a minute while a student speaks but you are frantically typing away. Maybe I am discussing something rather mundane and you keep looking at your laptop and smiling. Maybe I cold call on you and you have no idea what we are discussing. Maybe it is because you have not looked up from your screen for   straight minutes.

It is possible that you do not care that we know but you should. Because when you bomb an assignment and come running to me for leniency I will remember. When you email me asking for clarification on something I discussed at length while you were distracted I'll have to decide how quickly to respond to that email. I'm not a dick, I am very student-centered but respect is a two way street and if you show me none I am hard pressed to want to show you any.

471,1608677416.0,college,"In the CARES Act, colleges and universities received $  Billion in Covid-  Aid. In this second stimulus package, they're receiving $  billion. My question is: where is that money going to end up?After doing some research, it seems that the $  billion, similar to the $  billion, is being earmarked for the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF). But, does anyone know how these funds will be used exactly, and will it be similar to the March relief?

**EDIT:**

I think I found the allocation scheme. It's starts on line   on page   of the bill which is titled ""HIGHER  EDUCATION  EMERGENCY  RELIEF  FUND""

Specifically on line   of page  , it states how the universities may use the funds allocated to them.

Here is the excerpt:

**USES  OF FUNDS —An  institution  of  higher  education  receiving  funds  under  this  section  may  use  the  funds received to**

>**( )  defray  expenses  associated  with  coronavirus (including  lost  revenue,  reimbursement  for  expenses already  incurred,  technology  costs  associated  with  a transition  to  distance  education,  faculty  and  staff  trainings, and payroll);**  
>  
>**( )  carry  out  student  support  activities  authorized   by   the   HEA   that   address   needs   related   to   coronavirus;**  
>  
>**( )  provide  financial  aid  grants  to  students  (including  students  exclusively  enrolled  in  distance  education), which may be used for any component of the student’s  cost  of  attendance  or  for  emergency  costs that  arise  due  to  coronavirus,  such  as  tuition,  food,  housing,  health  care  (including  mental  health  care),  or  child  care.  In  making  financial  aid  grants  to  students,   an   institution   of   higher   education   shall   prioritize  grants  to  students  with  exceptional  need, such as students who receive Pell Grants.**

EDIT  :

I think I found the provision that dictates the amount higher institutions are required to give as financial aid to students.  It's starts on line   of page  . It states the following:

>**( )  Institutions  of  higher  education  receiving  allocations  under   section   (a)( )  of  this  title  shall  provide  at  least  the   same  amount  of  funding  in  emergency  financial  aid  grants  to   students  as  was  required  to  be  provided  under  sections    (a)( )  and (c) of division B of the CARES Act (Public Law   – ).**  An  institution  of  higher  education  that  repurposes  funds  pursuant  to  paragraph  ( )  **shall  ensure  that  not  less  than     percent  of  the  funds  received under section  (a)( ) of division B of the CARES  Act  (Public  Law   – )  are  used  for  financial  aid  grants  to  students**  under  either  section   (c)  of  division  B  of  the  CARES  Act  or  section   (c)( )  of  this  title,  or  a  combination  of  those  sections:

&#x B;

So, it seems that the students that received payments in March from their university will also be receiving it this time around, as well. However, I'm not sure if more students are going to be included in these payments. Given that there's going to be almost $  Billion dollars more in funding this time, it would only make sense that either more students receive money or the students that received money last time will get more, but nothing has made sense this year, so I wouldn't bet on this making sense either.

I may be missing something here, so if one of y'all find better info, please don't hesitate to correct me. It'll help all of us get a better picture of what's going on.

Most schools have formal review surveys called “Professor Evaluations” that they ask folks to do at the mid term and the end of the semester.

I had never been in communal showers before, so I didn't know about Athlete's foot or whatever it was.

Ever since moving on campus I really just feel an urge to talk to people. Especially since i’m a freshman in a new place and I don’t know anyone, I really wanted to make some friends quickly. 

On the second (first full) day here after move-in, I was in the lobby of my residence hall and saw a big group of students walking past. I said hey and asked where they were going (they said Walgreens), decided to come along, and next thing I know i’m added into their group chat and we’re having dinner together downtown. 

Even since then, I’ve been the one talking first to people in my classes and making more friends to add to the group chat. Now there’s like   of us! 

I’ve always wanted a big friend group like this, but was never able to have it since I was so shy. Not sure what happened inside of me to change this drastically, but I am really thankful for it.

“Oh, that’s cute” (what the hell?)

“I’ve heard ed majors skip class a lot. Is that true?” (I go to class, thanks for asking)

“I’m (engineering/pre-med/etc) so I’m taking a lot of science and math classes you don’t have to take.” (Good for you, I guess? I don’t really believe that more difficult classes make a major superior to others, so I guess I just don’t really get the point to this one)

“Do you ever feel like you’re selling yourself short?” (No.)

“Wouldn’t you rather be a child psychologist/social worker/lawyer?” (I think for some reason the fact that I’m *not* jumping straight from undergrad to grad school makes a lot of people uncomfortable. That’s really not my problem, sorry)

EDIT: I just remembered a bonus one: “you should try to get into a private school! Public school teachers make so little money!” Fun fact: public school teachers tend to make more money than private school teachers. As a general rule, it’s not a good idea to give advice when you don’t know what you’re talking about.

What to do when your professor asks questions on quizzes and exams that they never went over in lecture? 

This is an ongoing thing with all of her exams and quizzes, and she offers no extra credit for the class. 

Example: we learned in class that cooking cast iron increases iron absorption.

On the quiz: what increases iron absorption? 

The answer: cooking in cast iron and using acidic sauces.

Not once did she mention acidic sauces in class and there is no way this is a critical thinking Q with what she’s taught. 

This isn’t the only example I have but she locks the exams so I can’t go look back at the specific questions. I am trying to remember the Q better now that I know she has answers she never taught. 

Another ex of how she asks questions: infants need   essential amino acids, adults need    (learned in lecture)

Question: how many amino acids do adults and infants need? (I remember this Q specifically bc I had to think it through)

I answered  , she said the answer was  (when I asked what I got wrong). I feel like this was a trick question?? Because both need  , not  . 

I emailed her about it and she didn’t respond. I looked up her rate my professor and this is a common theme in this class and her more advanced class too (I will be paying $$$ to take the class anywhere else than with her next semester). She asks things she never discussed in lecture and sometimes the questions/answers are wrong. 

With the recent Q on cast iron, I asked for credit for the answer I gave because she never went over acidic sauces in class. 

Exact message: “Cooking with acidic sauces was not taught in class lecture and there is no mention of it in the notes. Is there a way I could please receive credit for this question? I went back and re-watched the lectures as well as looking through my notes thoroughly and there is no mention of cooking with acidic sauces.

533,1596397339.0,college,"To help people who are wondering how much stuff they need to bring for college, here’s some guidance.I was a transfer student, so I’ve lived in the dorms at multiple different schools. I’m generally a bit of a pack rat, so I’ve developed a minimalist approach to packing for college in order to keep clutter at bay. This minimalist approach is especially important this semester, since you might end up having to leave with short notice due to the pandemic. Here’s some advice:

(Note: I am a girl, guys might pack a bit differently, but I think most of this advice is gender-neutral)

Clothes:
- only bring clothes that are appropriate for the climate and season where your school is. Think to yourself, “will I realistically need this clothing item between now and the next time I come home?” If not, don’t bring it. 

- only bring two week’s worth of clothes. This will keep clothing clutter to a minimum and motivate you to do laundry regularly so you don’t have dirty clothes everywhere. 

- Most of your clothes should be casual and comfortable, but you should have one “going out” outfit (you shouldn’t be going to parties this semester, but you might want to dress up if you have a date or something) and at least one professional-looking outfit for if you have a job interview or presentation. 

- maximum   pairs of shoes. Any more than that will be difficult to find space for in your little dorm closet, and will take up a ton of space in your luggage. You will be walking around a lot more than you did in high school, so plan your shoe choices accordingly. Function over fashion. 

Decor:

- This semester I’m actually not bringing any decor at all. I know it sounds depressing, but a lack of decor will make it much easier to pack everything up if I end up having to leave. Under normal circumstances, though, I recommend photos, posters, and string lights or garlands. 

- DO NOT BRING ANYTHING that takes up space on a horizontal surface. Your desk is small, and you will need it for your school supplies, papers, and as a space for eating and/or doing makeup. You will regret bringing anything non-functional that takes up space on your desk or other flat surface. If you want to decorate, use your walls!

- I wouldn’t recommend bringing a tapestry. My roommate had two of them and they were constantly falling down because dorm-friendly wall adhesives (i.e. adhesives that won’t damage the wall) aren’t strong enough for tapestries. 

- Some dorms have really crappy lighting. In my first dorm, the light was so dim it was essentially useless. I ended up buying an LED floor lamp to solve this problem. If you don’t know what the lighting will be like, wait until after you move in and then buy a floor lamp from a local store if it ends up being necessary. 

- If you ever do makeup, bring a desktop mirror so you can do your makeup at your desk. Your roommates/floormates might get annoyed if you’re constantly using the bathroom sink mirror for applying makeup. 

Other things:

- Don’t bring too many dishes. One or two of each item is good. Plus, some items can serve double-duty! For example, I didn’t have a bowl and whenever I wanted soup or something, I ate out of my coffee mug. Make sure to bring dish soap, a sponge, and a dish towel so you can wash your dishes in the sink. Your dorm probably won’t have a dishwasher. 

- Only bring the hair care stuff you actually use. My mom told me to bring a hairdryer, but I hate blow-drying my hair, so that hairdryer was a total waste of space. You know yourself best. Bring the stuff you know you will use, leave behind the stuff you probably won’t use. The same applies for makeup and jewelry. 

- Bring cleaning supplies to keep your room hygienic. If you have a bathroom in your dorm room, you and your roommate(s) will be responsible for cleaning it, so bring bathroom cleaning supplies. If you have a communal bathroom though, you will not be responsible for cleaning it. 

- For school supplies, bring the stuff that works best for you. If you prefer using pens instead of pencils for note-taking, bring lots of pens and only a couple pencils. If you love organizing with folders but you hate  -ring binders, don’t bring binders. You are the boss of your organization system in college. There is no school supply list. Pick the supplies that have previously worked well for you, and leave the ones you’ve always hated behind. 

- Even after using these less-is-more tricks, you might still feel like you have too much stuff. At that point, you probably don’t have too much stuff. 

Hope this helps! Feel free to add your own tips in the comments.

Edit: One last thing... if you end up needing something that you didn’t bring, you can pick it up from home on your next trip back or order it online. Sometimes it’s actually better to underpack than to overpack. You might be surprised how much you don’t actually need.",4898,877,0

536,1595878735.0,college,"UPDATE: Prof has COVID and disappeared after the first week of class...Some of you asked so here it is .... the big update!

First - if you end up in a situation as I did in my [original post]( this may be helpful info. Maybe not. 

So my professor ended up contracting COVID-  and disappeared. With about   weeks left in our accelerated  -week summer course, Prof slowly started coming back online. We ended up dropping a lot of labs and quizzes altogether from the syllabus and focused on the important shit. Also, prof made it clear he would be generous with grades since we were left to our own defenses to learn   chapters. We wrapped up on time and I got a solid A so I was happy to just wait for the prof to come back in the end. However, I did not learn what I would have had we had a normal class and so that is a little concerning. I am following up with the second part of this subject in the fall ( I took class A  and now need to take class A ) so I may struggle but only time will tell. Prof did video lectures remainder of class - even being clearly sick he made a solid effort, and I really appreciate that. I thought he was strange for using a cell phone but turns out he was teaching from a hospital while in isolation - which is crazy and I have no idea how Prof did that but they did. 

So here is my advice to any student who ends up in a similar situation. First, start reading the textbook and plan on teaching yourself - while making sure to follow the schedule unless it changes. Message your classmates (even if its  % online and you don't know them personally), because odds are they have the same questions and will respond to you asap). If you get to the point where you haven't heard anything in over a week first email the Prof, then if no response then email your advisement consular who can help too. If all fails come back here and let us know because we have a LOT of awesome people in this sub that have really good advice. 

Life happens. Stay committed and on task. and this too shall pass.

No one dares to admit it, but college students are awful about abandoning animals. Many students graduate and move to new places that don't take animals so they ""just so happen"" to lose their animals and leave their cats and dogs behind as strays, especially cats.

If you live in your college town during the summer, you may notice that many stray cats pop up immediately after graduation or when leases tend to end. It's also seen somewhat in the shelters, too.

I just took a final in a class that up to the final I was near the top of the class of, I was one of the only students that could answer questions the professor asked and did significantly better on open-ended quizzes. It's a very difficult class so I spent over   days and probably  -  hours studying for the final, reading the textbook, memorizing vocab, etc. Also for context, this class is a lecture class with hundreds of students.

The day of the final came and on the multiple choice section I got a  / , so a  %.

548,1565663878.0,college,"Dear Incoming Freshmen,As the summer is winding down and you are getting ready to leave home and go off to your college of choice (if you haven’t already), this post is for you. 

Leaving for college is both a liberating and terrifying experience. You leave everything that you’ve ever known to go to this place to peruse a better life for yourself. While there is much honor in doing this, there is no doubt that you feel scared to leave the comfort of your parents home and the life that you have become accustomed to. You will be leaving your parents and your home (for those of you not commuting), your friends, your pets, your room, etc. You go to this new place with no idea what to expect and not knowing many people. Many college students have gone through this. 

As a sophomore, I will admit that I do not know everything that there is to no know about going away to college. However, I can say that I can offer pieces of advice. 

Going away to college is a big deal. It is a major transitional period in your life. Your parents know this, your professors know this. That being said, in your freshman year, professors and school officials do tend to be more lenient toward freshman because they are adjusting to the new lifestyle of living away from home and on their own. 

Once you move in to your new dorm, the reality of the situation will not begin to set in until your parents leave (If they helped you move in. I know that some kids drive themselves). Once they leave, take some time to unpack and organize your things. Then maybe take a walk around campus, either by yourself or with a roommate, to familiarize yourself with your surroundings and the layout of the campus. 

Don’t try to join too many clubs or organizations because if you do what I did, you try to sign up for as many things as possible. Please take into consideration that you are acclimating to this new lifestyle and don’t try to overwhelm yourself with unnecessary activities. You also need to make time to do everything, such as study and do your laundry. More power to those that can handle it all though.

Remember to be respectful of your roommate. You will share a room and maybe a bathroom with this person for the whole year. It is better to be at a good understanding of each other’s boundaries then to deal with the fallout from not doing so later. Also remember to set up those boundaries earlier. Your RAs will most likely encourage this. An RA told me something that I will never forget and its that you will not always be best friends with your roommate, sometimes you are just simply that; roommates. 

Keep your classes and classwork organized. You will save so much time not having to dig through piles of paper to find one assignment. Personally, I use separate binders for each class but that’s just me. 

Figure out a good sleep schedule that works for you and stick to it. Don’t wake up at staggered times and go to bed at staggered times. There were countless times that I would have an  pm class as my first one that day and sleep until  :  and then not want to go to bed until   or   the following night before I had an  am the next day. Sleep is more important than you think.

Always print things out in advance. You don’t want printer problems to screw you over   minutes before you have to turn it in. Print it out ASAP to save yourself some stress. 

Never feel pressured into partying. If you want to go to a party, then by all means go. If it is not your thing, then don’t go. Just make sure that it will not be an inconvenience to your schoolwork. It is okay to say no to going to a party. I know many, many people that made partying their first priority and they dropped out by the start of the second semester. It’s important to have a good balance between fun and work. 

Go to class!! Just go. You don’t want to miss one and be out of the loop and have no idea what’s going on. If you have to miss one because you are sick or there are family issues going on, email your teacher or ask classmates to catch you up, maybe even bring you a copy of class work. You have unlimited resources to keep you caught up. 

In regard to the above paragraph, you are allotted a certain amount of classes that you can miss before you fail. Do not abuse these because I guarantee you that there will come a day where you really wish that you had a freebie to use but you used them all in the first two months. Just keep a couple in the reserves and use them wisely. 

And last but not least, do what YOU want to do. Do what makes YOU happy and what you feel is best for yourself. Don’t do things you don’t want to do because your friends are doing them. Don’t do something that you don’t want to do because your parents are forcing you to. Do what makes YOU happy. And while you may feel pressured from all sides to do things that don’t make you happy, in the end is that really a way to live your life? Constantly bending over backwards for something you don’t like? Be yourself. Do what you love. Be happy. College only lasts for so long so enjoy the time that you have there. 

Sincerely, 
Your neighborhood sophomore

Just curious if anyone has experienced anything similar, and if so, what was the outcome (though I hope no one else has been here). 

So, I *graduated* in spring. I was accepted to a grad program, moved across the country, and have been taking GRAD classes/working/conducting research all summer. 

I received an email this afternoon from my UG uni stating that I could apply for readmission and graduation, if I wanted to graduate in December. 

Say what?! 

It turns out, I had an incomplete (thanks to Covid) THAT WAS NEVER CHANGED. Mind you, this was a research course that was an elective (didn’t need it to graduate). The instructor turned in the grade after the deadline. 

Again, say what?!

Before finding out that a degree wasn’t granted, I contacted the uni asking why I haven’t received my diploma yet. They mentioned they were backordered and I wouldn’t receive until the end of summer. NEVER did anyone mention that I wouldn’t be awarded a degree.  

It’s likely my grad school won’t mind at all, and I’ll continue on like nothing happened, but my mind is blown right now. And I know the pandemic has really hit academia hard, but shit. Can’t a girl even graduate?!

You may remember me from a post from a few months ago, called “my roommate is about to make me fail my exams.”

I realized i forgot to update that post: basically my RA had a talk with us, which pissed my roommate off even MORE, and she started doing more microaggressions towards me. Now she likes to play her shows out loud all night and screams at me when I try to turn the lights off. I invested in a blackout eye mask and ear plugs, which have greatly helped. I was also told nothing much can be done, as she absolutely refuses to move, and I can’t move my stuff to any of the other dorms available, they’re all across campus and no one I know has a car.

I’ve been spending less and less time in the room and for some reason it’s pissing her off so badly. I was gonna just stick it out for the rest of the year, until today, when she locked me out of the room after a shower. I don’t bring my keys to the shower as she’s usually in there with the door unlocked, and I usually bring undergarments and a robe but no towels, as our room is directly across from the bathroom. I don’t think I’ve ever gotten so mad at someone in my life, nor do I think I’ve ever screamed that much in my life. She flat out told me that she hoped I got assaulted so I wouldn’t spend so much time out of the room.

582,1695888804.0,college,"HELP: My brother deleted four years of workI'm   and in my final quarter of college. About   and a half years ago, I got an iPad to start taking notes. I love it, both for the convenience of carrying one thing and for the organization it gives. A lot of my course material overlaps, so it makes it easier to have the notes in one place. I plan to go to grad school, so it'll be nice to reference them later should I need refreshers.

However, it goes to sh\*t when it comes to my brother. I love him, but he likes to play around on my devices (he has his own device, he just likes to use mine for whatever reason). Usually, he'll just look through photos or play music, but on a few occasions, I've left my iPad with the goodnotes app open. He thinks its a game and will scribble/erase all over them before I get the make a copy. Unfortunately, Goodnotes doesn't have a revision history feature so usually I'll just have to redo everything.

If I get mad or try to explain, it'll stick for a few minutes but it never stays. He's severely autistic, so he genuinely does not know any better. All he understands is that I'm mad at him or that he did something wrong, so he just cries. Then all I can do is hug him, point to the iPad, and shake my head ""No touching."" He'll understand for a minute, but he's incredibly OCD when it comes to his routine. So the next day he'll repeat the cycle, he just goes back to playing with my devices. I've updated his own device to have everything mine does, but he still uses my device.

After he deleted notes the night before a midterm (I went to go get a snack), I broke down. I completely changed the passcode and added a finger ID.

While I was out getting groceries, he security locked the shit. Everything online tells me I need to reset it to factory settings, but I don't know how many notes I've actually saved. So I don't want to reset it and delete everything. Also, it's been a while since I've updated the software so I'm unsure if that's up to date.

I don't know what to do. If there's a way to bypass the security access and open it so I can back it up, please let me know. If not, is there a way where I can make good notes require a PIN code to access it every time I open the app? That way he can still play on it, but my notes will still be safe? Or a way to disable the ""too many attempted failures"" feature?

It's really shitty I got to do this in the first place, but I don't know what else I can do. As much as he drives me up the wall, I still love my brother. So I got to work around it I guess

It’s my first year as an RA and I’ve had trouble with many people in my building but nothing like this night. So to begin the story i had been hanging out on another floor in another RAs room. I’m on duty this night because it’s my usual duty night. So as I’m hanging out with the other RA in their room I hear a loud noice in the hallway and I come out to see what’s going on? As I leave out I see this guy with a whole mattress he had stolen from another room walking down the hallway. When he gets back to his room he slams the door and begins screaming at himself. He’s clearly drunk and can’t comprehend what’s going on. So me and another RA attempt to get him to take the mattress back and and go sleep the alcohol off. Eventually we get him to take the mattress back to the room it came from. Now he’s walking down the hallways trying to hug us to try and I guess make things right. He suddenly spots a random kid on his ways back to his room and attempts to punch him. We stop him and call the cops who come and give him a citation. He’s begging and pleading with the cops asking why this has to happen but the still give him the citation and tell him to go to bed because if they have to come back he’s going to jail. So he goes in his room for   minutes before coming back out and hurling insults at one RA. He then goes back to his room and slams his door so hard the lock breaks.

My dorm room isn't particularly bad or anything, but no matter what I do it just doesn't feel like home.  A common answer when I looked up this was just to decorate and stuff and even when I do that I still hate it.  Even among posters and lights and rugs, it's still a very very barebones room.

Part of it is definitely that it doesn't really feel like there's a clear separation between school and living.  Like even after all my stuff is done I still live at my college which means it's hard to really feel like I get a break.  Also, the dorms, at least at my uni, are all quite loud and filled with hordes of partying freshmen.  It legitimately feels like I'm living at the zoo with how hectic it is, and compared to off-campus apartments/houses that I've visited, it's way more severe in a dorm.

594,1566577453.0,college,"A Former Student’s Top Tips for CollegeAs a recent graduate and with many people starting college on Monday, I thought I would pass on some tips that helped me throughout my studies. These are some tips I really haven’t seen mentioned before and although some of these tips may not be applicable to everyone, they sure helped me out. 

 . Network as many people as you can to and go out of your way to help people. 

I would say I talked to about  % of the people in my classes (about class size of  ) and got to know about   people from each class really well. When I had a question about homework I always had someone to ask and when people asked me a question I tried my best to answer. I would even used my tablet to make a step by step example to help them understand the topic better. When I graduated I got multiple jobs interviews/offers because people knew the type of person I was and recommended me for the job at the company they worked for. 

 . Talk to your professors and show them what type of student your are. 

Put in the extra effort into studying for your tests and completing your projects. Spend that extra time in creating your presentation and attempting to have the best results for the project possible. Let me tell you professors recognize this and when they need someone to help with their research they may turn to you. I had a couple of professors approach me during my senior year offering me a job working for them along with PAYING FOR MY MASTERS DEGREE. I know this may not be true for some majors but for some it is. 

 . Learn to read PDFs on your computer. 

I didn’t buy a college text book in   of the   years I was in college (sophomore year throughout my masters) because I either found PDFs online or was given them by other students (this is where networking and going out of your way to help others comes back around). The last book I bought was a chemistry book and the only reason I bought that was because I had to have the online access code (such a rip off). Some of the books were the previous edition but the information in them was still  % the same. The only thing that was altered was the example and homework problems. 

 . Make a study guide that summarizes all of the important topics with worked out example problems for every course relative to your major. 

Right before every test I made a short summary guide of every major topic that would be on that test along with a few worked out examples. Many of my courses called for knowledge from a previous course and I used this study guide to quickly/ easily remember those topics. I also used this guide to study for my job interviews. You will be thankful for this when the person interviewing you makes you solve problems on the white board 

 . Find out where your department staff is and always be friendly with them. 

Over the first two years I got to know the office staff of my department and every time they had leftover food from meetings they would let me know. I got a free lunch one to three times a week from this. 


I hope this helps you out some and if you would like me to further explain just let me know!


Edit: Many people are asking me through on and commenting about how to network. I was/am an extremely introverted person that enjoys being alone at times. To show how introverted I am here is a story: I didn’t like talking to people so much that in my first semester I would eat my lunch in my truck. Well one day a guy from my calculus class saw me and came to my truck and started talking to me. The day after he found me again and did the same thing. The third day I park in the parking lot across campus so I could eat lunch alone again. Fast forward   years and I actually have a great job because of this guy.

So here is how I did it.  At the start of my sophomore year I started small by sitting in the front row next to people that were actually engaged in the class and I would ask them how their weekend was or how their other classes were going. After I got to know them the first couple of weeks I would ask them if they would like to stay after to work on the homework or study for the test. Then I would invite them to go to lunch or dinner. I found a common interest with some of them and did that with them. This is a long story but in summary one guy and I played ping pong in the rec every Tuesday my junior year.  He became one of my best college friends and we now talk every week even though he is   states away. Also when you are in group projects pull you weight and step up. People remember this and will want to work with you again. This is how I began to network. I hope this helps some.",4651,896,0

People always tell me that I'm worthless, a clown, an idiot because I'm not studying something STEM.

I have a learning disability that basically blocks me from studying anything STEM, because of the numbers, equations, calculus, etc.

I can't do anything about it, even though I'd tried very hard. I went to private tutors, always showed up to class, always did my homework, and tried to solve Maths problems in my free time. But absolutely nothing worked...

I got into a prestigious university, and into a hard Humanities program that I love. But every time I talk about that something's hard, people invalidate me because it's not STEM.

I don't even feel like a progressive young adult woman, because I'm not studying natural sciences.

I absolutely despise myself for it, and people still throw sh*t at me for it.

And he said that he hates masks and if my college didn't require it, he'd snatch it off! He also proceeded to say that the USA has done more for the environment than any other country. He kept sprinkling in his conservative politics to all of the things he discussed. It drove me nuts. 

Also, on the ""optional reading"" page on Moodle, there's an article about socialism being bad. He's a soil science professor! Why is it necessary to put all of your political convictions (which are bigoted and dangerous in this era of COVID) out in the open? This is going to be a fun semester.

UPDATE: I filed a complaint to the dean's office yesterday. Today when I went into class, he used the plexiglass protector and did not complain about the mask at all.

617,1599309698.0,college,"To those wondering what it is like to go to a university THAT HAS NOT SHUT DOWNLet me start by saying  I have yet to get sick, but I have had to move locations the past month due to people around me becoming infected.

For sake of anonymity, I will not disclose my school directly. I will say I attend a college in Virginia that is currently getting hit hard with rona, and is a hot spot zone.  The most common thing I have seen people blame is that it’s people partying. Yes that is a factor but I will list all the things I have seen on campus.

 ) No mask enforcement, even though they market that they are mandated on campus.
  You can walk on campus and  if people do not have masks on, they are wearing them incorrectly. I witnessed a girl with a mask below her nose ,sneeze and not cover her nose.

 ) Buildings do not enforce policies
   I worked in a public area on campus and many  times students would overcrowd elevators, take off masks before they left the building, and come when they were sick. 

 ) staff and professors did not follow procedures 
Students are not the only one to blame. I would say that as many students that were not following procedures, staff and faculty were not either. On my first day back, a professor and student stood in-front of the library door talking less than   feet apart ( no masks on) and you literally had to go in between them to get into the building.

 ) The administration has their head in the sand
 While you notice everything wrong on campus you will continue to get  emails saying how great everything is. In a recent email , our president said that this outbreak was expected and it is coming to a head. They also said we have no evidence of community transmission on campus(blaming off campus students), even though positive COVID cases make up  /  of the county positive results.

 ) Not enough testing is being done
 Our university has a COVID dashboard and anyone with basic understanding of statistics will see how skewed the data is. They only tested kids coming from hot spots and just recently have held mass testing for willing individuals. They only update the information once a week. I was tested on a Friday and did not receive my results until that next Thursday, a day AFTER the university updated their weekly stats.(may just be a conspiracy I have).

 ) You can do everything right but it doesn’t matter if those around you aren’t.
I live with a roommate who doesn’t take COVID seriously. They think because they are young and “ Never get sick”, they shouldn’t worry. I did everything right and because others don’t take it as seriously, you will be affected.

 ) Faculty are struggling 
Professors are having a hard time teaching in this environment. I am very close with one of my professors and they relayed to me how stressful all this has been, especially being an older population and having vulnerable parents at home.

At this point I don’t know if we will shut down. I think it will take everyone overloading the isolation dorms or someone dying. The administration is full steam ahead...",3074,553,0

663,1638319810.0,college,"EXAM TAKING TIPS (take 'em or leave 'em)Prof here -- I don't know how helpful this will be, but I thought I'd give a few tips for folks that are nervous about taking finals for the first time.

Just like my other advice, this is science-based.  Because all that feel-good vibes stuff drives me nuts. 

** .)  IF YOU HAVE TO ""CRAM"" DON'T DO IT THE NIGHT BEFORE.**   For instance, if you have only   days to study, breaking it into   hours per day per subject is way better than doing   straight hours the night before.

** .) ANKI IS YOUR FRIEND.**  Make the cards now, it's a fantastic way to memorize --but if you don't understand your flashcards, don't bother.  This is a memorizing thing (great for languages or formulas)  [

** .) MEMORY DEVICES:**

You might have heard of **PEMDAS** (P*arentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction*) make a word out of first letters.  If it doesn't make a word, make a sentence like...

  ""**K**eep **P**ots **C**lean, **O**r **F**amily **G**ets **S**ick"" for the taxonomy order of *Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species""* or if you're a scuba diver ""**B**ruce **W**illis **R**uins **A**ll **F**ilms"" for *""BCD, Weights, Releases, Final Check""*

** .) CALMING DOWN:**   Here's something I learned from freediving.  If you find yourself going into a major panic, you need to lower your heart rate.  You need to get it as slow as you can.  Now, a lot of folks achieve that through yoga/meditation.  I can't do that.  It just doesn't work for me.  It's too slow and I'm too distracted.  So I had to learn the scientifically proven heart rate lowering hack:

 ) Exhale for the count of  ... (this is hard).  A full slow count of  , so almost a full   seconds.  Not a fast  , but  ... ... ... ... ... ... ...  

 ) Hold breath for   seconds

    ) Inhale deeply for   seconds

    ) Hold breath for   seconds

Repeat starting at one.  If you don't believe it works, read this article about how some freediver's breathing can allow them to lower their heartbeat to the point where they can stay underwater for   minutes.  [  They do it using the breathing exercise, then going into deep cold water (which has to do with the mammalian dive reflex which you can't do unless your exam is underwater.)  

** .) GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP:**   *Tell your roommate to shut the fuck up.*  A good night's sleep is CRITICAL.   This is another reason you shouldn't cram the night before.  Your brain actually absorbs some stuff during sleep.  

** .) SKIM THE EXAM BEFORE YOU START ANSWERING QUESTIONS:**  I always suggest this to students, and then some of them don't take it.   So what happens?  They spend a half-hour working on a question they don't really know the answer to, and then run out of time -- and they aren't able to get to the questions that they absolutely do know the answers to.  Answer the questions you can ace FIRST. Then go back and tackle the others.

** .) WAKE UP EARLY.**  Rushing to class gets your heart rate up.  When your heart rate is up, you are more likely to panic.  When you panic, you are more likely to second guess yourself and more likely to make a mistake.  (again, ask any scuba diver.)

** .) EAT BREAKFAST IF YOU USUALLY EAT BREAKFAST.**   I know some people who just can't eat breakfast early.   But you don't want to be hungry during an exam.

** .) ONLY USE STUDY GROUPS WITH PEOPLE WHO GIVE A SHIT.**   I remember this from when I was in college.  We'd schedule ""study groups"" and do nothing but eat pizza and bitch about classes.  That was only until I did a study group with a roommate that was pre-med.  We were studying totally different things, but she'd give me flashcards, and I'd ask her questions, then I'd give her my flashcards and she'd ask me questions.   What really worked about that was that if I tried to give some bullshit explanation on one of my computer science answers she'd have no idea what I was talking about and would say... I don't know if that's the same as what's on here.   Ditto with her pre-med questions.  If she wasn't able to explain the answer in a clear way that I could understand as a non-premed student she knew she needed to work on it.   But with some of my friends, it wasn't so much of a study group as it was a pizza party with textbooks open.  

** .) READ THE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS!   READ THE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS!   READ THE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS!   READ THEM BACKWARDS IF YOU HAVE TO!**    I can't tell you how many of my really good students lose points because they didn't read carefully.   And they aren't trick questions!   I'll write something like ""Give two examples of scene transitions that do X"" and they'll list one.   The reason?  They just saw ""Give... transition.... do X"".   And boom - they lose   points on a   point question.

**FINALLY -- IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.**  This exam does not determine whether or not you get cancer.  It is not worth beating yourself up for.  Work your hardest to pass it, but if you can't -- I promise you that it's not the end of the world.  You're not a bad person because you failed an exam.  You're not going to get disowned. I promise that you're going to be okay.   Your career is a marathon -- if you slow down and don't do great on one mile, that's fine.  You've got   other miles to prove you're a hard worker.",5323,944,0

Thanks for the advice everyone. 

Basically I didn't read between the lines about the attendance policy and should have known that ""best possible steps to take"" means that she could fail me... Also I should have gone and talked to her after the  th absence, but I didn't.

So what I'm going to do now is try and hold out until Dec   and prioritize getting to this class... 

&#x B;

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Original post:

I already talked with the prof about this. Prof does not grade attendance. Prof says ""if you don’t come to class (from now on), an F will be the only possible grade, unless you decide to withdraw. To my mind, a student who, at the beginning of October has   absences, has missed too many classes.""  is probably too many, and I thought Prof graded attendance and was going to take the low grade for that... Attendance is still kept in record and I have a  % but it doesn't actually count toward the final grade.

Even though I still have SOME attendance, prof said my work is ""excellent,"" AND I have an A in all assignments and tests/quizzes, prof says they will fail me... :)

ALSO university policy says I should attend class but that it is up to the prof to decide policy and it should be on the syllabus (which it was not...) Only thing on the syllabus about attendance was "" Students are allowed four absences during the semester. If students will miss more than four classes, the students have to report to the teacher as soon as possible to discuss the best steps to take to move forward."" and no grade penalties were ever mentioned.

Also the reason I don't go and am willing to take the fall is because I am a HS senior trying to balance work, school,   college classes, one HS class, and social life... I also struggle w/ depression and anxiety and most days I can't afford to drain my battery on a lecture that I don't need.

Basically what do I do to fix it and is it fixable? I don't want to escalate.

&#x B;

EDIT:

So these are not my first college classes... again I was prepared to take the zero grade for attendance (but it was my bad bc she doesn't actually grade attendance when I thought she did)

&#x B;

I have done this in all of my other college courses and I have As in the rest of my classes too...

&#x B;

I know   absences is too many and the prof reserves the right to say that its too many... The problem is the penalty which I was not made aware of and the fact that prof says they ""don't grade attendance"" when attendance apparently does directly impact my grades for assignments the rest of the semester.

I keep up with all slideshows and course content and I am not struggling to produce work. I mentioned I am in HS because I have one morning class at my HS that is at the same time as this class so I don't come all the time bc of that too.... I'm just wondering how I should talk to prof and what to do so I can continue doing the work & get the grades I earn without an automatic fail bc of low attendance.

Full-time semesters are HELL for me, and I recently changed majors from nursing to software engineering. The only way I can get out of college on time is if I tackle full-time semesters instead of just two courses, but how on earth are people surviving  + credits when they're dealing with calculus and upper level programming/engineering classes?? How do you manage to not fail taking these overwhelming classes all at once?

At another uni I was planning to go to (but did not because aforementioned uni accepted me), they had a session for those who'd been accepted to that major, and when I told the other students I was from community college, their jaws quite literally dropped and they were like ""Ur FrOm CoMmUnIty CoLlEge???"" and everything. Like...isn't it good to save money? Good thing I'm not going to that uni!

Since my uni requires a full-time semester GPA at the uni before applying to my major's actual program, I haven't gotten an Associate's yet (am one semester away from doing so, plan to finish it if I get rejected from my major's actual program). So just a bunch of credits from my cc.

On my first day of class this past week I had my Microbiology professor say some things I consider to be really unprofessional.  
  
First, as he begins his introduction he pauses to ask me and another student (we are seated in the front row) if it was okay if he didn't have his mask on while he was in the front of the class (which is JUST barely   feet away). He said he already cleared it with the Administration and as long as we were okay with it they would allow it.  
  
Then he goes into a spiel about how masks are pointless because they don't work; virus' are too small to be blocked by masks. When I questioned him on why would they mandate it if it didn't work he went into it about how Fauci is an idiot who was out of touch with reality and hasn't worked as a clinician since his residency many years ago.  
  
He also mentioned he got COVID-  last January though I find that odd because I don't even think they were testing for COVID-  at that point last year in the US.  
  
He then ends it with saying the only way to get over this mess that is COVID is herd immunity.  
  
Of course it's my fault for not speaking up right away, I just found it hard to when the whole class agreed immediately. I have a bit of social anxiety.

Obviously there are also great professors but they are few and far between at least in my major. I only have two teachers this semester that seem like they’re trying to teach something and are willing to talk to me outside of class. It’s just a struggle having to go through a bunch of extra nonsense and deal with weird teachers on power trips to get a degree.

This was no issue for most of my professors except for one. Of course, it was the professor teaching the fully online elective course.

This might be silly, but I was proud of myself today. A little quick backstory. When I was a teenager, my mother married a very violent, felon and criminal. He would regularly beat us, terrorize us, and needless to say, it affected my education. I was kicked out of  th grade, and had to go to another school. From the age of   to   years old, I never went to the doctor, the dentist, went clothes shopping, or had a haircut. By the time I was   years old my hair was way past my bottom almost touching the back of my knees. I also graduated high school living in a homeless shelter. My mother and her ex, were addicts, and teenage years were absolutely horrible. I regularly read books from a very young age, so I had a healthy vocabulary, I was articulate and I knew how to spell very well. Anyway, my math education was lacking. Math is very formulaic, and I always had difficulty with it. Last semester, I got all A's, and this semester I just started taking career math. Today was my first day. These past couple months I went on Khan Academy to freshen up for math class. While in class today, the professor put a problem up on the board. A division sign, a minus sign and some parentheses. He asked the class for the answer, no one knew what it was. Because I practiced so much these past few months, I raised my hand and told him the answer. I found out that I was right, and he asked why, I said that parentheses means multiplication. It's really silly, but I felt proud of myself today. I've never been able to raise my hand in a math class and give a right answer, and the reasoning behind it. No matter what background you come from, you can do it.

732,1681454995.0,college,"Did I overreact about people having sex in the shower?Sorry for the long post in advance and I didn’t know if this was the right flair. I’m tired 🥲

I have been living in the same dorm hall since I was a freshman and when we have orientation, the staff always say “don’t have sex in the showers. It’s uncomfortable for other residents who also have to use that bathroom”. I’m a senior now and there hasn’t been any issues. 

I currently live in a room that shares a wall with the shower so I can hear when people start the shower or play music. Most of the time it’s relaxing as just white noise so never really had an issue. 

For the past  -  weeks there have been multiple instances of people using the shower as the sexy time spot. If this were a gender neutral bathroom and it was private in a sense that u had your own room. Probably wouldn’t care as much. 

 I have gone in to brush my teeth and the shower was going and I heard a dude in the shower with a girl, I just left and walked to the other bathroom down the hall. When I came back into my room I can hear them having sex. So I just put my headphones in and just try to forget about it. 

I’m in the bathroom and two people go in to the shower (I’m guessing they didn’t know I was there and I didn’t recognize it was   of them) until they start doing the thing. That’s when I just got up and left. Again frustrated but moved on. 

But within the past week there were multiple instances and it’s really becoming increasingly difficult to not say anything. Especially when this hasn’t been an issue before and I’m just trying to chill in my room and not hear other people’s sex experiences. 

Tonight I’m doing laundry and the same thing happens when I come back upstairs from doing the first load. It’s like  : pm and I talked to some of my friends about it before and they said I should talk to my RA/SRA. Luckily she was on duty. She is also my friend. I explain the situation and she agreed that it was uncomfortable and inappropriate. 

She did her RA duties and said she was gonna contact the RD about it to send out an email reminder to the building and that was the end. 

Until later when I’m finally finished at   am. So I just went and opened the door and said “people can hear you and this is a public bathroom for the people who live in this wing. It’s really uncomfortable to hear what’s going on” (not verbatim as I’m tired and over it) then I put up a sign that basically says the same thing (the SRA suggested it). After that they stopped at least with the noise as it’s also I was able to just chill and here we are. 

I just wanted to know if I was being unreasonable. As a college student myself sometimes u just gotta get it 🙃.

I stopped texting for a while, and he sent multiple messages asking where I was and if I was okay. I just felt weird. He texted me a couple weeks later and asked if we could talk about the project, and I said okay.

 -  school year:  -  FAFSA will became available October  ,  . Requires   tax information.

* Create an [FSA account]( (also known as the FSA ID). This is your legal electronic signature to sign the FAFSA. It's linked to your Social Security number. If you are a dependent student, one of your parents will need to make one as well, assuming they have an SSN. If your parent already has their own FSA account, they must use that. If your parent does not have an SSN, they must print and sign the signature page manually, then mail it in.

* Gather all necessary documents, including bank statements, tax information (W- s, tax returns), any records of untaxed income, etc.

* Start the FAFSA! If you or your parent are given the option to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool, use it! It will drag tax information from the IRS straight to the FAFSA and save you a lot of time.

To clarify some things: I am  , I will be   this year, I have a job but I just can’t make enough to support myself yet, my DAD (who I don’t think anyone has considered yet) is partially on my side, Birmingham is dangerous but my mom is especially scared bc she is not from the city. 

My mother is controlling and overly cautious of everything. She is toxic but I don’t believe her to be “abusive” (maybe that’s just the language of the abused though). She also  % has anxiety as someone suggested. I understand why she wants to track me, I really do. But I just want to go out to eat with friends without her asking me who I am with, when we will be back, how is Sarah’s mom?, and what I ate...

I want more than anything to be independent. I acknowledge that I’m not yet (and it kills me). I make $ .  an hour and am trying to come up with another “side hustle” too.

I graduated back in May and started applying for jobs over the summer so I ordered an official transcript when I noticed there's no indication I received my degree, so I emailed the office that handles diplomas and they responded that I have a hold preventing me from graduating. I checked my bursar and I owe $ . , so I know it's not a financial hold. They responded and told me to email my advisor and check, so I did. I have   advisors because I minored in spanish, but my main advisor was horrible. She never responded to any of my emails and if she did it was two months later. So I assumed she was the issue, but I got an email over the weekend from my spanish advisor that I am   class short of graduating with a minor. Here's where the drama starts. I have   separate emails from this guy stating that studying abroad over the summer would complete my spanish minor because I was ""  class short of graduating with a minor"" then. But here's the thing, I was in   hours last semester and the study abroad fulfilled   classes or   credit hours, so I dropped the class I was in for the spring and signed up for the summer study abroad. I have an email asking for confirmation that ""I'm one class short now, so if I drop my current course and do the study abroad I will complete my spanish minor since it counts for two elective courses, right?"", to which I have two separate emails stating ""Yes, the study abroad will complete the spanish minor"".  

So what happens now? I dropped like $ ,  for this study abroad just to be told I'm still one class short when I was told last spring that it would be enough to complete it.

Ah, you are about to enter college and have high hopes and dreams for what you are going to do in college. People tell you it will be the best   years of your life and you will make so many memories. Enjoy this time because you will never get it back in your life. Also, this is the phase in life where you should be experimenting and trying things because, after all, you have so much more freedom than you ever might have in your life (yeah right).  


You enter college and maybe a year goes by, and well, you just feel extremely letdown and intense FOMO.  


This pretty much sums up my freshman year. I had envisioned myself joining technical clubs, and social clubs, going to parties, and making lots of friends and memories. I had created this very high ""image"" of what I expected from my college life. This image and expectation had just led to disappointment as I wasn't able to achieve them.  


Making friends was replaced by low confidence, low self-esteem, and image issues. Joining clubs was replaced with anxiety about grades and schoolwork. Going to parties was replaced by being a horrible networker who couldn't meet people. Going to college events was replaced with fear of chaos. I think you get the point here.   


What contributes to this anxiety is when people emphasize how important it is to make friends, maybe get in relationships, network in clubs, and go to social events and how we will miss out on this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. For me, this created intense FOMO. I'd wake up and beat myself up for having less life experiences than others and this lack of experiences affected my confidence because I thought I was just boring. Whenever I see others having fun, I fear that I am missing out and I will never get this chance again.   


I thought I was alone until talking with other peers and reading so many Reddit posts about how people are worried about missing out. I think this whole idea of ""college life"" is just a narrative shoved down our throats but the reality is that like no one achieves this.   


Throughout this first year, I learned just how bad I am at meeting people and forming friendships and just experiencing life in general. The whole ""have fun in college"" just feels like a scam. I've decided I'm gonna completely tilt in the other direction next year. I'm gonna focus on building my ego and my skills. Basically set me up to be a successful person after graduating college. If I can't have experiences and friendships, I'd at least want to grind life, do good in college, and become successful.  


I wouldn't say this often, but I would encourage some of you who feel stuck in a similar way to do something similar. Go grind at the gym and get a body. get a high GPA. start a club/business project because frankly, my ego and drive is the only thing I have faith in at this point.",2958,527,0

I can generally handle roommates from hell. I'm a sophomore, I went to boarding school for   years and had roommates lock me out of the room for tinder hookups, hide drugs in my fridge, and was once roomed with someone who hated my guts, but I can't handle this. As it stands, I'm living in an  x  room with someone who hardly leaves. All of our classes are at the same times, so I can't even rely on time to myself while she's in class. She always eats in the room, either microwaving her food in her microwave, or only leaving for roughly   minutes to go pick it up and come back. I know the typical response is to just tune her out, but I also have ptsd and am hypervigilant and literally can't do that.

Honestly, if it was just her not leaving, I'd likely be fine, but she's also very controlling of the environment in the room. She always wants the lights off and the heat on. If I even turn on the small light she gets up and turns it off within   minutes. It kills my head to be on my computer or phone with the lights off. The heat makes it so I can't sleep because I'm way too warm and literally wake up drenched in sweat. I can't work on my computer after she lays down to sleep because apparently she can't sleep with me typing, which isn't loud in the slightest, but I'm constantly hearing her music through her headphones and she won't turn it down.

I'm incredibly wound up right now because I have no privacy and am not allowed to take up space in my own room. Even if I leave the room (as I did today, I've been out for   hours), its not the same as alone time and I still have no personal space.

I think it's time for a change and I need help.So, my college life so far has been extremely bland. I've made   friends, and spend the majority of my time with at work, working on homework, or alone.

Working   jobs, one of them which kinda makes me miserable, kinda results in me being chronically underslept and as an invidual I've always been depressed and a loner. I've had   friends since middle school because some extreme trauma I went through made me extremely socially incapable since it resulted in me becoming mute and it's kind of hard to make friends with people when you can't speak to them. Although I've mostly recovered from the mutism, the social aspects of it still haunt me as being alone basically the entirety of my childhood has kind of trained me to prefer that way of living.

Freshman year I briefly attempted to make friends with my dorm hall but the social interactions were so mentally painful and exhausting for me I eventually gave up on it. And when I did eventually make one friend last year they were emotionally and financially abusive to me, and we kinda existed in a codependent relationship until I eventually cut them off during summer. I can understand my struggles freshman year since I'd just gotten out of an abusive household an was trying to cope with the changes. But even back then I feel like i left the dorm more.

This semester, I've just had even less motivation to make friends after cutting off the previously toxic one and knowing that everyone has basically settled into their frirnd groups. Because of that I know I've been in the dorm WAY more. But hearing it from the perspective of my roommates kinda stings. I've never wanted to be that kind of roommate. Kinda hurts more since I'd just got off an opening shift and decided to actually sleep for once, otherwise I wouldn't have been in the dorm right now because I DO leave sometimes. But still, I understand from having a roommate who never leaves how annoying it can be and I don't wanna be that person.

Professor did not pass me and I literally do not believe it was possible for me to pass. Not sure what to do.I had one class left to get my degree. The entirety of the class is a single group project; make a website to do X (don't want to get too specific). The professor did not give any explicit or written requirements for the project, just a few sentences at the start of the semester. Imagine something like ""Go make a site that behaves like Reddit. It should have users, mods and admins. Users can make posts, comments and edit them. Mods can do what users do + delete posts and comments. Admins can do what mods do + delete users, create users"". That was the level of detail.

We scheduled time with him last week to review it. We asked to schedule in advance because I have a kid and needed to get a babysitter. We were scheduled at  : pm. We got there early but at  :  when he arrived he sat down with another group. He didn't see us until  : . He looked at our site, logged in, tried the first link and was unhappy with what it did. He told us we failed, we clearly didn't meet the business requirements, we're not a good group and should find new partners and that we should start from scratch. He then said he had a class to teach soon soon and that we had to leave, he would not talk with us anymore.

It was insane. We had an entire semester of work into a site and he gave us literally <  mins and said we failed. I emailed him the next day asking him to please look again, there must have been a misunderstanding (was trying to be polite) and that we had a fully functional site. He responded the next day saying that he did not meet any business requirements, our implementation was entirely incorrect and we need to start over.

&#x B;

I emailed him again, reiterating the misunderstanding and listing off several business requirements we met (the things he said in the beginning of the semester) and that we just wanted him to review the entirety of our site because he only visited a single page. He agreed. We met with him yesterday and sat down for **  hours** reviewing our site. He was hostile and he nitpicked every single little thing, none of which were requirements he mentioned.  Things like: our site used military time instead of standard time. That one of the sections of the site only listed the user's email, not their phone number (email was a requirement, phone number was never mentioned) etc etc. At one point he complained we were missing something, I told him he could find it at a different part of the site and he said ""if you want to argue with me i'll just leave"". At the end he said he was going to mark our project as Incomplete, that we should both find new partners, we had a ton of work to do and that all our data was bad.

&#x B;

I do not believe it was possible to pass this class. I don't know if he had a grudge against me for some reason, if its because my group was entirely women, because im young and have a kid or what. I'm not claiming our site was perfect, we definitely missed some details here and there, but i'm  % confident it should have been sufficient to pass (its a graded class but hes just marking it as incomplete). I've reached out to other groups in the class and the majority failed and many of them were taking this class for the  nd or  rd time. He's been the only professor to teach this class for a few years but after enough complaints they added a  nd professor this semester apparently.

Why bother to study for anything since every test is open note open book open internet.  I'm not really learning, I'm struggling to complete meaningless tasks.

I live in an on-campus apartment at my university with   other housemates.

Within twenty seconds they came and knocked on my door, unlocked it with a key (without my consent), and opened to look into my room.

They did this with all of our rooms, including a roommate who left campus already (so I know she was not there to give consent).

But I did not give them permission to come in! They also seemed to be joking/laughing with each other during the process which seemed very unprofessional.

I feel like this is a violation of privacy. I'm very upset and not sure what to do.

**FAQ About Friends in College**


**What should I do when I arrive on college to meet people**

Okay so the first week on campus- especially in the dorms- there is a bit of magic in the air. Everyone is nervous and while some people may have friends from highschool or from their childhood- pretty much everyone is looking to make friends. Take advantage of this!!!!

* Be friendly and talk with people on your floor and in your building. Introduce yourself. Say your major, where you're from, what hobbies you have, etc. Its all small-talk but later on when you see them in the hall it will be easier to strike up conversation 

* Take Initiative. Instead of just saying hi to people- invite some people out to dinner. Or be that one person that organizes dinner with the entire floor (its not weird. Its college. Just fucking do it). If large groups scare you- find a few friendly faces on your floor and ask if they're up for dinner- or going to that cool, definitely not lame freshman event on campus. Or ask if someone wants to go watch the opening football game with you. Or ask if they just want to explore campus. It may be awkward asking people you don't know- but it will be worth it as the friendships grow stronger. 

* Keep your door open. Even if you don't take initiative other people probably will. But if you stay locked up in your room all day then no one will know you're there and you will feel left out. Keep the door open and I promise you there's a good chance you'll just get invited places. Even if you keep your door open don't just stay in your room staring at the wall. Go to the common areas- if you see people socializing just go them. Its not awkward. Its college. Just walk up and say ""Hi I'm chevy- where are you guys from"" or literally anything no one cares. You might meet some cool people, you might not. Might make some friends this way, might not. Still worth a shot. I made some of my friends in college the first week by just randomly talking about anime and CS with strangers- anything can happen. 

* Always say yes. If someone asks you to go to some random book event in the campus center SAY YES. When you start saying no and stop saying yes people will stop asking you to go places. You know all those lame sounding events in the dorms? Yeah no one really goes to them because they care about face painting. They go to meet people. Put yourself out there and don't reject opportunities to meet people

**What if I go to a commuter campus, community college, or live off campus?**

Not to worry my friend. Remember there are people in your shoes too and they want to make friends as well. 

The main advice I would give for people in this situation is to try and stay on campus as much as you can. If you are a commuter student- don't just head home after class. Stay on campus! Engage in any club activities and set your study schedule around these activities. Or get a job on campus. Or just study at the library on campus or wherever! Its hard to make friends when you're never at school. 

Also try talking to a lot of people in your classes. Obviously don't disrupt actual class time- but asking people in your classes if they want to study together or even just saying hi can start friendships. Don't be shy! 

**Its after the first week of school and I still have no friends. What can I do?** 

There are many things you can do! Here are some suggestions: 

* Talk to people in classes. Since class is well underway- you can talk to people in class about current assignments, upcoming assignments, upcoming tests, etc. Its not weird- its college. People are nice! If it is farther in the semester you can ask someone if they want to work on an assignment together or study together. I've never been told no when I asked someone- you typically learn better when you work together anyways!!

* Join a club on campus. Its easier to meet people when you share a common interest- and if you join the hiking club because you like hiking then surely you'll meet people there who also like hiking. Now you have a conversation topic of ""hiking"" you can talk to them about. Yay! If you have no interests you can always just join a club related to your major or career goals and socialize with people there (but if you join the club for your major you can't use the famous 'what's your major' question when first meeting someone). You can also join clubs if you have no knowledge of them and are potentially looking at a new hobby. 
In any case- clubs typically advertise to (mainly) freshmen at the start of each semester- so if your school has an area where the clubs set up little information booths like my school did- just go and talk to some members and get a vibe for the club. If the people seem cool- just join and hope for the best! 


* Get a job on campus. I know, it sounds crazy. But a lot of jobs in college are social and I know I personally made a lot of friends through my job. Even the people working in the dishroom at the dining halls in my school typically talk to each other and work shifts with each other frequently- so its a great way to meet coworkers. And there's never a chance you'll run out of things to talk about at your job because worst case scenario just complain about how working sucks and everyone will agree with you! Win-win. 

* If you live in a dorm: Talk to people!!! A lot of freshmen take the same classes. If you see someone in a study lounge (or similar) and they are working on an assignment for your class- there's no harm in asking them if they want to study with you! Or if you recognize someone in your building from one of your classes you can literally just be like ""Oh hey aren't you in Accounting  ?"". Then you can progress the conversation into asking them if they want to work on class stuff together- and if they live in the same building it'd be super easy to do so!


* Partake in random activities! At my school a lot of people would play pool/ping pong in the dorms and a lot of people would just ask to play or jump in and I got to meet some people that way. Or people play Frisbee outside, or random other games. Its not weird to ask someone if you can play- I promise you. Worst they can say is no- best they can say is yes and you end up with new friends (and have a cool game to play with them too!). 


* Go to parties/other social events. You don't have to drink/smoke/do anything you don't like. Parties have lots of people and its a very social setting- so obviously the potential to meet people there is possible. Even if you're awkward or introverted- plenty of people like that go to parties too. There are also just random events happening daily on campus- all of them can be good ways to find people to talk to!

**I am a sophomore/junior/senior/ and have no friends can I still make friends?** 

Of course. People are looking to make friends no matter what year they are. I made new friends every year I attended college- people do not just stick with who they met freshman year. 

**I don't like my friends, what do I do? Am I stuck with them?**
No, Silly. You can always get new friends. If you don't like your current friendgroup- make sure you don't spend all your time with them. Try to branch out by meeting new people in classes, joining a club, getting a new job on campus, etc. Eventually when you make new friends- you can leave your old friends behind. There are other tips earlier in the guide- you can always follow those if you relied a bit too much on the dorm magic to make your freshman friends!

**Do all your close friends come from freshman year?**

No. While its easier for friendships to become stronger if they start freshman year because you have   years to develop a strong bond with someone- close friends come from any year. The person I lived with for a few years I met freshman year- but the person I would call my closest friend I met my sophomore year in college. Some of the closest people that I remain in contact with after graduation I only met late Junior year or even senior year of college. You can make close friends any year- you never know who you may end up meeting!

**Am I the only one that feels so lonely?** 

No. 

Like I said- it is the most common topic on our sub. Lots of college students struggle with the adjustment. You are not alone. Stay strong and try to follow the tips I outlined in the rest of this little guide to make some friends. If you put in the effort I would find it very difficult to believe that you can't make a single good friend. 


**Still having trouble making friends?**


**RELAX**. Making friends takes time and effort. You cannot expect to make close friends immediately. Continue being yourself and you will find friends eventually. No one likes someone who is miserable because they feel alone. Remain positive and remember that there are other people in your shoes too. There is nothing wrong with feeling lonely in college, I'm sure most people on this sub have experienced it at one point or another. Keep doing you, take a deep breath, and enjoy college! The   years fly by quick. 


**Is there anything I should avoid to increase my potential to make new friends?**


*Yes*: 

* Avoid staying in your room all day. You cannot make friends if you hide from people 

* Avoid not talking to people. You cannot make friends if you are silent. I know I am a very quiet person but if I can force myself to talk to new people you can too. 

* Avoid remaining comfortable. Those   friends from highschool that came with you to college? Don't spend all your time with them. Branch out. Meet new people. Step out of your comfort zone. 


* Avoid not showering. If you smell bad people are less likely to talk to you 

* Avoid posting on this sub about not making friends. This won't help you make friends. Get off reddit and talk to real people instead. We can be your friends too but it probably won't replace the loneliness you feel in real life. 





I was by no means a social butterfly in college and felt loneliness plenty of times- especially being the only one at my out of state college from my highschool (ever!!). Stay calm, remain positive, and try to follow the basic advice outlined in this thread. Good luck! ",11025,2044,0

I forgot what I said but as soon as I said it he stopped cooking, looked over at me and stared for at least a minute, then went right back to cooking. Completely ignored me.

Should I be worried?So I'm taking this class with a very respected professor in his field (International level) and I'm enjoying the material of the course very much. We had an exam this week, and I asked him a question through an email saying ""Hey, when I was writing the exam, I thought of a few questions I wanted to ask"" and proceeded to ask them in the email (I was interested in the topics, so I had some out of interest questions), but I was met with ""The exam is done, why would you want more questions"" and proceeded to answer my questions somewhat rudely by telling me to ""Google it"". I mean, the professor's job is to answer questions students have rather than tell them to google it so I found it unprofessional. I was interested in the material so I wanted to volunteer for his lab at first, but now I don't think so. Usually, he's really friendly in emails and in person, I don't understand why he answered so harshly. Did I say anything wrong? How worried should I be? Am I overthinking this?

800,1644234128.0,college,"A professor just called me manipulative and disrespectfulI'm not from the USA, but in my university most exams and midterms are coordinated by the head professor of each subject, so they are the ones that decide the dates, the content, the exam format, etc. Well this semester I noticed that I had two different midterms on the same day, one from  :  to  :  am and the other one  : - :  am, so while they didn't overlap since they are being held in different buildings being on time to the second one would be impossible without finishing very early the first one. So I decided to write a formal email to both head professors, to see if anything could be done to ensure that we're able to take both exams on time, since both subjects are for second years normally the are more lenient and understanding with this stuff. The first head professor responded very quickly and told me that he couldn't do anything, the second head proffesor informed me that in this particular case she isn't the one in charge but the proffesor of our respective class is. So naturally I decided to talk to them instead, I write the same email and after a week without a response I decide talking to her directly. Here is where things escalated very quickly...

Basically she was deeply offended by the suggestion, acted like I was saying her subject was less important than the other therefore she must be the one to take on the extra work of changing It, I tried explaining that It certainly wasn't the case the other one just had said no already, and that I just wanted to see if she was open to the possibility to discuss It with the class. She then got somehow more offended and acted like I was trying to undermine her by asking first the headprofessor (again, they are the ones to deal with this stuff in most cases, how could I have known that in this case an exception was made for the midterms??), and called me manipulative for trying to talk her into changing things around (again, I just asked! No harm in asking...) especially without my peers present (I wanted the opportunity to discuss this matter in class with her permission!!). I felt incredibly humiliated and apologised many, many times for 'disrespecting her', but she was having none of It, I even ended up crying a little because I don't handle well people yelling at me and I already had a lot going on (kinda like the last drop to overflow the glass) but she just said that 'I won't be led on by any manipulative behaviour or mannerisms of yours, in any case you should be crying for the utter lack of respect you have towards me'

801,1592311404.0,college,"If you could give a freshmen a tip about dorming, what would it be?For me, I’d say: 

Every roommate has a small, petty habit that gets on your nerves. And yes, you probably have one that gets on their nerves, too, they just don’t tell you. It could be something like they put their calls on speaker or never leave the dorm except for class. In my experience, I had a roommate who would always lock the door into our bedroom because she was scared we’d get robbed. Our room was a suite with three rooms: the kitchen/living room and two bedrooms, and the front door. This got kind of annoying at times because I’d always have to get my keys from off the counter after putting them down. And one morning, I was half asleep and needed to use the bathroom so I got locked out of my bedroom because I didn’t realize she locked the door. This is coming from somebody with anxiety disorder who worries about safety to an ungodly degree, it was annoying, and our school is in a bad area, so you better believe it’s well guarded. Because of this, there’d be times when she’d lock herself out and make me stop what I was doing on campus to go open the door, as you only got three free tries from security before they fined you. 

But it’s a small petty habit like that, who gives a shit? You’re allowed to be annoyed but your roommates are going to have that. If it’s something like they go through your clothes without permission or make you uncomfortable, then tell an RA.",1464,275,0

In other words, if you did not register for the draft, this will have no bearing on whether or not you can receive federal student aid.

This is HUGE news, and something we’ve been waiting on for a long time. We had an idea that this was coming, but thought it would be several more years. As someone who’s worked in this field for years, I’ve had to deny many, many students federal aid because of this. Transgender students, students who were incarcerated, and students who were not citizens between the ages of  - . Students who *needed* the money.

Outside of FSA, this is huge progress and shows where society, and, more specifically, the Department of Education, currently stands on the SS. It means that, aside from potentially diminished chances at landing a government job, consequences of not registering are nearly nonexistent.

My father passed away last Friday and it has been really hard on me. On top of already suffering from PTSD, it's definitely a really difficult time for me to get through.

So many of the replies to these discussions are so empty and lacking any thought. It is like they lack any critical thinking or like they simply want to reply to the discussions and get the points. The guidelines say that our replies are supposed to be ""substantive add to the discussion (i.e. reflecting on their response, asking questions, etc.)"" but none of my classmates in the group do that. And on top of that the grammar is horrible and at least one of these with shit grammar is a *senior.* All my classmates do is agree to whatever the other person posted and then say something like ""it was really interesting"" or ""what you wrote made a lot of sense"". Two others along with myself try to follow the guidelines as best as we can. I struggle because there is nothing of substance to reply to.

>What caught my attention about you response is that you explained both questions. Not only that but I also say that you quoted your source. I feel that quoting your source gives more credibility to your response.

The above is a reply from one classmate to another. I can't help but laugh because our professor said that since we were all reading the same book we didn't need to site the source. We could paraphrase and use quotes from the book without worrying that we would be docked points for plagiarizing. I also can't help but laugh because that person's reply is so empty. Perhaps it is because the professor is very lenient with grading, maybe that's the issue here. I read these replies and I'm shocked these are university students. This was shit that I was writing as a freshmen in high school, back when I didn't care about my grades. But this is university for crying out loud, I thought the level of discussions and writing would be at third year uni level.

Anyway, is this just an issue in the U.S that is a reflection of our shit education system? Or am I seeing some sort of generational issue here? Thoughts?

862,1633814604.0,college,"My Advice: If you ever feel slow and dumb or are struggling in a class, focus on overcoming the difficulty instead of your intelligence and trust in that processI mean my dad told me a story about when he was a student. He was in a spatial geometry class and he was the slowest one in the class. Everybody else seems to be much quicker then him. However, he never gave up and tried his best. He eventually overcame all difficulties and become even better at the subject then everybody else. 

I have a mental illness that causes me to constantly assess my intelligence and care too much about it, even if their's no evidence that I was struggling in any classes. I always think to the future about some difficult classes coming up and I'm worried I'm going to be the slowest and stupidest one in the class. I always have the tendency to put myself in the shoes of another (such as a mathematician) or to think myself in a certain situation (such as being in a programming class) and then always ending up forming the conclusion that I might be below average or stupid (even if I wasn't struggling in any classes this semester at all). I always think back to the one programming class in which I have to take as a accounting major that I struggled with more than others. I always go to my dad for advice when such thoughts pop up. 

My dad's advice is usually this, and I feel it helped alot. He taught me to focus on the effort, not your innate talent or intelligence. He said for me to be positive and ignore such thoughts and focus on what you're supposed to be doing. I feel that this helped alot. I mean programming is kinda my own fault as I didn't work hard enough to overcome it and focused more on intelligence instead. 

My dad taught me a story of how he's the slowest one at work (I'm not sure if he's making this up or not), he's a engineer. He said everybody is faster then he is at figuring stuff out, however he still didn't feel discouraged or give up (despite not being the sharpest knife in the drawer). Instead he used whatever cards that he's dealt to work hard to figure things out (even if it takes him longer) and asks other's for help when needed. Eventually he ends up performing equally as well or even better then the people that are supposedly smarter and quicker.

The point of me telling everybody this is that if you ever feel that you're slow and dumb and aren't the sharpest knife in the drawer, you shouldn't focus to much on the fact that you aren't naturally smart or as quick witted as some other people. Instead you should focus on trying to overcome the difficulty and believe in the fact that if you try hard enough and never give up, everything's eventually going to click. If you struggle with applying what you learned or with logical thinking, do more practice and eventually things would get easier. 

Remember their are people with good genes that don't make the best of their abilities simply because they're lazy and that hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard. 

If you're naturally smart, then great. But if you aren't, just trust in the process and not give up.",3126,575,0

Since meeting my roommate  at the beginning last college semester (August), he’s never seemed to have a problem with me being shirtless in the mornings before class, or when I’m in the dorm for the night (the only time I’m really in the dorm). Being shirtless has always been more comfortable for me, and in my own personal home, I typically walk around shirtless. 

Last night, he expressed his feelings and said he doesn’t like me being shirtless in the room because it makes him feel insecure. I’ve always invited him to workout and run with me and this isn’t the first time I’ve heard him complain about his weight.

You were looking forward to this time, so you better take advantage of it. I know, you are only home for a limited time and you want to see all your friends. That's cool. But take some small time to actually take care of yourself.

\- If you are spending it at home, then please spend some time hanging out with your parents and family. If you got them nearby, go see your grandparents. Looking back, I wish I would have just spent a bit more time with my mom when I was home.

\- Check your grades. Celebrate, cry, ponder, but take a moment to really look at where you are and see if you are doing as you expect. Not liking your classes? Still want to major in that? Is this your  rd time taking a course? Sit down and really evaluate where you are, and if you are taking the right steps to get to where you think you want to go.

\- Check on your funds. Those of you that are lucky to have your parents pay for your education, please do not take it for granted. If you know you are going to be short for the next semester, look at job options, loans, and any possible scholarships. Mapping out how much you are going to owe before you start can put you in a better position.

\- If you are considering not going back to school, like you are for sure not going back, TELL SOMEONE. You do not need a big fat bill showing up on your doorstep because you failed to withdraw the correct way. Tell admissions, tell a family member, and talk to someone. Do not assume that this will be taken care of.

\- If you are feeling down over break, find someone to talk to. Yes, it is okay to text a friend and say ""Hey, if you got a minute to talk or hang, I would really appreciate it. I am not doing well right now."" Reach out to people. Talk it out. Do not bottle things up. Help is out there.

\- If your graduation is in the upcoming year, or you know you are going to be doing a lot of interviews soon, make sure you got a professional sounding email and an updated resume.

872,1654789937.0,college,"A Lot of Students Have Really DeclinedI hope I don't sound like those ""holier than thou"" profs, but I need to say this: COVID has really made some students get lazy and more entitled. I am an undergraduate myself, and I have been TAing for four semesters now. Most of my students are great or they don't cause any problems. But this semester I definitely had a few bad apples. For context, I TA general physics classes meant for biology and chemistry majors. I try to understand that taking a physics class after lots of biology can be challenging for them and they do not know as much math, and I try to be cognizant of their situation, but some of the behaviors and excuses I have seen are just completely ridiculous.

One student did not know how to use the chain rule when a semester of calculus   is a prerequisite and then complained how unfair it was they have to know how to take derivatives. I explained that yes they need to know how to do derivatives as that's a prereq for this course and it is their responsibility to review those derivative rules if they feel like they need to brush up.

Another student got a question completely wrong, so I explained the correct answer and why they were wrong and they said ""Yeah obviously we know that; we're not stupid."" They then proceeded to call me rude and condescending for correcting their mistake. I even asked how they felt I could be more conscious while correcting them and the student couldn't tell me anything.

A student gave me a very low score in TA evaluations because they felt it was unfair that they have to solve the workshop problems themselves and that I should be doing them on the board for everyone (yes someone actually said this). I decided to write more setups and important concepts and equations on the board to help, but some students called me lazy and distant for only doing this because ""he doesn't want to do the work.""

This is the one that takes the cake though. I had to grade their participation in workshop. The professor told the TAs to have   out of   points for just attending and the other   points for how much they participated. This one group of students did not participate that much, so I did not give them  /  on their workshop grade. They emailed me saying how they feel that my grade for them was so unfair. I did not have much faith in how much work they did, so I wanted to see if they could back it up, so I told them I would raise their grades if they could show me written work for the workshops and gave them a deadline. Most of the group followed through, and i raised their grades accordingly. Then they responded saying how they feel that it is so ""hurtful"" that I didn't raise their grades even more. One student did not make the deadline and emailed me a day after, and I just said ""No I'm sorry. You were late, so I will not be raising your grade,"" and then I got a nasty email after that as well.

While most students I work with are great, I keep seeing an increase in this ridiculous entitled behavior, and this is ridiculous. Is anyone else seeing this, or does this seem to only be a problem at my college?

Edit: For the comments describing how COVID has been very rough for them, I can sympathize. COVID has definitely affected many students negatively and caused them struggle. Most profs and TAs are aware of this. That said, I think it is best to email profs and TAs and explain your situation and explain the ways you need support, not make entitled demands and not put in any kind of effort. Many students have constructively talked to me about this, and we were able to find a solution.

892,1698142570.0,college,"Sunk   hours into two essays for them to count towards my grade.Edit: sunk five hours into two different essays just for them to not count towards any grade (even final grade)


Does anyone consistently do work for it not even count towards anything numerical in the class?

Yesterday I had two exams, one which I studied for about   hours, the other three hours. Then I had work- just a six hour shift. Then I get back home to spend five hours on writing essays that aren't even being graded. I think I went to bed at   just to go to clinical at  . I'm running on four hours of sleep, I'm so cold and so exhausted. This is every week, doing the shit for this stupid art class which has more work involved than my pharmacology course. 

I'm a nursing student, I am past the point of caring about getting good grades, I just want to pass my non-core classes.

Should I talk to the prof? I'm not at work enough, I'm getting in trouble for not making the hours, I don't have enough time to study, I don't have enough time do spend on things that don't count for a grade. 

I'm a junior, my last  .  semesters. What do I even do?

Edit: okay, since some of you have issues with my post I'm going to make this crystal clear. 

Yes I am doing two degrees at once, yes this is possible. Look it up, lots of bachelor programs are partnering with different schools connected to magnet hospitals. I will graduate with my associates next may, and my bachelors the next may after that. Hence why I'm focused on my nursing courses and not my gen Ed's. Thank you so much to the person that pointing out my grammatical mistakes. I'm so sorry that I made this post when I was upset and on four hours of sleep and also on the OB surgical floor (high acuity if you're not in the medical field). So I was quite busy at the time and no my professional writing does not look like that. I am taking   credits, this art class is one credit, my clinical are   credits, my lab is   credit, my pharm course is three credits, my OB/PEDS/ MED SURGE course is three credits and I'm also taking a philosophy course for three credits. Im trying to finish my bachelors as fast as possibly, I never take a break, I take one class every winter break and three classes over summer. I've always done this and yes it sucks but school sucks and I want to get it over with. 

This class is not an art history course, it's called art anatomy where we have to pick events that we do essays and class presentations on, so every week two essays and two presentations plus traveling to an art Museum/ show to gather data. All in all this class takes me about   hours per week just to do the bare minimum. Which seems excessive since that's not accounting for the three hours of class time that it takes up during the week.

For those of you who encouraged me to talk to my prof, I did end up going to her in person after class. They do count for a grade, she was just using the wrong syllabus attached to the course (how do you not notice that you have uploaded the wrong document for a particular class is beyond me). So, yes I got it worked out with her, and now I don't feel as terrible about me ""wasting time"". 

And everyone that is saying ""if MLA is so easy why did it take you five hours"", this paper was five pages long, single spaced and a small font (in respect to the profs paper policy). Complete with citations, headers and formatting it takes a while to make. For all of you that say MLA is easy, in comparison it is, to APA. I've never been trained to do APA, even in high school and middle school everything was MLA all day. I've been writing in this format since- fifth grade. That was   years ago so by god, I would HOPE that I know how to do it by now. 

For all of those who came in with a supportive response, you're awesome, keep being you. For everyone that gave snarky responses, just why? Why can't you put yourself in another persons shoes. Grow up. ",3932,748,0

Turns out, he’s an editor of a mathematics journal and has a ton of published textbooks! Like, actual physical textbooks that you can get on Amazon and teach with. That’s the first time I’ve ever seen a professor have that.

895,1649608192.0,college,"Update: I am a college professor taking a freshman level college course this semester…here is what I have learned so farCollege is hard.  Really really hard.  I have an entirely new appreciation for how difficult learning new material is after this experience.  With a few weeks left to go…here is what I have learned so far.

- if you are lucky enough to be going to school and just focusing on school, please take advantage of it and study/learn all you can.  I don’t have kids, but I have a full time job, freelance gigs, a boyfriend, two cats and a dog.  All these things need my attention.  I get interrupted so much while I’m sitting at the kitchen table trying to study.  I was taking a timed exam Tuesday and my dog did his “I need to poop dance” and I could not leave the computer.  He pooped on the floor and ate it.  So if you are lucky enough to not have kids or a full time job, please take advantage of this time because you will never be able to focus like this again in your life.
- I think social media has killed our attention spans.  I do not remember having this much trouble focusing when I was in college   years ago.  I have to read and reread and reread again to understand.  I was also diagnosed with ADHD in my  s so not sure if that’s part of it, but lord do I have trouble focusing and processing.  Makes me wonder how many students struggle with just reading and taking notes and taking a test.  It’s a really difficult way to learn.
- prioritize where to put your energy.  I wrote my first post because I got a   on the first test.  It is important to me to get A’s.  So I analyzed the grading break down and realized in the grand scheme, the tests don’t count for that much.  I stopped stressing so much over studying for the tests and made sure to hit every single other assignment and even though my tests continue to be in the  -  range, I have an A average in the class.

As much as I can’t wait to be done with the semester, I’m glad for this experience.  I learned a lot as a professor about things that work and don’t work.  There are some weeks where there is just too much work and I can’t get it all done.  So I do my best.  I teach a class very similar to the one I am taking and I will be revising how I teach it significantly after this experience.  Good luck on the rest of the semester to everyone who is reading this, we can do it and a break is almost here!!",2406,467,0
896,1615809473.0,college,"When I am discouraged about college, old replies from professors help lift my spiritsAt the end of every semester, after final grades come out and things settle a bit, I send a short email to my professors thanking them for their patience and time in teaching me. I briefly mention my favorite parts of the class, little things they did that meant a lot, and how I'll incorporate their lessons in the future. 

(I do this after final grades are released so they don't get the impression that I'm trying to kiss up to boost my grade. Also because I feel like teachers are also stressed at this time, trying to get all the students processed and grade all their exams.)

Even if their class wasn't my favorite or if I did poorly, it reminds me to count my blessings. 

Most of the time they appreciate me reaching out, extend words of encouragement, and wish me well on my journey. 

I pin these replies and save them in a folder for a rainy day. 

Last semester I experienced a rough patch that affected my academic performance. I used to be enthusiastic about school and learning in general, but for some reason even the smallest amount of reading (which is my primary and most reliable study method) required a great deal of energy to complete. My test anxiety was at its worst. I felt like my old self that desired knowledge and enjoyed college was gone. A few days ago, I was scrolling through old emails and I found a few from my former professors. Although a small gesture, their words of encouragement really helped me get out of that funk and helped renew that familiar curiosity that motivated me to pursue my degree. They believed in me, even though I didn't believe in myself. 

I just wanted to share this with all of you. You don't have to do what I did though. I hope this can help someone. Thanks for reading this far. College can be overwhelming, anxiety ridden, and stressful as it is, let alone during a pandemic which has changed so many aspects of life. Even though I'm just a random person on reddit, I believe in each of you, and I wish you the best in your academic and personal endeavors. :) Stay safe.",2125,388,0
898,1683529839.0,college,"I’m an RA. I hate my residents more than anything.It’s finals week here at my college, I’ve been an RA for a semester and I am quitting next year. My residents have made my life absolutely miserable. I attend classes with some of them, and while they act completely fine in class, are absolute shitheads in the dorms. They just most recently called the ra on call on ME when I was talking with my friends in a common area and studying while they were studying in an adjacent room, while last night they were throwing a party and have been yelling at all hours of the morning. It’s only been   rooms who are close to each other that have seemed to pit each other all against me. I am so sick and tired of this, and while this whole situation with them has been going on, it’s not even a majority of why I’m leaving. I can’t believe how inconsiderate, grossly negligent, and irresponsible people these residents all are, and if I hear any loud noise from them I am having no warnings anymore and immediately writing them up. I hate them, I hope they hate me back because I never want to interact with them after this school year.

Edit: So this got a lot more traction that I assumed it would. Due to some confusion, here is my copy and pasted comment for further context. 

For people asking for missing context - I apologize, I got really heated last night and then passed out. I used to my friends with these residents before I became an RA for the same building I lived in last semester. At the start of this semester they pulled a fake, unmarked gun on me and pointed it at other residents of mine. After getting a heavy write up for that, they became borderline violent with their retaliation and began to scream at me nightly or when they saw me. The girlfriend of the boy who pulled the fake gun on me called me a “fucking bitch” when I was walking to a meeting and attempted to chase me down the hall. Her friends held her back. I have been more than lenient with them since this incident, because I have been worried about genuinely being shot in my dorm. I can afford not being an RA, even though it will take a huge toll on my finances. I honestly loved my job before this whole mess. It isn’t even the reason I’m leaving as well, my bosses transferred me to another area that would be a serious downgrade from my current situation and wouldn’t listen when I asked for negotiation on the area.

The same residents that I have problems with have also been arrested, drink heavily almost every night (to the point of alcohol poisoning), are incredibly racist and homophobic, and on top of that have been nearly kicked out of housing on multiple accounts.

I will fully admit that I can be hot headed towards them, but I have been dealing with them for far too long. I genuinely love my job, and I am heartbroken that I’ll be leaving some of my favorite co workers and miss out on a great training with them. I was planning on returning before I found out I would be transferring areas, but I know I wouldn’t be happy if I had transferred there.

Best of luck on finals all, I hope this provides some well needed context from my very pissed off post last night.",3168,594,0

The day I get sick with some sort of stomach bug (pretty much just severe nausea) I drive to class early, on my way I think, hey, it's a test, maybe if I ask my professor if I could take it in the hallway outside of class he'd let me. 
I get there and I go to walk to his office. At this point I'm physically struggling, like clutching the walls, deep breathing. I'm standing outside his office and I'm just like ""if I start to talk I think I'm actually going to throw up"" so I walk back out to my car and sit in it for a solid fifteen to twenty minutes. 
I feel pretty much no better, and I'm like, ok I physically can't do this. I don't care if I get a zero at this point so I just drive home, I later message him telling him what happened and sure enough there's nothing I can do.

I'm not really mad about it, but I just find it crazy that if a student gets an illness that they physically have no control over whatsoever and try their best to get to class and Is just unwell enough to do so they just immediately fail? Like what if I had COVID? You're telling me I pretty much got an F for following the colleges rules on illnesses? Just weird.

Edit: 
Since a lot of people are responding and offering really helpful advice I have some things I should probably add that I forgot to. 

I emailed him in the parking lot before leaving explaining the situation, and got the ""no make ups, final exam replaces lowest score"" response. The final exam policy is something I forgot to mention as it's been stapled in every college class I've taken since I started going there, so I had forgotten to mention it in my post. 
I don't think I'm going to drop the class as it's General Psych and I'm pretty confident in my ability to still pass, but I do still have a lot of time until the drop date in case i change my mind.

My biggest regret in life is cheating. I have cheated in every class in college. My mind was too preoccupied with wanting to finish school in   years, so I piled on classes every semester. I didnt study. I learned nothing. I would go into class with a game plan to cheat on exams. 

I majored in accounting, from my Accounting I class to the upper level bachelors classes, I cheated. I regret that so much. I have such little accounting knowledge. At work, my boss started asking me elementary accounting questions and I couldn't answer him. I was so embarrassed and I knew then that he regretted hiring me. 

I am typing this with embarrassment. I beg you to not cheat in college. I faked my way through everything. In   months I am starting a new job with a big company and I am so nervous. I don't have the knowledge to to the job, just the degree.

And I knew that I loved anatomy and whatnot. So I enlisted in the army for   years as a medic and did that with the benefit of **almost** free college. I also worked in a hospital drawing blood and stuff and have a very good side hustle working with antiques (essentially museum conservation). I have now been working on a biology degree with the original intent on going to med school. But I don’t want to go to med school anymore because I’d like to enjoy my  s- s, have a life (I worked in a hospital I know what they go through) and not have  k+ in debt. Now I’ll get into why I feel like college is a waste, I have taken soo many classes, and it’s just like highschool. You take a class that has nothing to do with what you’ll do in a career and throw everything away that you learned once the semester is over. You do the real learning on the job, I worked with nurses that didn’t remember anything important from college, I have had to teach them things in the hospital (I don’t have a degree I’m just a nobody). I swear I have met so many people with degrees that don’t know much of anything. Also what really angers me is how there is no standard in colleges, each professor essentially writes their own rules. My chemistry professor made a pass/fail system  % or more on each quiz to get a point. Any lower than  % and you’d get a  %. Take the same class with a different professor, and the whole grading system is different. Go to the same class at a different college and it is taught completely differently. No standard at all. I have learned so much outside of college and have made wayyy more connections outside of college, I have grown wayyy more without college. I believe I can be successful without having a degree, seems like a waste of time.

I’m just going to add that nobody in my family has a degree but some of my family members currently work on college boards. Funny huh no degree and making decisions for the college. Colleges are just a business trying to take as much money as they can.

**Tip #  Use Rate My Professor and Pick Easy Professors/Classes for Your Gen-Eds**

- this is my best advice! No need to go out of your way for a challenging class or professor especially if it’s your first year. You’re still getting used to college and no one will judge you for taking the easiest option available, especially for your gen-Ed classes where you might not ever use the information you learn again. I tend to look for professors rated  . -  stars for each of my classes and take note of them so I can register when the time comes. Taking easy classes during your early semester will help later on when you have actual difficult classes. 


- Edit: Tip #  Cont. Read reviews and find professors that teach how you learn. If you suck at essays, try not to take a professor with a bunch of essays. Same with quizzes etc. Some things you can’t avoid but different professors have different teaching styles for the same content. Find what works best for you!

**Tip #  Check Your Syllabus Weekly**

- I check my syllabus at least once a week to make sure I know what to expect for the upcoming week and make sure I didn’t miss anything. Also, I promise you all of the info you need is on your syllabus or something similar. Deadlines? Check the syllabus. Quiz? Check the syllabus. Group project? Check the syllabus! It’ll save you so much stress if you check your syllabus for the upcoming week and take note of upcoming assignments. 


**Tip #  Go to Office Hours / Tutoring (when you need it)**

- I’m not saying that you have to go to every single office hour session but if you’re struggling with a specific topic, I strongly recommend showing up. Even if you’re afraid to ask in class, you can quickly get help during office hours and feel confident that you know what to do. My professors were so kind and helpful during office hours and were glad I came for help even if it was so simple. 


**Tip #  Break Down Your Assignments Into  Specific Tasks and Write It All Down**

- I thrive on checking things off so I use a notebook (use whatever is most practical for you) and I write down every single thing I have to do to complete an assignment for the current week. Assignments can look daunting so breaking it down can help you to quickly get things done and make progress even if you don’t do it all in one go. So even if it’s just researching info before writing an essay, I like to be aware of all the necessary work needed to complete a task so I can prepare accordingly. The worst thing ever is leaving an assignment for last minute and realising it’s a lot more than you bargained for. 


**Tip #  Don’t Wait For The Right Time To Do Work**

- If you’re free now, WORK now. I don’t believe in a set schedule because things come up or change constantly. Have five minutes before you go out? Plan that essay. That’ll be five minutes less later. Class got canceled, (nap, then) catch up on stuff with the extra time. Don’t wait till it’s the perfect time or place to get work done or you’ll never get it done. Think about the time you’ll save later if you use that time now.

I did the assignment by hand (my handwriting is not messy, so I know legibility is not as issue) and submitted it on time. I spent a lot of time studying for this and I didn’t miss a single question. However, I got a B because the assignment was “unprofessional” for being hand written. This was the first project of the year so there was not an expectation set beforehand in previous assignments. Would it be unreasonable to reach out to the professor and ask if the assignment can be redone (typed out of course)?

Edit: for those of you asking, there is not any mention of formatting in the syllabus or assignment. His message said that it must be done in a word document. I sent him a message stating that I was not aware of this requirement and asked if I could re-do the assignment. I am still waiting on a response.",1067,192,0

I really don't think a  . % and a  % are worth two different grades. It's the same amount of work. I think a grade that is so close to being upped to another letter grade should at least be able to be requested to be upped when it's in the  . - .  percents. I get this can be tough for a professor to do something like this, and some students will take a mile when you give an inch, so it's only sensible that professors stray away from bumping up their students a grade.

Basically what I'm saying is I both understand completely why a professor would refuse to do this, and why a student would ask. I think overall it's something that should be completely avoided to avoid frustration and awkwardness for both ends. I hope this makes sense. This is just my opinion.

Maybe I can't relate because I had a weird high school experience myself but I imagine most of you have had the same friend group since elementary school and don't know any different. 

It's not a big deal to be alone sometimes. People come and go, have different schedules, or just nothing in common. Put yourself out there and do everything you can but just starting out at college you'll honestly tie yourself down if you expect to have a ""group"" right off the bat. Your interests and whats important to you will change, for now it's perfectly normal to talk to as many people as possible and as you explore college as well as yourself some things will stick and others won't, that's just life. Don't interact with people with an expectation they'll be your best friend, relax, and enjoy getting to know others from different backgrounds.

Trust me, literally NO ONE cares if you're doing things alone sometimes. Get comfortable with yourself, because that's probably the first step to getting comfortable with others.

I am in a minor program for a foreign at my university. I am about halfway through completing the minor but it is getting really tedious. They rarely offer my classes and the work is way more difficult and takes up more time than my major classes. I'm not sure whether to continue getting the minor or just drop it as it has taken something that I was super passionate about and made it a headache. The classes also counted towards my major as it has a foreign language requirement so it hasn't been a total loss. I just don't know if its even worth it to finish it out.

989,1708889859.0,college,"Room Lockouts and Security's Failing SystemI've had a lot of issues recently with my college and thought it was important to share.

For context, I'm a sophomore at a private school in Virginia. After two years here, I have had many issues with ResLife and it's continuing to worsen. I currently have a service animal and this is his second semester here with me. ResLife has also told me I'm required to keep him on a leash, whenever his tasks interfere with it. But that is a whole other issue.

Last fall semester, I was cleared to move in (via email) early because of my dog. I went to pickup my keycard, and was told I couldn't move in early because the worker had not received an email from the director giving me permission to move in. She refused to help me for a while, and after an hour finally agreed to make some phone calls. It took two hours for me to get into my room.

This semester, I was also cleared to move in early due to my dog. I drove halfway across the country, finally arrived at my school (after  pm on a saturday), and keyed into my room. I put my animal in my room, and went to continue moving stuff out of my car. I left my phone in my room on accident. Whenever I tried to key back into my room, it didn't work. My key card had been invalidated (I tried every door, and other people's keys worked), and my dog was stuck in my room. Normally I would call security, but I didn't have my phone. A security car was driving past, and I ran after them waving and yelling for help. They drove away. I had to break through my window in order to get in. The next morning I called security, and they told me the **only** lady who was authorized to remake key cards was not in until tomorrow. This meant my ""early"" move in became be moving in on the first day of classes, which led to a slue of other issues.

Now, I have been locked out of my room again. My key is invalidated and if I want in my room, it means calling security and waiting anywhere from   minutes to an hour. I called to be let in, and when they arrived I told the worker this is the second time this has happened to me, and we need to figure out a way for me to get my key replaced today. My service animal is currently sick, and this means potty trips every   minutes or so. Propping doors open is not an option, since you go through three doors to get outside and lots of people in and out of the halls. I was told that he would ""see what he could do"" and walked away without telling me any other information. We went back and forth for a few minutes on what supervisors need to be contacted, and who I would be hearing from.

A few minutes later I received a call from our VC, saying there is essentially nothing that can be done besides call security or her. Both of these things take \~  minutes, if I'm lucky. Overall, our security system is broken. If the one woman who is allowed to remake our cards turned up dead, they would have another security officer do it. I should be able to have my card replaced during the weekend, not just Monday-Friday  am- pm.

I applied undecided because I have broad interests and didn’t want to box myself into anything before I’ve even finished all of my high school classes. The past few months I’ve been doing some serious research into potential majors and careers, and I only see negative discussions everywhere I look.

The main career path I’ve been considering is law; but in all online spaces for lawyers and law students, they say that law school isn’t worth it and that you’ll inherently end up in hundred’s of thousands of dollars worth of debt you can never pay off, and that you’ll hate your life all through law school and for the whole duration of your legal practice.

So scratch that.

I’ve loved math classes my whole life and am taking college-level math classes in high school. Maybe I could major in math and—nope. Apparently the job market is basically nonexistent for anyone not in statistics. And even then it’s not guaranteed that you’ll make good money.

Scratch that too.

Humanities degrees are apparently all useless. I’ve seen people even say that STEM degrees outside of tech and engineering are also largely useless. And not one professional in any of the fields I’ve ever felt interest in has positive things to say.

It’s impractical to not be money obsessed even though I don’t want to be. Everyone seems to be pessimistic about college and life thereafter. And I understand why reality pushes people toward that mindset. But I have absolutely no confidence going into college that I’ll be able to commit to a subject which interests me that is also able to open doors for me to live comfortably, and balance quality of life and earning potential.

Is everything actually so bad? I don’t really have anyone in my life that has an apparent direct application between their degree and their career, and I know a lot of people in debt. It’s just really troubling.",2076,360,0

However, there has been some issues.
So there's an English class I take. The professor enjoys talking to the students. He tends to joke and banter alot but at least he's more tame with it towards me. But of course because of that, sometimes the students and will banter and tease each other as well and with the professor sometimes.
However, there's this one classmate ( f) in the course who does join in the bantering with others. However she has starting to somewhat pick on me. She seems to be the type to hide it with ""it's a joke"" but even if she was, she's not that ignorant. She could tell I feel uncomfortable around her. I did try to ignore her but it's been getting out of hand. Unlike my professor, she doesn't care when she's going too far. She seems to like getting a negative reaction from others, especially from ME.
I don't know exactly why nor do I care why because there's never a good reason to continuously do something that will make someone uncomfortable. She's literally an adult and still acting like some high school mean girl.

Yesterday, I finally spoke to my professor since he's been getting concerned with my mood shifts in class.
I told him everything. Despite me not knowing the girl's name, he does. He at least understood how I felt. He even stated how while he does enjoy the bantering and teasing in class, he will not tolerate it if it goes too far, especially if someone is getting uncomfortable. He told me that he'll do something about it and have a word with her.

I hope he means it. I could be wrong but I noticed how college seems to take bullying/harassment more seriously than middle/high school.
Even if my professor's gonna take care of it, I still wonder if there's a way to get her name, just in case she attempts on retaliating. I could try using the student portal/Canvas but my professor doesn't use it, he just emails us for class announcements and reminders.

Now I've hit the point where I'm questioning my decision after reading posts about people having trouble being accepted as a business major. Should I change and go through with a CS degree or was Marketing the right choice because it's my weakness?

We get along well, play basketball together, go out together on the weekends, and generally just all spend a lot of time together. However, they do not do anything in terms of cleaning, and they are so inconsiderate. 

We run the dishwasher every night and every morning I return from my  :  am class, empty it, reload it, and do any other dishes. My roommates wake up before I get home, eat breakfast, leave their dishes in the sink, and then go back to bed until about noon. This leaves me to clean up their mess even though they had all the time in the world to do the dishes and clean up. 

Also, we have   bathrooms and I clean both almost weekly because they get so disgusting- also I only ever use one of them so i’m cleaning a bathroom comprised entirely of other peoples messes. We’ve lived here for a year and I’m the only one who has ever cleaned a bathroom. Trash and recycling fill up quickly, and again, aside from maybe once or twice I’m the only person who has ever taken trash out. They can be overflowing and people will just balance stuff on top.

Aside from kitchen, bathrooms, and trash, I’m also the only one who will ever sweep, vacuum, wipe down a table, clean out the fridge, anything. The thing that’s been getting to me recently though is how inconsiderate they are. I wake up the earliest out of everyone, but recently one of my roommates has been waking up around   am to work out. I’ve been woken up every day this past week to him watching Tik Toks at maximum volume in the kitchen (yes he owns airpods and just refuses to use them). Also, I’ll get home from a long day, or the gym and see the kitchen is an absolute mess, and my roommates are playing video games   feet away. I clean up everything and they don’t even bat an eye or say a word. 

Also, my roommates parents pay for  % of their things- rent, groceries, beer, new shoes, everything. I, however, pay for everything myself using money i’ve saved up from serving in a restaurant. When I buy groceries, it hurts my pockets, when they buy groceries it’s a venmo request to their parents.

Politics, different cultures/ languages, geography and international law/european law appeals to me greatly, but at the same time nothing seems to pay well. An international relations degree spiked my interest, but I've looked into that many times it feels like, and I'm uncertain to weather I'd be able to find a concrete job post graduation.  


I probably sound like a broken record, but different cultures, languages and political relations interest me greatly, and I'd very much so like a job in relation to that...but I'm moreso focused on a high salary tbh -- my main goal is to travel.

Linguistics was an option - but again, shitty pay that could definitely NOT support me in the city. It feels like in Australia there's medical, and IT career paths, and those are your only hopes at getting decent pay.

Right now, i'm looking into computational linguistics, or doing a business/foreign language degree. Otherwise, I'm lost.

It feels like I've been searching for about   straight years, finding something that remotely interests me, and then seeing the salary/what it entails and straying away.

If anybody could suggest uni courses to combine with a foreign language degree, and the potential careers I might find myself with if i pursued studying it, or even advice, I'd greatly appreciate it. Thanks!

I sent her my version history on Word and showed her the number of docs I used to write the essay (it ended up being   separate docs because of the rough drafts).

I don’t really know what to do, she said ‘If I’d like to contest my grade, she can sent it to Student Affairs‘, but is this really so necessary? With my version history and docs? This is the first essay I’ve written in easily a decade, too.

I showed my best friend a snippet of the essay (who’s also in college) and she just told me, and I quote, “Your sentences have a way of not ending correctly. You know how people have run on sentences? You have a habit of writing like you typed a run on sentence and then deleted have the sentence and added a period.”

This is just very frustrating. I have a lot going on and having to go to school court wasn’t really on my to-do list. I understand my essay wasn’t very good, but I didn’t think it was so bad that she would think AI wrote it. God forbid someone just be stupid I guess (half kidding).

Not sure if I should try reporting him to the dean and/or file a complaint through the school's official channels, or if it might do more good to talk to a lawyer.

The TL;DR is that he's a toxic, fragile manipulator with a weird problem with autistic students who is reportedly slandering me behind my back to other students by saying things about me that he knows for a fact aren't true.  He also actively sabotoged my thesis project by privately slandering me to a vital group member, who went from being really excited to work with me to treating me abusively and almost bailing.

He's fragile about me asking questions in class, even though I do it with respect for his expertise.  He takes it all as personal attacks.  He gaslights me in front of the whole class and uses whataboutism or literally lies when called out by others.

He discriminates against the noticably autistic student, to the point where lots of us are noticing and it makes us uncomfortable.  I, myself, am a little bit on the spectrum, and I can't help but wonder about discrimination.

He plays favorites, hard.  He chooses  -  studetns per year to treat far better than the rest despite the performance of others; he emails his chosen favorites job opportunities that he doesn't tell the rest of us about; he refuses to teach the rest of us how to even find those opportunities on our own (he still makes about half his income off that type of work himself, despite being a full-time professor, so there's a very clear conflict of interest there).

I've been struggling to decide on whether Linguistics or Crop Science would be better as my ""X"".

Keep in mind all this is coming from a high school senior, these are just my assumptions and I have no idea what I'm doing :(((((

CS + Linguistics

\-------------------------

Pros:

\- Pretty synergistic with CompSci like with natural language processing

\- I like etymology

\- I've heard it's easier than STEM majors given that it's a humanity

Cons:- Not much going for it besides being paired up with computer science

\- If the computer science market is still oversaturated I won't be able to get a pure linguistics job

\- I don't know if UIUC has a decent linguistics program or not

CS + Crop Science

\-------------------------

Pros:

\- Agroecology is synergistic with computer science (not as much as linguistics)

\- Studying plants sounds cool??

\- If the CompSci market is still oversaturated I can just get a job in agriculture I guess?

\- Feels like I'm doing a real science and not just studying something man-made

Cons:

\- Harder

She is callous, rude and unhinged, but I blame myself the very first day I met her. I asked her please I would love to have you check out this roommate agreement so that we can know how each other’s likes are and dislikes and make sure that each of us are comfortable, what do you say she immediately deflected and said no you can give that to management I have no need for that. I should’ve realized that was a red flag in itself.

Let’s fast forward to today, where I finally moved away from her after two or three police calls initiating a disorderly conduct report as well as the theft report because she stole my bag and wrote her name all over it. I had to fly all the way to San Diego get a receipt and prove that the bag was mine for them to acknowledge her theft , that’s not the worst part. The worst is management is doing very little about it until I can provide the police reports which they will be here next week but it’s just been frustrating because I have been studying taking care of a not well parent and nursing an injury for the last six months as a navy veteran, who is just trying to start over and do something meaningful so the my  life. i’ve never posted on Reddit before but I thought I would share this cute little video I created on YouTube shorts if it speaks to you please I would be happy for you to watch it and subscribe and follow the journey of escaping this awful roommate. I know he might say well. What did you do in the matter often, I tried avoiding conflict at all times. For example, if she was out in the living room, I would stay in my room. The only time I would come out is to cook, and whenever I would come out and cook is when she would start harassing me I can’t stay inside my apartment and not eat so I would avoid the general spaces so I could avoid her. She always initiated issues until I had to get the police involved. It just got to be too much.

Sometimes you just have to pull yourself up out of depressive feelings and put in at least a little bit of effort into it daily to get better. 

I think growing up I was conditioned a lot of the time to enjoy learning when I knew I could get a good grade on the test, and this is the experience a lot of other students deal with as well. 

I just feel like a dullard, not that I can’t study or retain any information, but that I can’t apply the information or have discussions about what I’m learning. I’ve relied on wrote memory and feel very intimidated by critical thinking skills and always feel challenged even with basic critical thinking. I don’t like myself for it and wonder if I’m wasting my time in college and wasting my parent’s money. 

I can study, but it has constantly been an uphill battle for me over the last several years. It’s really hard to care about reading a chapter on a book or drilling practice problems when I’m  % sure it’s going to drop out of my head within the next month. I’ve gotten my ass handed to me in college and am struggling to get B’s and C’s in my classes, and I can’t talk about what I’ve learned and seem to keep coming up against the same problems. I can ask the professors questions but I don’t want to ask them the same damn questions week in and week out after they gave me a full explanation.

I graduated from high school almost two years ago now and finally decided that it's about time to continue with my life. I have the motivation again, but I'm stuck on one thing: I don't know what to study. 

My two top choices are account and computer science. I took high school classes for both of them, and had a decent experience with them both.

In accounting I did really well. It was largely self taught and independent. It was tedious, but not difficult. My grade never dropped below a  . To say I enjoyed it would be a stretch, but I managed to make it through without complaint. Once I got focused, the work went by fast, and seeing all the numbers laid out cleanly was satisfying.

As for my programming classes, they went... not so well. It was less my own ability and moreso the fact that I was heavily medicated at the time, leading to insane drowsiness, passing out in the library, and more often than not missing the bus to the tech center because of it. I never did care for it, either. I only went because I've heard all sorts of things about it being in demand. I do have a passing interest in game dev, but only for things like visual novels that don't require anything especially complex. Anyway, the little I did attend went... alright, I guess. It was certainly far more frustrating and didn't come as naturally to me. I still got an A, but that's not a big deal. 

I've always been a straight A student, even in classes I've struggled with. I've found that memorization and the drive to meet deadlines is what kept my grades high, and that my GPA does not translate to real world intelligence or the ability to perform well in a workplace environment.

As an aside, I am diagnosed autistic and agoraphobic. I have significant difficulty interacting with others, especially with strangers, especially considering that I am primarily nonverbal in real life. While I wouldn't say that a job that requires face-to-face social interaction is impossible, it would be difficult. I'd prefer something more independent, with minimal socialization (at least aloud- I have no issue talking online).

At the end of the day, though, I would say I'm much more of a humanities type than a STEM type. In an ideal world where most humanities degrees aren't seen as practically useless, I'd pursue my passion in a heartbeat. Unfortunately, college is expensive in America, and I don't have money to waste on following my dreams. Still, I sort of cling to the hope that someone will tell me it is worth pursuing my passion and that it wouldn't be completely stupid and a waste of money to study something I actually care about.

In any case, I just feel lost and confused and want to stop putting everything off. I don't know what I should do. Even if you don't have advice, I would appreciate hearing about similar experiences.

I'm currently in my second year, and both last year and this year, our professors in our majors consistently assign activities like roleplays and singing, which aren't really my forte given that I'm an introvert. (With only three professors teaching our major subjects at our school, we always end up having them as our professors regardless of the academic year.)

I have two sisters: one graduated in BS Tourism, and the other is currently graduating in AB Psychology. Despite this, I'm considering changing my course. However, my family, particularly my dad, is quite traditional and has always envisioned me pursuing Criminology/PNP (Which I don't Like)

Feeling uncertain about my direction due to the pandemic's impact on my self-esteem and confidence, I sought guidance from a friend (who has an experience on Counseling). I expressed my broad interests and described myself as a Jack of All Trades, Master of None. I really don't know Where i'm good at and what I want anymore. The counselor suggested considering AB Psychology as a potential option for me.

I even joked about the idea of dropping out of college, suggesting that my brain isn't wired for complex thinking. In my defense, my friend pointed out that I don't have an average IQ and might excel in the sciences. Despite such remarks, I struggle with self-doubt and worry about the consequences of changing my course.

Will I appear foolish for potentially wasting two years if I switch paths?
Can I truly succeed in AB Psychology?

**I want to start by saying I do indeed have friends.** Disparate friends from around my college that I hang out with occasionally. I know there are people here that struggle with finding even a single friend, and to those, PLEASE KEEP READING, I was in a similar spot, and I hope I can help you through sharing my experience.

So even though I do have friends, I have no friend group. That's due to the fact that my first few weeks here in uni were rough. I was an OOS student adjusting to a town I didn't know, was constantly busy shopping for things I needed, (I was out on my bike riding around alone when I wasn't in class) and had some mental hangups. I still needed to love myself for who I was, and constantly doubted anyone would care about my silly niche interests.

***It was before I learned the key to making friends isn't to be interesting, but to be interested in other people.***

I know that now, and I have zero problems making friends. I ask deep questions that really get a conversation going, listen carefully and let the other person do most of the talking. But alas, it feels like most people here cement into their friend groups during those first few weeks, when I was a hermit. And the funny part is, I DID have two orientation friend groups, TWO, but one stopped talking in the group insta chat, and seemed to split up into smaller sub-friend-groups. The other one stopped talking in the group text even though we did stuff for a week, my fault for not taking initiative and inviting people to do things that second week of school, I was still a shy, low self-esteem, poorly dressed fella.

And so, I got busy for a week, alone, and a week turned into three months, the loneliest   months of my life. So over winter break I spent literally the whole month reading books and watching videos on how to make friends.

So recently when I came back from winter break, I was determined to be social, and I was, I've been inviting people out to get food from time to time and have made new friendships here all by myself, without having to be introduced to them by someone I already know. Just by striking up a conversation in a social setting, and if it went well, I'd take em out to get lunch.

But not having a friend group where everyone knows each other is so damn hard because I NEVER get invited to do anything, I have to do all the inviting. I usually just invite someone to get lunch every now and then, but not having a group where everyone knows each other makes it so fucking exhausting man, and since I have to do all my socializing in different pieces, I can only dedicate so much time to each, rather than being able to combo it and form many deep friendships all at once. So, what do I do? I got over my self-esteem issues, I know all the rules of making friendships, dress well, treat people well, and take initiative to invite people to do things, but that doesn't change the fact that I was a hermit here during the time that mattered most, when friend groups were formed. Now I'm so socially isolated, lonely, exhausted from doing all the work, and haven't found ""my people"" what do I do?

I feel like it's a big ass ask to from a friend group where I'm the only mutual rn, everyone's already got one, and it would be much easier to inject myself into a pre-existing one. I'm just not sure what the best path forwards is for me.",3522,662,0

I got a doctor's appointment (and paid the equivalent of   USD where I live - I study in East Asia), received a sick leave note for the day of the test and emailed it to the professor about   hours after when the lecture would've ended. Their response to this was, ""There is nothing I can do at the moment. Excuses are only accepted until the test starts.""

While they did mention this ""if you don't inform me of your excuse before the lesson starts, I won't accept it"" policy in the first lecture, this is something they told us only in speaking. The actual course outline says students have to provide a medical document as proof - no specified period for when we should inform the lecturer/faculty.

So far in my life, I feel like I studied only for the sake of getting good grades, rather than actually enjoying and figuring out the things I love. I simply chose my current major because of the monetary value the degree can possibly bring me, and I have never even been exposed to the field before college--i.e., never even programmed or coded before in my life, not having the conviction that I actually enjoy the process of programming. It turned out that I am pretty bad at it, I had to drop my computer science major course this semester because I couldn't even get  % of what the professor was saying. I guess this just might not be my field, probably something that I don't really click well with..I am retaking the course next semester, and it feels awful to think that I am falling behind others. I feel like I have been thinking so much for about a week or so about what I really want to do in the future, but I couldn't figure it out. In retrospect, the thing that I have enjoyed the most is math, something that I really wanted to be better at than anyone else. I know my passion is mathematics, but I really don't know if I wanna keep studying it because I heard this is notorious for bad job prospects, and I guess I am too afraid to pursue this anymore. But I really gotta make my decision at some point, and yet I am so much of a coward to pick any option given to me. I don't think I necessarily have any talent in any particular field, nor do I know what I love or really want to do. The only thing I know is that I have to make a choice, and it is quite frustrating to let my time just slip, since it is unbearable to feel like I am wasting time in my life.

So I emailed him early last week asking about our midterm and how to best prepare, he mentioned studying the homework assignments for chapters  - . I thought, okay fair. At the time, we had submitted and received grades for Chapters   &   and I had just submitted Chapter   thinking, it would be graded by the weekend. I also asked him if the new material from Chapter   would be covered even though it wasn't part of the homework and he said it would be. I was annoyed that we hadn't had the chance to practice the new material but I was already feeling defeated. Well, the weekend came and our homework was not graded, instead, he assigned additional homework covering the rest of Chapter   but set a due date for after the midterm.

I've completed the most recent homework but the material isn't easy and there are people still working on the homework even though the midterm is tomorrow. I also have zero clue if I did it right or wrong and will have no way of knowing until after the midterm. Even if he grades it by the morning it's too late. Now, I realize I should've said something early this week expressing my concerns, but honestly, I was nervous to say anything. I have studied the material to the best of my abilities but I can't shake that I should say something anyway because I do believe that if universities are going to charge us an arm and a leg to get an education, the least they could do is have assignments graded before midterms so we can have feedback and study any material we have gaps in. I'm also shocked that this midterm is almost half our grade and we are being tested on stuff we don't even have feedback on.

Now this is where I'd like some feedback. Does this email sound okay? Should I send this before my midterm or should I wait to send a complaint after the midterm? Also, should I even complain to the professor, or should I go straight to the dean? My plan was to send this to my professor first and then escalate if needed. However, I am not sure what's appropriate here.

&#x B;

*Dear Professor \[\],*

*I am reaching out to express my concerns about the current state of the class, particularly in light of tomorrow's midterm.*

*As we approach the midterm, covering material from Chapters  ,  , and  , I have prepared for the exam to the best of my abilities. However, I am facing a challenging situation due to the ungraded homework assignments in Chapter  .*

*One of the assignments for Chapter  , which was due last week, remains ungraded. Additionally, Homework  , covering the remaining material in Chapter  , is due after the midterm. I firmly believe that receiving timely feedback on our assignments is essential to help us understand the material that we are tested on. Without this feedback, it becomes challenging for us, the students, to identify and address any gaps in our knowledge before the exam.*

*While I understand that grading is a time-consuming process, I would like to express the added stress and uncertainty caused by ungraded assignments, particularly in the proximity of a midterm that accounts for almost half of our grade.*

*While it may not be feasible to rectify the current situation, I would like to propose, if possible, assigning and providing feedback on assignments at least a week before exams in the future. This adjustment would significantly contribute to our preparation and enhance our confidence in approaching exams for this class.*

*Thank you for taking the time to address these concerns. I look forward to hearing from you.*",3616,633,0

I of course expected to still owe some money, but the amount was quite surprising.

I was informed that I'd still owe  % of the value because I ""left the  rd week"" when really it should've been the  nd week but they waited until Friday to accept me to make it appear as me leaving the  rd week. I thought that meant  % of  k, which was not the case.

&#x B;

After I withdrew, fafsa informed me that because I left they'd revoked the scholarship, which meant my charges rose to  k, then after a few days my charges were finalized and I logged in to see that I owed  . k ( % of  k).

Hey, so I've never really known what i wanted to do as a kid. I always had very broad interests that spanned across all things from technology, to history, to astronomy, biology, engineering, music, etc... picking a major choice based off of ""interest"" was ridiculous to me, because there was nothing i was interested in doing for WORK for the rest of my life.

So when i graduated high school i decided the best thing would be pick a major in an engineering that seemed to interest me the most. Good money+semi-interesting and engaging major and career. I landed on civil engineering as ive always enjoyed urban planning (simcity and cities skylines haha) and its one of the most broad degrees in engineering.

Im almost certainly going to fail most if not all my courses this semester and i have no idea what to do about it. I want to drop out. Or change majors.

What are some of the things that the average person can do to help the climate crisis, or is there nothing at all? Do you think that it is up to the world’s biggest carbon emitters to change? 

This past year, research has found that faith in the government is at an all-time low. Do you think the government is taking beneficial measures to combat climate change, or is it a facade? 

We are consistently told that there is nothing we can do about climate change–is this true? Are we going to see natural disasters caused by climate change in our lifetime because we cannot undo the damage that has been done? ",1782,306,0

1153,1708630747.0,college,"Really frustrated, seeking guidance. TL;DR

Hello all, this is going to be a lengthy post but context is essential. As a result, I’m attempting to seek legal action against my university but I’ve never sued anyone before so I’m clueless. For confidentiality reasons the individuals involved will be renamed as follows:

Roommate - Joe

Roommate’s friend - Bob

Roommate’s super junkie friend - Gary

So Joe would bring two of his friends over. Every day they would come, smoke upstairs and stay up late into the night going in and out the house. Gary and his friend (who I later got into an altercation with) both sold drugs and did drugs. The reason I say this is because I grew up in the hood and I know certain behaviors. If you’re in and out over and over again throughout the night and day you’re either using, selling, or both. Since they offered stuff hella times that was obvious. But I noticed they looked real scruffy often and didn’t have much so then using was also obvious. Joe’s friend Bob was always in our townhouse (  total roommates including myself). 

The dude would pop in without knocking, run through to go upstairs and leave shit unlocked, he became an unofficial roommate. I spoke to all my roommates a bunch of times about boundaries, taking shit without asking, messes, etc. and nothing really changed. Flash forward a bit, one day while my nephews were over Joe knocked on my door asking for a bandage (for context I coparent with my mom to take care of the boys because my brother passed and would take them on the weekends). 

I went out, and saw a white male with his head split open (Gary). He apparently got hit by a car and stayed the night limping and also going in and out the house, he refused to go to the hospital (which is fishy and I quickly realized he was lying). The next day his family came to our dormitory asking his whereabouts, concerned for him as he was missing. 

Bob who I mentioned earlier (who I got into an altercation with) began living in the dorm. Not only was he living there, his CHILD and MOTHER of his child were in Joe’s room as well, with Joe and his friend sleeping on the couches for several days at a time. 

Bob and Joe kept taking people’s belongings such as food and more, which resulted in me just getting a mini-fridge, but then they moved on to other people’s shit.  

One of my roommates recalled Bob looking into his room while he was in the bathroom and when he asked him what he was doing he said he was “looking for an xbox controller”. 

When my nephews stayed over I was informed Bob was looking at their PlayStation while they were sleeping. There were also several times Bob and Gary would be nodding off in the living room so clearly I stopped bringing my nephews over bc of the environment. 

Then on December  th a day after my birthday, a $  Bape hoodie of mine disappeared. I asked everyone, looked everywhere, and one of my roommates and two of his friends said they saw Bob wearing it. Bob didn’t return for some time which was weird as he was consistently at the dorm since the semester started and 

Joe began giving me weird energy and ignoring me after I brought up the hoodie in our dorm group chat. 
I then did the right thing and informed my RA, he laughed a lot and said he couldn’t do anything until January because of finals but he would tell his supervisor. (For those wondering why I waited so long to report, I felt sympathy for the dudes and didn’t want them to get in trouble for being at their lowest, to me food is food and fuck it. I’ve dealt with addicts my whole life so I just saw it as people struggling). 

January would be too long and was confusing as a literal trespasser and thief could return at any moment.  I then spoke to the dean, he said that he would speak to Joe and remove him but it would take some time. 

Two weeks went by and while we were decorating a Christmas tree, Bob entered the apartment. I kindly asked him about the hoodie and if he knew it’s whereabouts because he was the only one I hadn’t asked, I wasn’t accusing him. He then attacked me and I didn’t attack him back, my roommate and I used force to push him out and he said “Stay right here, I’ll be right back” threatening me. 

I called the police and they said nothing could be done as I didn’t know his name but if I called while he was there again he could be trespassed. Afterwards for   HOURS both Joe and Bob threatened and insulted my roommate and I and claimed we “jumped him” because we both forcibly removed him. 

Joe also called me the N-word as a white male. The threats continued via message and phone call until I blocked them. I had proof, documentation, and screenshots of EVERYTHING. I brought it to my disciplinary hearing, gave it to the dean, and my innocence was proved and I was moved somewhere else. 

About a month goes by and the whole time I’ve been calling attorneys, little to no responses, and I would think I have a right to sue? Just yesterday after all the hearing had been wrapped up for some weeks, lo and behold I run into Joe and I’m under the assumption he’s been expelled, suspended, or SOMETHING. But no, he’s just back to school like nothing happened. 

Crazy thing is after the altercation transpired, my roommate and I were moved, but Joe remained on the housing the entire time (info from my other roommates). When we were moved to a dorm that nobody ever chooses because it has old plumbing, old air, and heat that does not work in the middle of the winter in NJ. It seemed like we were getting punished as the victims. 

Joe was the only white male in our household in a living space full of black and a puerto rican dude and faced no repercussions for not only saying the n-word but threatening us while doing it for HOURS. Police reports, and a whole bunch of bs collected and filed for nothing. Again, this all happened in NJ and I just want help going through with this legally. I’m tryna leave the hood and somehow bs like this follows me lol. ",5991,1109,0

I know he struggles a lot with his mental health and I totally understand that. This past week however, it seems to have escalated. 

He’s told me that he’s pretty sure he wants to drop out after this semester and has already canceled housing.

Hes struggled a bit academically (mostly just getting motivated) and has diagnosed ADHD. However that’s not the primary reason for wanting to leave. It seems like the catalyst has been the housing situation (campus shortage of rooms) and the possibility of having a roommate next semester, as he is in a private room currently. 

Although I think this reasoning is a little odd, ive been supportive. However now, it seems like he’s spiraling. 

If he drops out there will be nowhere for him to live as he doesn’t have a job and cannot move back with his family since they found out he is gay. He’s essentially fucked himself over. 

I’ve tried to provide suggestions (like talking with disability services about room accommodations since he has documentation for health issues) but it doesn’t seem like he’s willing to take advice. (perhaps self sabotage?)

He’s also been posting a lot on private stories about wanting to d*e and feeling like he has no purpose. 

I’ve been talking to him everyday and now it’s to the point im considering anonymously reporting him to our school’s counseling center. My concern is that because I’m the only person talking to him about this, he’ll realize it’s me and this could cause him to spiral worse. I just don’t know what to do. Any advice is welcome.

I received a work opportunity I felt I couldn't pass up and decided to delay completion of my thesis. Despite my intentions, I found myself in the workforce in a new city and new life-focus and never took the time to do it. I now have over   years in the software industry in a career where my peers typically have CIS degrees and/or an MBA. 

I was recently laid off from my job of   years and on the job hunt. I think my professional experience should be enough to ensure I land on my feet, but many job openings require a degree and automatic resume scanning may instantly disqualify my application.

So I want to see how I could go about getting a bachelor's degree in the easiest and cheapest way possible. As long at it is an accredited institution I don't think I care who grants it to me.

At the time Sociology was a great match with my youthful desire to change the world and bring down the systems that oppress us. I was a good student, but I can't say I've held onto much passion for the subject nor many memories of the coursework. And I no longer have any of my notes, papers or textbooks.

I graduated college    years ago, but I was planning on returning to college to retake courses and pursue med school.

My situation was that a friend of mine cheated on my final exam in one of my science classes.
I went to my lab professor since she was the only one I could get in touch with and said that my friend and I was cheating during our final exam. The professor who gave the final exam went on a trip right after final exams and never heard from him again.

The grade I received in that class was an F.
No asterisk or anything out of the usual.
Also on my transcript it said I was in good academic standing every semester.

I never received an email, or had to have a meeting with the dean or academic integrity officer or professor.
I never signed any forms.
I received an just an F.
No asterisk. No weird grade I never seen before that would raise eyebrows.

I just want to know how do you know if it shows a person have violated academic integrity on their transcript.

I’m going to retake my premed courses to get into med school and this has been in the back of my mind.

I would have thought a stop would have been put on my registration after that occurred to see the dean but didn’t and I never re took that course.

So I'm thinking of pursuing a career as a radiology tech but wondering if maybe I'd be in over my head. 

My wife is going to school for nursing right now so I won't be able to start school untill she finishes the nursing program and starts working. At that point I plan to quit my job and go to school full time.

What worries me is that I haven't been in school since high school, so that'll be about   years without any schooling by the time I would start my first semester. So I fear that I'm going to struggle greatly because of this.

Also we have   young daughters. Whom of which will be in school all day while I'm studying/doing homework/ or in class. Which will be nice and give me a lot time to do those things. But I'm wondering if trying to juggle being a husband and a father to   kids while going to school full time will be too much. 

But what worries me the most is the fact that I don't consider myself to be very smart. Just very motivated.  I am motivated to do something with my life and have a career I can be proud of. I work   hour days in a machine shop right now and just can't imagine myself doing this for the next   something years. 

Here's what concerns me the most. I have a terrible memory.  It's awful.  And I'm so scared of quitting my job to go to school full time and then not be able to retain the information that I'm studying. 

  major difference will be the amount of sleep that I get. I get   hours of sleep every night now, and I think that might be playing a major role in my awful memory. Whereas once I quit my job and start school, I'll be able to get   hours of sleep every night, and I'm just hoping and praying that will make a major difference for me cognitively. 

Any thoughts, comments, experience, or words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated!!!

I don't have the ability to critically think, create, and contribute to meaningful discussions. I don't know how to do research either, well historical research.

The thing is though, this course was supposed to introduce me to these topics because NONE of the history classes that I've had before required me to do my own research, very rarely have I had required reading but it was often a short historical article and not three chapters from a monograph that I need to read in   days and create critical questions to discuss in class. I should have skills that I was never taught.

But besides that, I've taken a liking to language learning, particularly Spanish, and it's something I would like to major in. I had to take Spanish courses because a foreign language (up to sophomore level) is required and I fell in love with it.

I am a junior college student at a big public university. I’m in a sorority, which did help me meet people my freshman year especially. 

I consider myself to have good people skills, I don’t really have an issue talking to people. I have great grades, I’m not hideous looking. I have a picture of myself on my profile if you’re curious. I live in an apartment with a roommate I barely see, and I come to campus every day for classes. I’m always at the sorority house eating or studying, and I go to the gym and the library often. I smile at people and I make conversation. I have really gotten out of my comfort zone and I have started initiating conversation more but people tend to not give you much to work with.

I actually do have a few “friends/acquaintances” but whenever I ask them to hangout they often have some excuse not to. I have   close friends here, one is studying abroad right now and the other is incredibly flakey and hard to make plans with.

I’ve joined clubs on campus, I volunteer, and I’m part of a research organization on campus. I’m “friends” with everyone there, but it never goes anywhere, as in, we never actually hang out. We just talk and joke during our meetings but thats it. 

I have friends back home but they all went to different colleges. I actually had a fairly big friend group in high school. 

I spend nearly every day alone, unless I can get good friend #  to do something with me.

There's just one issue which has been plaguing me for the past month or so, maybe even a little longer: I CAN BARELY STAY AWAKE IN MY CLASSES SOMETIMES

For instance: I've already fallen asleep twice in my film class, to the point where my friend had to wake me up to prevent me from napping through the rest of the period. In my myths and poetry course, I've almost fallen asleep two or three times at this point, having another close-call today in which I just barely managed to keep my eyes open. I've also had one or two close calls in my Native American Literature course, and I've come very close to dozing off in my Sociology lecture too. 

I know people will ask questions about it, so let's review some basic details about my lifestyle: on Mondays and Wednesdays, I have to wake up fairly early in order to make it on-time to the aforementioned part-time job. ( : am on Mondays,  : am on Wednesdays.) On weekdays, I go to bed no later than  : / am, resulting in about  -  hours of sleep each weeknight (occasionally   if I'm super lucky).

I am a freshman at ASU studying finance. This semester has been a pretty shitty start for me. For starters, I was not looking forward to returning to college.

I also don’t feel like I fit in with others because I’m so socially awkward, boring, and not as street smart as the others. I isolated myself in high school from others because of this and had   friends. I feel sick of being this way now ever since end of semester one.

Not only that, but I just feel extra demotivated this semester and struggle with academics too. I was always demotivated to do shit. I had a  .

Im also failing Sociology   which is an easy A+ because my dumb ass forgot to do two quizzes. My parents sometimes make me show my grades because they’re paying for my college. Even though they’re not the strictest, they still nag me. I have been yelled at for bad grades in the past though and sometimes threatened to be grounded back in  th grade and before. The day after I got my math test back, mom made me show my grades and she wasn’t mad, but she nags me to go to TA and professor office hours every week instead of tutoring hours for help. She says to go to them every time it’s available and it’s so fucking annoying. She nagged me to do the same last year when I had a great grade in math until I got annoyed. But now that I’m failing, she’s nagging me again.

When I wanted to start college, I believed that I could get a fresh start from high school and be more motivated to do things like make steps towards fully finding out which career I want and taking steps towards it and learning how to invest and shit.

College has kinda sucked for me, and I really only decided to do it because I wanted more job opportunities. I didn’t enjoy it, I didn’t make any friends or anything, just kept my head down and got it done for the degree.

The issue is my parents want me to go to the ceremony SO BAD. Like, my mom almost started crying when I told her I wasn’t going.

It’s worth mentioning I have horrible issues with crowds, I’m hypersensitive to the point where I’ve had to leave events/music festivals and I avoid crowded places at all costs. 

I feel guilty for making my parents so upset. But when I tell you I DO NOT want to go, I mean I DO. NOT. Want to go. It feels like a firm boundary for me.

Several factors contributed to this. Initially, I had desired to major in Mechanical Engineering, but under pressure from my father, I opted for Engineering Physics due to the reputed name of the university I got into it for. This decision created a mental block for me, for instance, every time I thought of a Physics class I was full of negative energy and anger. Additionally, the severe COVID-  lockdown in my home country meant that my first semester was entirely online, followed by a second semester with strict restrictions on campus(there was also a lockdown during the summer after my freshman year), depriving me of social interaction for nearly two years. Moreover, my high school years were devoid of much socialization, as my focus was solely on academics and extracurricular activities, therefore I was obsessed with meeting people making friends, and living a more balanced life. 

While I maintained a  .  in my freshman year, during my sophomore year, I struggled to maintain my study habits, faced a severe mental block in my physics classes, and found myself socializing excessively. I started doing badly in my physics classes(I was a good student in high school so doing badly in classes was new to me), but I did decently in my Math classes. These challenges eventually led to deep anxiety and depression, making it difficult for me to attend classes regularly during my first semester of junior year and I had to withdraw from a class due to too many absences. Eventually, I decided to switch my major from Engineering Physics to Statistics and Econometrics before the second semester of my junior year. Although I am currently in the second semester of my senior year, I have opted to extend my time in college by another semester to complete both majors.

Over the past three semesters, I have worked diligently to overcome my mental health challenges and regain my academic focus. I have also been diagnosed with a mental condition that causes obsessive tendencies, which may have contributed to my struggles earlier on(e.g. obsession with socializing or the mental block against physics). With the help of medication and therapy, I have made significant progress in managing this condition. I now find myself thriving academically, particularly in math and stats-based courses—I even enrolled in a Mathematical Modeling of Biology class and am performing well in and enjoying it. Now even when I look at my old lectures of my physics classes I can understand everything and I;m so interested in it.

Since childhood, I have harbored a passion for pursuing a career in a scientific field and absolutely hate the idea of working a job in finance or software. I also hate the idea of working a boring desk job and I've always wanted to work in research. I want to aspire to pursue a master's degree in the scientific field and maybe a Ph.D. However, I am concerned that my current majors may not align with this goal. I am contemplating the possibility of adding Mathematics as a major, as I only have six courses remaining to complete the requirements. Although this would necessitate staying for an additional semester and possibly taking some classes over the summer, as it could provide me with a more comprehensive academic foundation. I am considering dropping the Econometrics major to focus solely on Mathematics and Statistics. Do you think I should do this?",3557,594,0

1304,1708480002.0,college,"Students should not have to work while in college full time I don’t know about other countries, but in the US, When you are a college student there is a general expectation that you also have a job outside of school. If you’re attending school part time, or you have an easy course load and want to work part time for extra money that’s all good and fine, but the general expectation for students to work outside of college is insane in my opinion. 

The time demand of a college student who is enrolled in  -  units (if they’re going all of the work and aiming for A’s in their classes) is generally equivalent to, or more than a full time job, which is   hours per week. The expectation is that you spend   hours outside of school studying or doing homework per unit taken. Of course a lot of students either cheat or don’t get an A in the class, but for a student who is studying to the very best of their ability, this is the expectation. So if you’re enrolled in   units it would require   hours of work outside of class plus the   hours that you are in classes that comes out to   hours per week. Now I know that’s not realistic to begin with, and most students are not spending that much time on coursework, BUT it’s safe to say that a full time student is busy with school related work at least   hours per week. 

The concept of the   hour work week was invented so that humans could have time to sleep and take care of themselves, but for some reason as college students we are expected to work jobs in addition to a full time course load. Many students have to work at least part time jobs for money and a lot of them even have to work  + hours to make ends meet. Assuming their schoolwork requires   hours per week (which is an under estimate) that means an   hour work week. I don’t think it should be this way. I think that for students enrolled in college full time, housing, food, and transportation should be subsidized. 

For students who don’t have to work, there is generally a stigma around them being unemployed. I can’t count the amount of times classmates and professors have asked what I do for work and then responded in shock when I told them I don’t work. And they even say “Must be nice” but the reality is it’s just normal and should be this way for everyone. No one acts shocked when a person working full time says they don’t have a whole other full time job, so why is this the expectation for college students? 

I’m busy probably   hours per week with schoolwork and classes. I cannot imagine having to work another   hours per week on top of that. It would require me to limit my sleep, my exercise, my self care etc to a severely unhealthy point and I have a very weak immune system so I would end up getting really sick. I sleep  -  hours a night and I get A’s in all of my classes because school is my full time job and I treat it as such. 

I think that my grades are simply a reflection of my privilege rather than my hard work since I’m competing against students who barely even have time to sleep. Many of my classmates claim to only sleep  -  hour nights, struggle to pass their classes, often miss classes and have to ask me for notes, or come to class unprepared and often look exhausted. I have multiple former classmates who have dropped out due to exhaustion and burnout. It’s so fucked up to me that this is just a general expectation for the average college student. 

Oh also not to mention we have to pay tens of thousands of dollars per year to go to college. The system is completely broken. 

Edit: Someone in the comments corrected me. It’s actually   hours of work outside of class and one hour of work in class per unit. So a person taking   units would be busy   hours per week with school related work, not  . Still with   hours of work outside of school that equals   hours per week and with   hours of work that equals   hours per week. ",3901,729,0

1326,1708468560.0,college,"The process for getting disability accommodations is a messI'm an incoming graduate student (undecided where, but it's between   schools), and lord!!

So, I'm trying *not* to end up in the same sort of situation I dealt with in my undergrad years, but it's hard because every university's process seems to be completely different. 

In undergrad, I attended two colleges - community college and UC Berkeley. At community college, I needed some medical records listing my disability and a signed document from a provider saying I needed XYZ accommodations because of it. I met with a counselor at the disability center, got everything set up, and was good to go in a week or two. 

At Berkeley, I tried to start this process as soon as I could - so, April of the year I transferred. My documentation, come to find out, was no longer sufficient for this school and I needed to get re-evaluated for something I've been diagnosed with for   years. Fine, okay. So, I got on a waiting list for about   months and paid $  out of pocket for the evaluation (because my insurance did not deem it ""necessary"" since I'm already diagnosed). Finally got that documentation, got an appointment with my university's disability office, and got everything set up. The whole process took   months and I was without accommodations for my entire first semester and half of my second. I had to drop two classes so I didn't fail them because I *needed* those accommodations. I was on probation after that as punishment for dropping two classes, and that nearly lost me my full-ride scholarship. It was only after my disability counselor advocated for me that I got it back. I very seriously considered leaving Berkeley because of this. They expected me to simply *not be disabled*, and like, it isn't something I can choose.

The same sort of thing seems likely to happen again at one of the universities I'm considering. I'm asking if my documentation would be sufficient *before* I commit to that university so I can make an educated choice, but they can't tell me that before I commit and sign my contract. Their documentation requirements also look a little confusing. It is the most prestigious offer I've received and the most financially appealing. Considering my ability to receive accommodations there *is* the single greatest determining factor for this school, though, I don't want to take the risk that I will be left high and dry, with no accommodations, while I save up for another evaluation and languish on another waiting list. Without accommodations in undergrad those  .  semesters, I sacrificed my basic needs like sleep and food for my school work and ended up in the ER because of how hard I was pushing my body. I don't want to do that again, and I shouldn't have to. This university has nominated me for their most prestigious fellowship, meaning they do *really* want me in their department. But if they can't meet my needs, they can't meet my needs. It's just a shame that I may have to reject a fellowship and an amazing school - that would in every other way be an excellent fit - purely because I'm disabled, though. 

The other two options, while not as prestigious, financially lucrative, or great for my particular field, will accept my documentation for sure. I've asked and gotten the answers I need to make me feel confident that the transition to either program would be smooth. There would be no gamble there. But I'd prefer it if my top option could actually accommodate me and if I knew that before making the decision.

I guess what I'm irritated about is, like, why is none of this standardized? Why am I expected to shell out thousands of dollars, spend months or years on waiting lists, tank my education while I wait, and ultimately add tons of unnecessary stress to an already stressful educational undertaking, when I've done exactly that already? Why can't what works for one school work for others? Why do all their systems have to be so different? You would think I was asking for the world here and I'm not. I just want to receive the accommodations I've always received. ",4099,709,0

I am applying for colleges for the  -  school year and I already have a small roster of colleges I'd like to attend. However, in the unfortunate event that I don't get into my dream college ( CU Boulder ), I'd like to have more backups.

The Creative Technology and Design Program at CU Boulder is really what draws me to that college, it combines the logical aspects of mechanical engineering and the emotional aspect of art into a nice little degree. As far as I'm aware this is kind of a ""rare"" degree because I can't find many other collages that accurately represent the ""spirit"" of this degree. ""Our students gain an interdisciplinary education that integrates engineering, computation, creative technology, and design. Following a project-based curriculum, students learn diverse technological skills while pursuing their own unique creative goals.""

One I did find was at Mines (however it's Mines and I'm not banking on making it in), it says on its website ""The Design Engineering program rethinks the way that engineering is taught, learned and practiced. Through coursework focused on real-world design experiences, Design Engineers combine traditional and technical engineering skills with creative problem-solving techniques and design thinking to create innovative solutions to the world’s largest and most complicated problems.""

Beyond these two my options are kinda meh, uninspiring, boring, etc, which is where you guys can help because I sure need it! I like an engineering program that has both mechanical and creative endeavors, with plenty of room for personal pursuits/liberties. I want to make ""left-brained art"".

I've had this bug in my brain for a few years now telling me my dream is to study environmental science and become a park ranger.

Over the last semester and a half, I went from *loving* college to absolutely dreading it, and I'm having a hard time working up my old passion for sociology. To make it a career, you need *at least* a Master's and I'm afraid I'm not ready to commit to that.

But college degrees considered interesting have a stereotype of low employment, low pay, and high underemployment rates.

Secondly, I don't think my achievements in leadership or academics stand out at all; I haven't won any Science olympiads or led any leadership programs, etc. Is there even a chance for me to make anything happen without it looking like I was scrambling to put things on a resume? 

Side question(sorry), I have taken classes in computer science, and the internship I possibly have for the spring is comp science related, but I've realized that everybody and their moms want to pursue a career in comp science, so I feel like I should pursue something with less competition, and higher chances of success. Would it be wise to focus on something else even if it means making my resume look worse or inconsistent, or should I focus my attention on furthering my comp sci abilities?

I was closer with the principal than most other students, he just liked me for whatever reason and cared a lot about my academic journey. he always remembered my first choice school and encouraged me to keep going. he also mentioned how he'd always wanted to either take a school trip to my college's town or have reps visit, but it's not a huge high school and hours away from the college so it never happened. I was the only person in the last few graduating classes to go to this college, so I told him I would find a way to get the school connected with my college and call him up once I did. I recently talked to admissions and they agreed to give me some supplies for a visit to my high school, which the principal agreed to. pamphlets, flyers with application info, etc. 

im really pumped about this, but I'm realizing I've kind of been winging this until now and I need some advice. I know I want to talk to the students a little about my experience with applications, but I know there's way more to cover than that and when I try to structure this and make up a powerpoint I just kind of blank. I'm going to ask my college's admissions office if there's anything specific they want me to talk about or a specifc way they'd like me to do it, and I'm going to ask my old principal about it as well.

1411,1708381045.0,college,"What constitutes academic misconduct and is this worth reporting?TL;DR. Good friend has a mental breakdown a few weeks before project is due. Career advisor insists on keeping good friend's name in the project despite non-contribution and tells the group to use friend's individual submission as group submission. The group refused the career advisor's suggestion and removed good friend's name from the project too.

To set context, this was a group project involving   individuals (A, B, C, D and me). One of my project mates and close friends, A, had a mental breakdown and was warded into a mental institution a few weeks before the project is due. A has a solid track record in terms of academics and her parents expect her to remain on the dean's list.

Introducing 'E', the career and counselling advisor for A and my group. The family members of A reached out to B to inform them of her mental health condition and express wishes to maintain A's GPA for this semester. The group already has issues with dynamics for this project, with C and D not contributing to the project. Both B and I texted in the group chat, asking C and D to contribute and even allocate ""easier"" portions of the project to them. Zero response from them, but based on both of their Instagram stories, they had the time to be out partying and clubbing. At this point, the project was making decent progress with just the efforts of B and I.

B and I lamented over leaving out A, C and D's names from the project. Ultimately, we decided to cut out A's name first, and decide if we should cut C and D's names out closer to the submission date.

E starts pressuring me first to keep A's name in the project as ""she is still a student of the college"". I refused. While I do sympathize with A's mental health struggles, she did not contribute anything to the group projects. We have modified her workload by leaving her with the easier portions (summary and conclusion) and even visited her house when she told us explicitly she feels better and is ready to do the project with us. I explained that it isn't fair for B and I since we are both trying our hardest to make this project work out. We have already made reasonable concessions taking into account A's declining mental health. E calls me, and I quote, 'cold-hearted b*tch who wants to see her friend fail'. I hung up from conversation.

E realized that she is not going to convince me. She approached B, and starts pressuring her. Unfortunately, B cracks and agrees to put A's name into the document. E also starts infodumping A's personal and mental health issues to B. Subsequently, E accuses me of non-contribution to the project to B despite having zero evidence whatsoever. B gives me a heads up by sending me what E accused me of.

Introducing 'F', the professor teaching the tutorial slot for the project. Prior to my meetup with Professor F, she is already aware of A's mental health issues by E. I explained to Professor F the entire insanity of this situation. She agreed with me, also saying that it is not fair for the team if A does not contribute and we leave her name in the project.

I told B to tell E that we have already sought the advice of Professor F, and she has given us the approval to omit A's name. B informs E.

E tells B that A did contribute, and asked B and I to check our school mail for any documents by A. Both B and I did not receive any emails from A. E insisted that A did contribute, and started pressuring B again to leave A's name in the project. 

It was later revealed that A submitted the project individually.

Professor F got the entire group to meet, and hashed out all discrepancies with contribution with C and D, warning them to be more responsive and contribute or else she will get B and I to omit their names during submission.

After the meeting, I checked in with Professor F about A's individual submission for the group project. Professor F confirmed with us that A submitted the project individually, and reaffirmed her prior advice to allow our group to remove A's name from the project. When I asked if we could see A's submission to compare similarity, Professor F refused, citing potential plagiarism issues for the group if we unintentionally get influenced by A's content. She later helped us compare A's submission and our draft for the project, and reassured us that the content is completely different from the group's.

E sends B a copy of A's submitted assignment. When B asks E how she obtained A's assignment, E said she downloaded it via the submission portal. E then tells B to use A's submitted individual assignment, modify a little, and submit it as a group. B tells me of E's suggestion, and I shut down the idea completely, citing plagiarism and ethics.

It is important to note that E is also a professor. However, she is NOT teaching this particular module for this semester.

I immediately informed Professor F about E's alarming suggestion and sent her the incriminating screenshots. I also informed Professor F about E's baseless accusation about me 'not contributing' to the project. She then tells me to disregard E's instructions and she will deal with E at a later time.

At this point, C and D had contributed to the project albeit to a lesser capacity. I also informed C and D of the situation. We wrote a paragraph as a group informing E that unanimously, we will not pass off A's individual work as group effort. B then sends it to E.

E continues to harass B by infodumping more personal details of A until the semester concluded and demanding B to help A, leaving B unnecessarily distressed.

After submission, I called E with B to set the record straight:

 . I have contributed to the group project in all stages. I was the person who created the document and provided MY PERSONAL essay outline for the project to speed up the writing process.

 . I informed her that she needs to issue a formal written correction for her false accusation as this kind of accusation is taken very serious in an academic settle.

E refused to take accountability for her words, saying that:

 . She added me into a group chat and claimed I did not respond to her texts. Hence, I was ""not contributing""

I told E that if her message was that urgent, she could always drop me a text or email. However, I did not receive a single text or email from her during the alleged week that I was 'added' into the groupchat. B backed up my claim by also helping me visually double confirm that I was not added to any group chats. I checked all of my school communication platforms after the call, there was absolutely ZERO group chats I was added into by E.

 . She refuses to issue any correction because I am 'rude'. For the record, in this call with her, I stuck to only the facts and what she alleged over text. While I might have been firm to get my point across, I'm very sure anyone in my position would have used the same tone to get this very serious message across to an individual who refuses to listen. 

I tried reasoning with her on why a written correction is an appropriate response. My thought process was: ""If E accused me of non-contribution over text, then if proven untrue, it is only fair she issues a correction over text, the same mode of communication E abused to throw baseless accusations relating to my work ethics.""

Of course, that was made by constant interruption from her to the point where B had to forcefully mute E to allow me to finish.

Questions: 
 . Did E commit academic misconduct by pressuring a student (text trail as evidence is available) to take another individual's work and pass it off as group effort?

 . What recourse do I have against E for her (very clearly and reputation damaging) false accusations?

 . Is E even allowed to reveal private information of a vulnerable individual to an unrelated  rd party (ie. tutorial mates)?

Some considerations:
 . Full-ride, aiming to grad school and above. I am mindful and aware that some educational institutions may try to cover up this incident or even retaliate against me for 'seeking trouble' against a faculty member. This is an even bigger motivation to quash E's baseless claim since it also will impact my scholarship if her accusations reach management level.

 . Any grounds to even pursue action since I feel what E had suggested and done falls in the gray area of what could be defined as academic misconduct.

[EDIT]  . B is also considering reporting E for emotional harassment, but is afraid of retaliation since E has previously verbally threatened her.",8567,1531,0

I recently finished an accelerated master’s degree and wanted to see if there was anything I could do about this before paying the $ k dollars I owe to receive my diploma.

During my last two years of undergrad I was taking classes that counted towards my bachelor’s and master’s through an accelerated program. The master’s version of the course included extra assignments and a final paper. However, one semester the counselor signed me up for the regular (undergrad) version of a class, and by the time I realized it, it was too late to change it. This part I suppose is on me but I fully believed I was enrolled in the graduate version of the course for a while.

Ultimately, I did not get graduate credit for the course and would have to take an additional course to complete the master’s degree, probably costing me around $ , . I’m assuming it’s too late to be compensated for this considering I already completed both classes, it’s just frustrating that the mistake cost me time (completing an extra course for the missed credit) and money (I don’t make a lot).

1414,1708376086.0,college,"For those who enjoy their college experience and would say they have a good, active social life, is that more from classes or clubs or parties or what, essentially if I wanted to live on/near campus and just not be in classes and only attempt to socialize, could it go well?(This was originally posted on r/OSU so just ignore any specifics on that)

This is probably a different sort of post than is normally on here, and kind of long and vague but if anyone can try and answer that would be appreciated. Basically, I have had pretty severe social anxiety since being in late elementary/early middle school, and I have finally managed to eradicate that and gain significant confidence now at  . So essentially, the last   or so years I have generally been very quiet, I have always had some friends, but ""friend"" has usually been more of a term to describe someone I'm cool with and sometimes talk to at school or work, and less of an actual friend I would regularly message or hang out with. On average throughout middle school, high school, and since graduating in  , I have only really had maybe a handful or even just   or   social sorts of things I have been invited to and gone to each year. Like countless times I've gone to extra curriculars, youth group, various things that I've almost always technically had friends in, but as far as like ""hey were all gonna get together outside of \_\_\_\_ later do you wanna come"" type stuff like rare enough that I typically have avoided getting in conversations where I can expose that I have basically no friends lol. And also have experienced that whole dynamic of like im cool with these   guys at this group, yet I talk significantly less than them and ik that they secretly or not so secretly all hang out without me lol. My main socializing since   has been with a gf that I started dating literally right after the covid lockdown my senior year, and only just broke up with in July, and by extension ""friends"" that were just her friends and their boyfriends.

Since breaking up, I have gone through an extreme phase of trying to better myself as much as possible, had a job with forced constant social interaction, have worked out basically everyday, and have gotten finally to a point where I no longer have social anxiety, I can actually just meet new people and have conversations with anyone without feeling scared, yk, like a normal person finally.

So I went to OSU in   to attempt to socialize more already, plus being near my ex that was there. However, I still was pretty insecure, no confidence, social anxiety prevailed in combination with classes and having to work way too much for it to be sustainable. I pretty much ended up doing nothing except fighting with my ex, sitting in my apartment all day being depressed skipping class and work and everything, and dropped out  nd semester with no friends or fun to show for it and a nice lil chunk of debt that I am finally almost done paying now. Essentially the goal now was/is to return to OSU with my newfound confidence and lack of social anxiety, finish my degree (still need like  -  yrs) and basically be ""that guy"" that I always have fantasized ab being and now finally can be, going up to anyone and any event and making friends and flirting and going to parties and actually enjoying college.

So the dilemma is my parents (and me to a lesser degree) really think the better move is to instead take a different career path that I am just as ok with on a base level as what I'm going for at college, but I could just take training for it and start work like now instead of having more years in school, making no money and potentially racking up more debt, all for a real ""college experience"" that they seem to think won't be worth it at all, but I highly disagree, that actually being able to socialize and be myself around lots of people of a similar age and interests for the first time in my life would be the ultimate satisfying thing possible for me right now, and as long as I saved as much as I could and got good grades it wouldn't be a bad path at all.

TLDR;

Again sorry for the length, but I guess the actual question is :

If you enjoy OSU rn and have a good social life, do you feel that being a student is necessary for that? Like if I just wasn't in classes but could go to campus, I just simply wouldn't be able to eat in dining halls, go into gyms, or obviously meet people in classes, however, I am  % sure that lots of clubs I would be interested in basically do nothing to check if you're actually a student(spikeball, disc golf, billiards, pickup soccer games etc,) plus obviously I could get into all the bars and, if invited, all the parties, plus all the random events they do at the oval, union, all the concerts, sports games, etc. like do i really even need to be a student to get a social life there?? Or is the combination of meeting people in class, then going to dining halls with them, working on school stuff, etc mainly the actual way of getting friends?",5015,921,0

I ( m) started as a computer science major at a local community college. It was great because I was allowed to try different majors for free as the first two years were free. I ended up getting my AS in business administration and applying to for UC schools.

The problem I have is that I am staring down the barrel of significant debt in student loans to study business economics and I don’t even know what I would do with it when I graduate. It seems practical to instead just do a coding bootcamp for the fraction of the price, just to have the certificate of completion. That will cut into the majority of my savings though, and I will have to start over for university.

The main reason I stopped pursuing computer science is because my mental health was at an all time low when I was studying it, so I wasn’t giving it the proper attention it deserved. However, I have spent the last year or so getting to a strong mental place and I feel like it’s something I’m ready to put the energy it takes to learn.

I am currently in a gap semester and feel like I am wasting time just working. My work experience I am getting has little to no relevance to what I will enter the workforce in, but it’s the best money I can make at my age and with my experience so I feel like leaving would leave me worse off.

One of the motions I recently wrote, which was rather intensive and a test of my skills I felt, was just filed with the court a few days ago and it was something I felt very proud about. Would it be strange or improper to email a copy of that motion to my professor, explaining that it was real-life work product I was able to achieve thanks to their course and thanking her for giving me the opportunity to write motions in her original course? I'm just unsure if it would come across as mooching since I'm still currently their student and the semester is ongoing.

My plan was actually to pursue undergrad program in Culinary Management right after I dropped out because it has always been my dream to open up my own cafe bakery. 

I had intended to enroll in  , but long story short, the program was under review and they suddenly weren’t accepting new students that year as I had planned. Everything came crashing down. Not to mention a sudden downturn in my family’s finances. Considering how expensive the expenses would be for culinary school, I decided to take another gap year while waiting for my family’s financial situations to improve. That’s how I find myself where I am now. I’ve been working remotely for almost   months. Though the pay isn’t bad (enough for me considering I still live under my parents’ roof), this job doesn’t teach me any new skills.

I had hoped to do some volunteering or internships, but it’s quite challenging to find opportunities in my country. Almost every volunteer positions are only looking for foreigners, and internship opportunities are primarily for uni students.

I’ve been trying to find scholarships to apply for since  , but there aren’t many available for culinary students (not as many as for business, IT, or other majors at least). Now with another major in mind, I think I can find more scholarships opportunities. But when I reached out to an agency that helps with scholarship searches, they said that it might be difficult to find scholarships given that I’ll be   this year. Honestly bc of this, I’m very close to giving up. My friends are graduating next year, and here I am, clueless about my future. I feel so behind and so lost. 

What productive activities can I do that could enhance my CV? I’m concerned that my CV might not be as strong as other candidates’ when applying for scholarships. Perhaps I could take IT courses / baking workshops / learn a third language.

I've not devoted this time to my career but have not had any girlfriends or relationships either. I wasted so much of time on worthless shit.

So i had undiagnosed ADHD and depression which i only recently diagnosed and started taking medication for. But i'm not satisfied using that as an excuse. I see people younger than me in my classes be productive and do things i wish i could have done. (Many are working in labs, projects, Ta's, internships etc). Safe to say i wasn't passionate about science or what i studied in, but it's what i got now. I do want to go for a master's eventually,but my grades are too low.

This is because my GPA fell into bad shape due to my poor mental health and few semesters ago. Last semester was much more successful…but not good enough.

I’m a first gen college student and I decided to major in biology (bachelor of arts) because I want to be a physician assistant. I debated double majoring in theater because i want to pursue my passion for acting as well but decided to minor in it instead since I already have a lot of experience in theater and would like to graduate early if possible. I’ve recently been browsing through jobs I can get with a biology degree in case my PA plans don’t work out for any reason and I’m completely stumped. Don’t get me wrong, I love biology, I love the labs I do in my classes and I find the subject to be fun to pursue as a hobby but I simply don’t see myself being a biologist for the rest of my life, I’ve started to see that biology majors aren’t payed well unless they get a masters or go into the medical field so I went into a bit of a career crisis when I realized this major wouldn’t do me much unless I was guaranteed to go to PA school. I want a major that I can use as a cushion that will not pinpoint me into one field and leave me with several regrets. I looked at switching my major to theater while still fulfilling my PA school requirements but there’s also not many great jobs for me to fall back on either unless I really make it big in the acting industry. I’m thinking of switching to a communications major while still minoring in theater and completing my PA school requirements. This would mean giving up my summer in between transferring that I was hoping to use to work full time as a medical assistant to earn pce hours to instead catch up on classes so I can still graduate on time (this plan would leave me with about   credits). But I’m not sure if I should just finish my biology degree since I have around   credits left to finish it and just double minor in communications and theater (this would leave me with around   credits) or just stick with my original plan of finishing my biology degree and minoring in theater (i would have about   credits left and I would graduate a quarter or semester early). Plus I heard that majoring in something that’s not stem based will actually make me stand out a bit more to PA programs. I’m truly torn on what to do, of course I want to be a PA really bad but I also want to have a more broad major that’ll point me into several directions just incase.

im  nd year in a CS degree,not going to say im the smartest but also not the dumbest person,maybe above average.  
the problem lies with my financial issues and the degree combined makes for an unpleasant situation.  


here's some background: i've been financially struggling for the past  -  years.  
took a loan for a car,paying rent,credit cards,dental problems,insurance..etc.

started my degree last year,and got a small loan for the year(because my balance was below zeros)  
so last year i had to pay rent,loans the regular stuff plus the yearly college tuition,so my only choise was to work full time   days a week whilst trying to do a CS degree(which is a very hard task atleast for me)

this stress and overload on myself caused my girlfriend to end things with me because i didn't have time and will(and the money) to do anything.  
even though i managed financially somehow(earned around the same amount  that i pay every month)i wasn't really studying anything,i was going to lectures and trying to understand and focus but never really doing anything at home or the extra stuff you need to do to actually study,when the exam period started, i failed  /  courses on my first semester(plus the gf break up)  
on my  nd semester i thought i was doing better failed  /  courses(perhaps i got lucky)

its my  nd year,first semester of the year,and i probabbly failed already at   exams and i dont know about the next two.  
it feels really impossible for me to actually pass all of my exams and graduate this way.

i dont feel like i'm stupid or anything,but you cant ""sleep"" for the entire semester and then study  -  days for an exam and expect to pass.

if im trying to loosen up on the work hours and focus more on the studies and fail the exam anyway then it was a waste of time and money(because i'll be sinking more in debt) but if i work normally and fail the exams as well it will feel even worse(because maybe i did work a few less hours i could pull this off)  


so i'm wondering if anyone was in the same situation as me, or does anyone have any thoughtful advice on how to approach this situation,because even if i survive somehow this year,and by magic somehow i even manage to gradute,i dont really know how to even code properly,so i dont know how will i even manage to acquire a normal job,Thanks.

1535,1708184508.0,college,"How should I handle this midterm experience?I am a fourth year senior with a high GPA who is already familiar with this math heavy midterm material, having taken the first half of this course before withdrawing for reasons unrelated to education. Before this late-in-the-day midterm, I spent the day prior and the day of studying the material. I was very familiar with it. The previous lecture the professor gave a review which covered the test material, and told us to get to the test   minutes early.

I arrived to the test   minutes early. The professor wasn't there, but the class of   twenty year olds was, and they were extremely loud and rambunctious, to the point that they maxed out my anxiety/stress. The professor came in five minutes before the test was to begin, ignoring the cacophony while I sat in silent patience waiting for the test to begin. He and his assistant passed out the tests five minutes before the test was to begin and told everyone ""Don't look at the test, or whatever. It's ughh an academic violation."" I watched as a fourth of the class started blatantly going through the test, the professor just ignoring them. I didn't look at the test and just sat there confused and stressing out, wondering if I should be getting a head start like everyone else, or if he was soon to notice someone and instantly fail them. 

He announced the official beginning of the test. I am now in peak stress from the constant noise and extreme unprofessionalism. I open the first page, to the very easiest of questions, and my mind is a complete blank mess, every nerve in my body lights to absolute max as a I realize I am too stressed to function at high math in this state.

The professor leaves the room, letting everyone know that he is administering another testing room at the same time elsewhere, and his assistant will be crossing off times on the board for a form a countdown. I proceed to get something of a grip after struggling for   or   minutes and start approaching the exam in a more forced methodical method, stress still extremely high. I keep an eye on the remaining marks on the board indicating the last   minutes of the exam. When I look up to observe there are two marks left on the board, the proctor notices, walks over to the person sitting next to me, asks to look at their watch, then proceeds to mark off both remaining marks at the same time. He announces that ""the test is over"". Then proceeds to say ""you can look at the test for five more minutes"". 

I am uninterested at looking at a ""test that is over"" and turn it in, as is, while I observe my students continue to work on the test. I leave the room.

The test results are back in less than   hours and I have a failing grade. This exam was worth  % of my final grade. 

To summarize, I am sure I would have done well on this test had a proper testing audio environment been maintained, had I made use of the ""extra   minutes"" of pretest evaluation others took and the professor allowed, and had the proctor kept track of the time properly as I had planned on using the last remaining   minutes to look over my test and reevaluate things. I am sure I would have corrected several significant issues.

I have never experienced anything like this before. What would you do in this situation? 

To be clear, I am asking if I should approach the professor, or the department head, or the dean? I am in emotional disarray, and don't trust the professor to provide a professional final testing environment. Am I just going to come off as a student complaining about a low test score?",3577,647,0

I'm currently in my first year studying Business Administration @ RSM. Just to provide some context, I'm Dutch and spent a year at TU Delft studying Energy Systems Engineering before transitioning to BA due to founding my own startup (I was not always able to show up to mandatory classes).

Reflecting on my experience thus far, I've found BA to be relatively straightforward. I've attended around four lectures this year, yet managed to pass all my classes on the first attempt with an average grade of  / .

I don't want to do an honours programme, because they are always about entrepreneurship and I am already doing that in practice. 

I'm curious if any of you have faced a similar situation or have insights to share. Would you recommend doing this if the curriculum feels too easy? Or will the last two years be a lot harder?

I will also consult with the study advisors, but I value hearing firsthand experiences from fellow students as well.

As the title says, I’m not allowed to pursue the major I want. Originally, I wanted to do something related to biology, but the scholarship I’m in (from Luwait) doesn’t allow that since I didn’t take at least three sciences in high school. I tried to convince them by saying that the university allowed it since they gave me an acceptance letter for bachelor of science, but they still forced me to major in something non-scientific.

However, I discovered that while my major has to be non-scientific, I can major minor in anything I want. I was planning to minor in something like Microbiology while still doing my major in Economics.

I would like to ask for some college advice, well more more specifically career advice.

The situation is the following.
I'm from Chile and here (at least in my Uni, ""The University of Chile"" more especially the ""Faculty of Physical and Mathematical Sciences"") if you want to study a STEM career (Maths, Engineerings, Physics, etc) you have to go through something called ""Plan Común"" (A core program), here you learn the basics of Algebra, Calculus, Programming and Physics during two years (four semesters) at the end of it people go to their respective careers, and here comes my dilemma, i just finished the core program last year, and i am between to choices, I'll go for each in the two following paragraphs:

Option A: Electrical engineering, i failed my eletromsgnetism course last year (in the last semester) due to not managing my times correctly, (i took   extra courses, one of the was a robotics class which i loved) I took the course again this summer and i passed with good grades and felt in love when i finally understood the contents.The thing is if i am going for this option i would have very good empleabilty rates and a very good salary but studing this enginieering would take   years

Option B: Astronomy: I have love this since i was a little kid, i remember seeing cosmos (Neil's) with my dad in Nat Geo as one of my fondest memories, and in high school i to study this because the following reasons i was (and still considere myself) good at math and physics, my family is very oriented to computer sciences (both my dad and brothee are programmers) so i grew up surrounded by PCs and i program pretty well, and the last one, i feel very passionate about it. But here is the last part of the dilemma, it takes   years to study and i get a ""Licenciatura en ciencias con mención en Astronomía"" (A Bachelor of Science in Astronomy) so even if it takes less time it wouldn't actually matter since i would still have to go for postdoc studies to basically be a good scientist.

i almost forgot, here you can study freely (no cost) if you are poor enough and had good grades during high school (for getting in a good Uni) and while you are in college. So basically money is a problem if i fail a certain quantity of courses.

What should i go for? Something more stable or a dream?",2498,450,0

I also was never taught how to study or take notes, or do things that seemed to come so naturally to everyone else. It was so discouraging that it never left me. In addition to that, the pandemic which hit during the last half of my freshman year of HS made me so chronically online and used to rotting every day that it stayed that way. I know I sound pathetic admitting that, but its true. My new bad habits, added onto my already lackluster efforts in school and preexisting mental health issues, crippled me. I only did enough to get average passing grades, even cheating a few times when needed. My small, underfunded out of state military school made me feel very underprepared academically and lacked a lot of opportunities and resources other students may have had at theirs. Or maybe I'm just trying to cope and it really is all just my fault.

Yea, I was busy but I liked the classes I was in because they were about my major. This semester though, My days are lliterally from  AM to  AM every day, with needing to do homework and work on weekends as well. I am in a Ethics and History classes, well, History does not stick with me AT ALL, I have known that from grade school every year i have been there. I am so stressed out, plus I have a disability that keeps me fighting everyday, and keeps slowing me down with everything I do, only adding stress and frustration.

&#x B;

What can I do about this? I have been stressed out beyond Comprehension over this. I want to at least get a D in the class, same for Ethics and History. I am sick of every day, all day revolving around work and school. I am not joking when I say I get about  -  hours of sleep a night and that is with NO FREE TIME AT ALL.. Plus my disability slows me down. I am being help to a high standard, and expected to not let my disability slow me down in the world and school. I literally DO NOT CARE about history, it will not stick with me at all no matter how long or hard I study. I hate how college makes you take classes that you do not care anything about, just so they can get more money.

What can I do? How can I pass? how can i get rid of all this stress? I think some of it is that i am doing way to much, while struggling to understand two classes, but what can I do about it? I need a job because I need money, I need to stay at   hours of school because that is full time.

Hi everyone! I'm   and still have another year left before I finish my degree. I started right out of high school because of parental pressure (they told me I had to go, but refused to pay for it and I had no boundaries so I did) and failed most classes because I had no clue what I was doing or how to study, then took a two year break, then got my associates, then had a major injury while trying to force myself to thrive in a major that was horribly run and bad for my mental health for a year & a half, then took off almost two years, and now have been back in school for almost the past year again. It's an online degree, and I'm doing something I'm actually good at now.

The problem is I'M SO TIRED. I'm tired of not having my degree and worrying that I'll still only get these low paying jobs even after I get it. I'm tired of being in school and working full time. I'm tired of homework. I feel really mentally drained to the point that I'm doing the bare minimum of homework and dread doing it.

1576,1708117028.0,college,"Parents who pay their child’s college: will you not pay for certain majors?I had this discussion with one of my friends who went to college for film and I want to know your opinions.

Years ago when I headed off to college, my parents told me they were going to be paying my college tuition (lucky me!). 

However, they wouldn’t just pay for any major. They gave me a list of majors they would pay for, and a list of majors they would not pay for. Notice the wording there: if I want to go to college for something else, I’m free to do so. They just won’t pay for it.



The list of majors they would pay for included but not limited to:

Electrical engineering

Computer engineering 

Mechanical engineering 

Civil engineering 

Chemical engineering 

Computer science

Nursing

Economics

Finance

Accounting

Biology

Business administration 

Information technology.

To summarize, it was almost any college major that was a bachelors in science or something business related.

On the other hand, these are majors they would not pay for:

History

Film

Anthropology

Political science 

Anything else with “art” in the title.

Their reasoning? They went to the bureau of labor statistics and looked up the average student loan debt for each major. Then they looked up how long it would take to pay off my student loans given a certain college major. Every major that would take less than   years to pay off with an entry-level salary in that field they would pay for. Everything they wouldn’t pay for would take more than   years to pay off.


Luckily this wasn’t a problem for me at all. I had already decided as early as middle school I wanted to be an electrical engineer. My sister ended up choosing biology. 


Meanwhile two friends from college went to school for film. After graduation One of them works at a consignment store and the other drives patients around at a local hospital. I have moved out of my parents house and now live independently. My friends who went to college for a liberal arts major can’t afford to do so. 

There are good arguments for why you should pay for your child’s college regardless of their major. Such as you will never get the “college experience” again in your life. But I don’t know if I buy this because my college experience consisted of playing video games and going to Walmart with my friends (rural college). I could do that as an adult.


On the other hand there are very good arguments to this approach my parents used, and the proof is in the real world: I moved out of my parents house and pay all my own bills. My friends cannot afford to do so. The purpose of going to college is to make more money. College is too expensive of an investment to simply go for the purpose of partying for four years and learning for the sake of learning.


But what do you think? Would you pay to send your kid to college even though you knew they couldn’t afford to leave after they graduated? Or would you be like my parents and only pay for degrees that ensure you could afford to live independently? This isn’t something I have to think about immediately, but it does apply in the future if I choose to start a family.",3165,563,0

1581,1708110516.0,college," , turbulent, and environmentally inclinedI (F ) have been floundering academically ever since I graduated high school. I'll try to summarize. 

I took dual enrollment and AP courses during school, a great opportunity and privilege, but rather than labbing with different subjects to figure out what could get me a job (let alone ignite some mf'ing PASSION into me), it left me feeling like credits are a grind to get through rather than interact with. I graduated high school, and immediately went to undergrad for a year, remaining undeclared. I was miserable. Not knowing my purpose prevented any confidence, and I did not feel like I could academically discover myself after classes went online. I then took a gap during the peak  . -  years of covid, where I volunteered at animal shelters and worked minimum wage to survive, seeing friends and family rarely. I wrote a ton, and read only enough. I went camping by myself throughout each season. I was hoping to explore life more as a  -year-old, but covid prevented my few ideas. I lived alone, losing so much of my sociability and motivation. After awhile, realizing that repetitive labor gave me room to understand I'm not utilizing my brain in the way it needs to be (nor was I even considering a future, being so depressed), I decided to return to college once it remained offline. 

With all of the identity disturbances and social science credits completed in high school, I returned to a different school (one of the big  , for context) studying biopsychology (AHHH). My constant turmoil between ""picking something with job prospects"" and ""picking something that's interesting"" has caused me to remain stuck in a pile of glue, somehow landing on a major that provides neither. 

What’s wacky is that I’m basically done with my degree, however I’m realizing that earth/environmental science/ecology/wildlife is where my innate curiosities have always been. I know that an environmental science degree won’t grant me immediate employment, either, and that adding on another year or two will not be a financially sound move (and I already haven’t been financially literate by starting college before I knew what for). I’m too flippant in my interests and am fearful of making a costly mistake, but this has paralyzed me on my gap and I don’t want to remain stagnant forever.

To further flirt with my fleeting enthusiasm, for the past few months I’ve been volunteering at the local science center where I handle the reptile and raptor exhibits. It’s the highlight of my week. I became president of the entomology club at my school as well, but I know neither of these are laboratory experiences that show my understanding of the fundamentals of core science. To graduate next year, I only need a couple more psychology classes, so I have room in my schedule for some evolutionary biology or geology courses. I haven’t quite limited what I want to do in the environment or with creatures, which I know is an issue regardless of if I have the degree or not. I’ve been accepted into some geological research camps that offer quite a bit of course credit, but will also cost a couple pennies to do.

All I ask for is some input. Do I reach out to labs in hopes to gain some experience before I graduate in  ? Do I add a double major, and spend another few thousand towards university? What classes should I add to my schedule next year as masters prerequisites? What do I do to get into the environmental scene after college if I have an irrelevant degree?

TLDR: I returned to college after a gap year to study Psychology but do not want a counseling or social work career, and am realizing I have a passion for environmental science/ecology/evolutionary biology.

I’m ( F) a nontraditional student who just started school again last semester to finish my biology degree. For the most part, it’s been going very well. I have a  .  GPA and I’m working part-time in a lab I enjoy. I got all A’s last semester and have A’s in most of my classes this semester. The problem is with chemistry.

At my college, there’s a chemistry class that counts towards the biology major, and then a basic chemistry course below that one that doesn’t count. You can take the basic chem course if you didn’t take chemistry in high school/didn’t test into the major-level chemistry. When I was in college the first time, I tested into the major-level chem course, so I that’s the one I signed up for this semester.

I thought I’d be okay in this course but I was wrong. It’s been a decade since I took chemistry in high school, and I’ve found that I don’t remember nearly as much as I thought. I feel lost all the time. I’ve gone to office hours and that’s helped a bit, but despite that, the knowledge gap is huge. I studied a ton for the first exam and still failed it. I can try, but I'm not confident that I can catch up fast enough in chemistry to save my grade at this point. I'm very embarrassed that I put myself in this situation.

I met with my advisor and he recommended that I drop the major-level chemistry, take a self-paced refresher course for the rest of the semester, and then take it with a higher-rated professor over the summer. (Taking the basic chem course next fall isn't an option since it'd delay my graduation by a year.)

I’m strongly considering going with what my advisor recommended and think I’d do well with this option, but I’m concerned about adding another W on my transcript. I’m hoping to go to grad school after I graduate, and I don’t want this W to potentially hurt my chances at being admitted since I have quite a few Ws already. Back when I was originally in college, I was dealing with some serious traumatic events that impacted my ability to focus on school. I had a scholarship that I would have lost if I dropped out, and my family told me I’d never go back if I left, so I continued on despite everything. This didn’t work out so well, and as a result, I have a few semester’s worth of W’s. Looking back, I really wish I would have taken a pause in my education much earlier, but I realize that I can’t change the past and can only move forward.

My question is: do you think it’d be wise to take the W at this point, and would it hurt my chances at being admitted to grad school?

I am going to be slightly vague with some details because let's be real.....we have $ ,  wrapped up into this school with a few months until graduation. Don't want to ruffle the feathers too hard until the diplomas are in hand. Here's the story....

My fiancé and I moved out of state so she could attend a medical program at what seemed like a great community college. I am able to work from anywhere and were looking for a new adventure hence why we did this journey. The college ,like most I would assume, sold us on the low cost of the program, excellent staff, blah blah blah. Almost two years into this and we are both so frustrated. My fiancé and many other students are thousands over what the original estimated costs would be. We are more concerned though it would seem as we have been paying most of the costs out of our own pockets. Most of the classmates are younger and have their parents simply footing the bill. If the parents knew what they were actually paying for, I think they would be livid. Since the program has started, students have been required to purchase their own medical instruments which will most likely be never used again as the future employers provide them. The cost of the instruments ended up being over  ,  dollars from the original quote. Professors basically shrugged and said, ""sorry....inflation🤷🏻‍♂️"". Then on top of the ""class fees"" which were not broken down, were charged new software fees, are forced to ""volunteer"" to raise money for the program, had to buy testing software from a specific company even though there was free open sourced software readily available (im assuming professors are getting a kickback, and for the cherry on top, the program is charging a ""site fee"" to take the upcoming boards of $  per students and yet the site is RIGHT HERE AT THE SCHOOL. It's OUR school. Most of these costs have been piled on during the second year of the program so there's not really any backing out. The entire class wrote a professional letter to the program director stating cost concerns and she basically replied with ""sorry, the document you signed said school costs were only an estimate. If you do not like it, you can leave."" She is the same director that claims she searches for grants all day to find funding for the program. A program that just had a brand new multi-million dollar building built that it seems we are all footing the bill for.

So with that said, what do we do? I feel the program needs to be audited but by who? I feel that I can not take it directly to the school is the employee moral here is dirt. Theirs is no accountability, no happiness amongst them, and I imagine if I bring concerns like this to them or a board meeting, I will be met with issues. We definitely do not want to risk everything that my fiancé has worked for.

I have reached out to the states department of education who referred me to the states community college board. Have called the board multiple times with never a call back:(

If a student chooses to take a chance and raise their hand in response to your question, do not **ever** make them feel regret for having done so. Time and again I have seen teachers shut students down in a disrespectful manner, then complain that people don’t raise hands enough during class discussions. 

The best lecturers I’ve had will **always** compliment and thank students for active participation. Many people will never again raise their hands after being embarrassed, and their peers will avoid trying altogether out of fear of receiving the same treatment.

Mathematics is not my strong suit whatsoever, so im just trying to pass the class while still maintaining my A. Thankfully, the class is super easy. My school sucks, though. It sucks so bad that it’s closing because it’s  mil in debt and being bought by a larger university. I’ll be here for the year then be forced to transfer (yay). Aside from that, the food windows, especially for breakfast are so ass and the caf is so gross (has rats and all types of bugs), that it’s hard to eat breakfast and feels like I have to allocate my time to them instead of it being allocated towards me DESPITE paying thousands for an education. 

Anyway, the math class is  am. I had another math class in the first semester that was  am but this time, for some reason,  nd semester classes in general have been kicking my ass a bit and this  am isn’t helping. For the life of me, I can’t seem to wake myself up, despite setting many alarms and putting my phone way across the room from me. If I do the latter, I’ll think I have some time to get some extra sleep in and then I end up missing the class entirely. 

I know, in a way, it’s my sleep schedule dle as I stay up till like  am but I somehow always wake up at  - , still tired, but awake enough to function which sucks bc class ends, but good, because it’s not entirely late. It’s like this school expects you to have a full wake up at  am and go to sleep at  pm. 

Thankfully, my math teacher is really chill so she doesn’t mind lateness, but I’m not late, I’m just straight up missing class.  nd semester just started and I feel like I’m doing so poorly. This week was the first I missed both classes (have one Tuesday and Thursday). Yes, the obvious answer is get more sleep, and sleep early, I know, but every Monday, Wednesday, and Sunday, I have rehearsal for a show I’m in from  - pm and I get home around  - :  and my classes on Thursday and Tuesday don’t end until  pm so sometimes I study for like  -  hours before rehearsal or until I’m finished whatever I need to do, then have my free time.

So, a little background about me, I'm a freshman and it's just the second semester and engineering has drained everything out of me.

I don't even know why I picked engineering, I'm bad and not interested in physics and math. I'm not even trying in any of my major engineering subjects. Ever since I started engineering school, I feel depressed all the time, I don't feel like myself, and my mental health has taken a toll.

What I'm asking is if I'm betraying myself if I'm changing my major. I have this dilemma because I don't think I can become an engineer and pass all the rigorous classes. Part of why maybe brcause I'm not trying anymore. I also feel like I will be wasting a year and a ton of money since I took a lot of engineering majors that wouldn't be credited if I switched. I really don't know ehat to do if I should power through or escape engineering hell.

I go to work and I have hobbies on the side, I've been going out more, I started working out and has gotten back into drawing. I've just gotten through another breakup, this semester and the previous one both involved a breakup in the beginning of the semester and they were both rough, even though the most recent one was two months but still had a huge impact on me.   
The one before this recent one was extremely hard since I was going through a lot more shit at once within   months (  new jobs, obviously breakup, fight w/ best friends resulting in me being more alone, constant headaches, got pulled over for the first time, etc.). The recent one, this is the most I've done with someone (I'm not going to go into depth cuz that's not the point lol) and I know deep down I would be handling it well-- however, I just reached about a month of getting an IUD. I ended getting the one that has the lowest dosage of hormones and it has really fucked with my emotions a lot, even causing me to become depressed/emotionally unstable.  
BUT, in a way I'm taking care of myself, like I stated earlier. But, I'm struggling hardcore to do school work. It was like this in the previous breakup and of course, I'm dealing with it again. But it's just school, I have motivation to do anything else-- Laundry, eat, workout, take care of myself, go to work, etc. I take Concerta (ADHD meds) and that's not even helping, my dad is paying since the new job I have doesn't pay enough for me to pay like my previous job did and in order for him to continuing paying, I need to have my grades @ a B or above by each payment. This time he let me off the hook with a probation warning since my parents knew what I'm going through.

1678,1707948542.0,college,"Should I bring up my roommate's alcohol use to her?Throwaway account because my main account is easily identifiable.  I am currently a junior in college and I share an apartment with one of my best friends here and two girls who we aren't as close with.  Lately, I've been noticing some concerning patterns with my friend/roommate's alcohol use.  The two of us share a friend group that goes out  - x per month and does weekly movie nights/kickbacks where we drink a bit and I've been known to occasionally have a few while watching movies/documentaries on my own, so it's not like I'm being puritanical about this.  Her drinking habits have just raised several red flags for me lately, and I'm wondering if I should bring it up to her/how I should do so. Some examples that have concerned me are as follows:

\- We started out the year with about a half-full  . L handle of vodka that we shared (I had it leftover from the summer).  I had exactly   shots of it as a pregame one time and the rest was drunk by her within the first month-ish of the semester, along with a second  . L bottle that she bought and mostly finished before winter break.  I know for a fact she was drinking it alone because she and I share the same friends and she isn't close with anybody else enough to have them over/go out with them (the rest of our core ""group"" of   has other friends from our classes that we'll occasionally go out with and therefore not hang out as a group for a week or two, but she's more antisocial and really only talks to the   of us.  She's even expressed animosity towards the idea when I've suggested making other friends so she has other options when our group isn't hanging out)

\- She's now onto her  rd?  th?  . L bottle of vodka for the school year and there's probably only one shot left in it, not sure how long she's had it.

\- Last week alone there were around   empty cans in our recycling, several of which were tall boys.  I know they were hers, not our other roommates', because I saw her bringing the cases in the week prior.

\- I see the worst of it because I live with her, but two of our mutual friends have reached out to me to ask me about her drinking because the patterns spill into her life outside our apartment (i.e. while the rest of us will be quite drunk and having a good time, we can still get home safely and be aware of our surroundings, while she'll need help getting home and we've considered calling an ambulance for her before because she's so drunk).  We'll encourage her to slow down/drink water at the pregame/when we're out because we know she's prone to drink more quickly than the rest of us, but she doesn't always listen.

\- She also texts the groupchat about being drunk when she's home a lot more than the rest of us will.  I.e. ""oh my goodness my sister and I pregamed this lazer tag too hard I feel like I'm gonna puke haha"", and it seems like all she does at home is pregame things that don't need pregaming with her sister and her home friends, and then texts me or the group to tell us about it.  I can also tell she's drunk and not exaggerating because the sentences are more incoherent than usual.

\- I checked the level of her vodka bottle monday morning and monday afternoon (maybe I'm snooping a bit too hard at this point, idrc) and she had to have had at least  -  shots in the time I was on campus (roughly  am- pm).  I was starting to convince myself that I was overreacting to this whole thing, but I really don't think I am.

\- She also drinks a lottt more when her boyfriend is here (he goes to another college) and he usually doesn't drink at all which is a whole other can of worms I don't want to open.

All in all, I'm really worried for her.  A lot of other stuff has been happening in her life and I've been a listening ear to her complaints and rants about it, and I try to be supportive, but I feel like without saying anything about the elephant in the room, I can't fully be there for her the way I want to.  Does anyone have any experience with something similar?  I don't want to make things awkward or make it a confrontational event as we're living together for the rest of this year and next, but I am also extremely concerned by this behavior and want to make it known to her that I'm available if she needs/wants to talk about it.

Now in general I see myself working with computers for a long time because I genuinely like tech but I’ve realized that I can tolerate coding, but don’t necessarily love it.

I’m taking a digital tech class (the actual name isn’t important since the professor only teaches tech related classes) online and we only have one Zoom meeting per week. The professor is super nice, but, this is her first time using zoom to teach and she doesn’t know how to use it (ironically). I know for a fact she doesn’t  % know how to work it because she told us that the first week of class. 

Anyways, the class is only   and  / hrs long. Every single week, there’s two students who are continuously disruptive (asking the professor irrelevant personal questions like what her favorite genre of music is?? Etc.) but whatever I don’t think that’s my place to call them out and it’s a good opportunity to practice my deep breathing exercises anyway. 

My problem is that MULTIPLE times per class they unmute themselves and my professor has to wait for a pause of silence to tell them to mute themselves. Last week, for example, one of them was unmuted and was listening to a completely different lecture. So, we all had to wait for about   minutes and listen to this guys other class because it was so loud the professor couldn’t tell him to turn his mic off. Not to mention there is the occasional accidentally unmute from other members (usually not very disruptive). It’s to the point where we’ve actually run out of time to cover content because of the disruptions. 

So, my question is would it be rude/inappropriate to email my professor and let her know that she can force mute people so we don’t have to keep wasting time?

I just went back to college after winter break, and talked with my ex about something we texted during winter break, which was about us. In the end we both decided to stop talking for a while since we both needed some distance, which started no contact between us. I talked to one of my roommates about it, lets call him Joe. Joe got along with my ex but nothing more than that, since they didn't hang out. The moment I talked to Joe about my situation he called her a bitch for what she did, which surprised me and I didn't think was right, since my ex and I ended mutually and never have spoken bad about her.

It turns out that right after we broke up, Joe and my ex started hanging out a lot. This really pissed me off, especially since I was moving on. I ended up distancing myself from Joe to work on myself after said breakup, which really helped me feel better and moving on from my ex, I even ended up making new friends and getting out of my comfort zone. I think that Joe saw this as something bad, and every time try I would start to strike up a conversation with him he would say things like ""no one gives a fuck"" or ""no one cares"", even if i was having a conversation with someone else and he was in the corner of the room.

Then his birthday came up, and he was planning on getting together with all of us and his friends in our college dorm. He asked me if he could invite my ex, and I straight up told him ""no"", and that ""it really fucks me up that they both hangout when i am trying to move on"", he understood and was cool with it. When the time came, I saw that nothing was done for the party, it turns out that he kind of expected everyone to get the stuff for him, which is why no one showed up in the end, and ended hanging out in another friend's college dorm. When i went into our room, I told Joe we were in our friend's dorm room and that we were gonna come back soon to celebrate his party. I mentioned that we should bring the party to Joe and I's room, but in the end no one wanted to show up to his birthday reunion, due to his behavior towards everyone. Joe ended up getting food with my ex, since a close friend of mine saw them. Ever since this happened he has been even more rude me, even to the point where he would make it clear that him and my ex would hang out when i was in the room, at this point I was already over her, but it really pissed me off. I started asking my close friends for advice and they all mention that this is a ""dick move"", and he just ""wants attention"". I avoid talking bad about him behind his back at all time, I just express myself about how I feel in this situation. My friends have seen both of them hanging out every day, and the weirdest thing is that Joe apparently now has a girlfriend (days after me and my ex broke up) but does not mention her name or anything about her to people, but still ""brags about it"", as my close friends are saying.

In May of that year, i had ended a long term friendship with a woman who i had alot of strong feelings for and i was really hurt by it and i can admit almost a year later its still on my mind today.   


Main issue im struggling with is that i have an incredibly hard time with getting going for the day. I dont get up early and eat breakfast, comb my hair, brush my teeth, etc. I literally get up last second for work/school, get dressed and leave. For work and school i have to leave the house around  , i usually get up at  : . I try to get up early; i set multiple alarms and i set my smart light in my room to turn on early to force myself to wake up, but i just end up rolling over back to sleep.   


Then outside my waking up habits, ive struggled alot to be productive and get things done, like school work. Alot of times when i get home from school and work, i should be getting work done but instead i go into my bed, immediately knock out and either take anywhere from a   minute to a   hour nap and i waking up feeling super fatigued and just unable to get anything done. My days off from work and school, I have an even worse time getting up, i wake up around  - am but keep trying to roll over and fall asleep again so i never get up  until  ish. then i literally just stay in bed watching videos on my phone.   


The last thing i would like to talk about is when im actually getting school work done. When im doing school work i really have a hard time focusing, i tend to get anxious and stressed or even distracted by anything while doing school work. Which all of that makes me lose alot of my motivation and i just feel shitty about myself.

My group rarely talks and collaborates with one another. We are a group, yet we do not work together. When working in a group, especially in a lab, I want us all checking in with each other to ensure we know what we're doing. There's none of that! There's always some weird tension in our group. Rarely anyone speaks up or takes the lead.

I'm not sure if it's because my group doesn't understand what we're doing, or because they do but want to keep to themselves. And most of the time, I feel excluded, confused, and misled. Everyone has their belongings on the table, but there isn't enough space for me to work with them. I have tried hinting it to them, but no one moves. I’m always the last one to finish because of it. Furthermore, when I communicate with my group that I need help or do not understand the procedure, barely anyone responds. Willingly anyway. I'd have to ask my professor or reread the steps, which does not help much.

Furthermore, when it comes to results day, hardly anyone discusses their analysis of the experiments or their answers to the ""mastering concepts"" questions from the lab book. Even when they do, I am rarely included. I'd have to either fill in the blanks myself or get the answers from the other group. As I previously stated, we are in a group, but we do not collaborate. I might as well be working alone.

1738,1707857054.0,college,"How can I deal with being different?Hello everyone, 

first of all, sorry for any error, English is not my mother tongue. Also sorry for the wall of text.

I started my Master's programme this month and right now I try to get to know as many classmates as I can. It is only a short programme which worried me a bit before; I started my Bachelor's during Covid and barely met people from my course back then. That is why I want to make friends here or at least try my best to have a good social life after having nothing.

I consider myself to be quite open, though I am also shy and I need some time to adjust to new social situations. Next to that I also have to adjust to a new university setting as I am also studying in another country now, though not far away from home. Like, I can drive by car back home in a short time.

Today after class I went to the library with   classmates and I was happy that I took that chance. While talking with them, I realized   things though:

First of all, finances. Even though my studies just started, I already have anxiety regarding money. I am still waiting for a letter regarding student financial aid, but I am not even sure if I receive some. I got a job in a restaurant, but I rather want to work druing vacation so that I can focus on my studies and social life here. Talking to the others, I realized that they are quite rich. They are talking about the internship that they want to do abroad (""oh they are unpaid, well, that doesn't matter""- internship in New York or Paris) and their former universities which I consider very expensive. Someone asked me where I want to go to for an internship (like what country or city) and basically, I had to say that I am too poor to go somewhere abroad. Although they seemed to understand me and not ask me further, they also seemed to be confused. I am grateful for the support I get from home, but there is still the feeling that I miss important opportunities that help me later in my career. And I mean, an internship in New York would be a dream of mine as I seek experience in foreign countries.

Another topic is love. To break it down, I am in my early  s and I haven't had any romantic or sexual experience, plus I am asexual and have no interest in casual dating or ONS. I don't lack sex, but a romantic relationship as I never had one and I kind of feel the pressure from society, if that makes sense. I mean, even my mom asks if I already met a pretty guy. I really try to work on it but it is not easy. Within the same library group today, they talked about the weekends where they get drunk (I don't drink though I am very happy with that so that is not an issue) and have ONS or how they started dating someone etc. For me it sounded like a typical scene from these US College setting movies, if that makes sense. Others are in long-term relationships. Of course I only talked to   people, but it makes me feel like I am quite the outsider with my non-experience-and-being-single. It kind of made me feel bad about myself and hours afterwards, I am still thinking about this. 

I just don't want to compare myself and see myself as a loser but want to have the best social life I can. Maybe someone has been in the same situation (also with other aspects maybe)? I would be grateful to receive some tips about how to deal with this as I also feel like this is the first time I really have to deal with this in social interactions (thanks Covid).",3451,661,0

I thought I made two friends. Last year was great with them. They called me to spend time on their room time-to time. They never invited me to hang out though but I didn't mind that. For clarification, those two girls are roommates. I live in another room.

But I've noticed drastic shift last semester. They became very close to each other and started ignoring me. We never really messaged each other outside the school like regular friends do so I never heard form either of them on weekends or during the holidays. I tried to initiate conversations through messenger but it always ended with short answers and I stopped trying pursuing the conversations outside of the uni.

But this semester it got extremely weird. One of the girls started ignoring me in person, barely talking to me. I always had to ask her questions, I felt like I was forcing her to talk. She talked to others just fine.

I took a week off when I was feeling sick. Another classmate of mine sent me some study materials and this girl who ignores me apparently told her not to send me anything.

When I found this out, I felt betrayed and sad. The worst thing is that I've been feeling depressed last few weeks and this information just worsened my state. To clarify, I didn't tell them I am depressed. I didn't bother them with that and I tried to look happy so that couldn't be the reason for this.

I don't know what to do. I am alone again. I am in the second year and everyone has their own friend groups. I feel so lonely. I just wish she told me what I did wrong so I would know I could prevent my mistakes in the future.

Hello. To introduce myself a bit: I am an  th grade high school student currently lost about which major to pursue. I dreamed of being Architect but now I’m not sure.

Obviously, I would like to major in Architecture but I know the market is quite saturated and despite having a passion for it - I want to live a higher middle class life. I know money isn’t everything, but it helps a lot. So, I looked into Civil Engineering which isn’t the same but it has a lot of relations to Architecture. I’m aware of its difficulties since my parents have connections to some and it’s a male dominated field (in my country both are male dominated, CE more so). I’m less knowledgeable in this area so much information is appreciated. 

My mom and stepdad did recommend going into accounting to become an audit, but I’m not particularly interested in anything related to social sciences or humanities. But if it is worth it in the sense I would have a stable life, I’d consider it.

And what are my goals for a career? Just something I wouldn’t hate doing (such as IT or Law) , pays well and contributes to society. Bonus points if it can help the environment. What are my strengths? I’ve been told I’m very crafty and creative, I do well enough in stem and I’m a leader in most of my projects. Downside is that I find humanities not as interesting and I’m quite sensitive. Additionally, I don’t mind learning more skills or start things from scratch. 

Any advice or recommendations would help a lot :)",1531,276,0

This might violate rule   for being “generic” or “easily google-able” but stuff I’ve found online doesn’t really answer my questions. Everything says to go to clubs and to talk to the people next to you in class and stuff like that but I don’t know *how* to talk to people.

When people suggest just sitting next to someone and introducing yourself I feel like everyone but me has some innate ability to talk to people they don’t know at all with full confidence.

Our first exam is due this Friday, and he hasn't added the time, nor has he filled out the Alternative Testing Agreement that all my other profs have.

The Disability Resource Center (DRC) basically said they'll try to email him but if he doesn't respond there's nothing they can really do. His office hours don't happen until the day the test is due, and the DRC closes early that day, so even if he filled it out right then they wouldn't have time to process it.

1798,1707772925.0,college,"My professor has said things that are personally offensive, but my current situation has me scared to do something. What should I do?For context, I’m in my last semester of community college, taking my last required course before I can transfer to the university I want to go to. I already submitted my transfer application, so that university will treat this in-progress course as though I have passed it when deciding who is accepted and who is not. The college I go to is more or less a feeder school, so getting in should not be a problem unless I mess up.

The current course professor, however, has said and done things that have, for lack of a better phrase, pissed me off. Course-wise, she will leave chunks of the lessons to instructional videos instead of teaching the class itself. They give labs that have instructions that aren’t very clear, and it’s compounded by how these labs require using a software they have no interest in properly teaching us how to use. Some of the time, instead of properly correcting students of their mistakes, they’ll harshly tell us “No, redo that, you clearly didn’t follow instructions”. Their tests are arguably longer than what can usually be done within the class period window (an hour and fifteen minutes). It doesn’t really help how they make up over  % of our grade, with the next highest percent value being  % on the final exam. But this isn’t the main issue.

When it comes to personality, they have said things that are completely unbecoming of the job and title they have. For added context, I’m taking this class with my brother. My brother is in the same situation as me (last semester, transferring, application done). We’re twins, and we both have ADHD and anxiety, but he is in a far worse state when it comes to both. He isn’t the best at math, and he does not think he’s smart at all (this is at the fault of several teachers throughout his time in school who basically told him to his face he was stupid). This is not the case. I’ve seen him get straight A’s. 

Nonetheless, when you combine those previously mentioned factors, he’s just going to be one of those students who needs to and will ask for help when he’s confused (or frozen up due to the pace some classes can go). This teacher, in the first week of class, insulted his intelligence and how he was the only one who didn’t understand what was going on since my brother was confused with the directions they were giving on how to find all those specific buttons on the TI-  calculator we’re required to use. He has never used one before in his life, and the professor was mad at him for this. One time, after class, they asked him if he was seeing a psychiatrist/therapist for his issues, and of course my brother felt pressured to answer. That is, obviously, a complete disregard for and breach of privacy.

As for me, this past week they made a statement on telling the difference between me and my brother, since we do look alike. She, in front of the *entire* class, referred to me as being the “heavier” one of the two. Me and my brother are ~ ’ , but I’m ~  pounds and my brother is ~ . Weight is something I am severely self-conscious about, and I weigh   lbs. less than I did a year ago. However, effectively being called fat in front of my classmates still hurts. The statement hurt enough that I almost started stress eating as soon as I got home.

I want to tell the department chair or whatever proper academic authority immediately about the things this professor has said. But I’m scared that it will just make things worse. I’ve dealt with our college’s bureaucracy with some redtape paperwork issue before, and it didn’t go well. If I tell somebody now and it doesn’t work and the professor finds out, I’m worried they’ll take that out on my grade. If it does work and they do something, this professor might try to pin it on the idea of me being angry that my brother is struggling (he isn’t at a passing grade at the moment). While the action of screwing a student’s grade for solely personal reasons is both rare and outlandish, I’m not giving this professor the benefit of doubt.

On the *other* hand, if I wait until the end of the semester and classes are done, the same two possibilities still linger: if I wait, they could brush it off solely because the semester is done and in the rear view mirror. The chance of my brother not passing is also there, so even if they *do* look into it at the end, this professor could say it was out of some vengeance for failing my brother and preventing him from transferring.

It’s freaking me out, but I’d like to tell someone now while other students’ memories of what the professor said is still fresh to use as evidence, I cannot let this become a “he said, she said” case. Also, if I wait, my brother’s success is even *less* likely because he simply does worse when he has bad teachers or professors. Should I deal this now, or let it be?

I'm currently a third-year student majoring in EECS (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) at IISER (Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research) in India. I study in a research-based college, and lately, I've been feeling quite lost about my career path.

Here's a bit of background: I recently completed an internship in December where I worked on core electronics device modeling. While the experience was valuable, I found the work challenging, and I'm not sure about the job opportunities and growth prospects in this field. Additionally, I'm uncertain about the financial aspects of pursuing research, such as funding for a PhD. I've heard mixed opinions about job availability in academia, which has added to my confusion.

Considering these uncertainties, I've been contemplating switching my focus to cybersecurity or computer science. I believe these fields offer opportunities both in industry and research, providing a potentially more stable career path.

However, I'm at a crossroads and would greatly appreciate some advice or guidance. Here are a few specific questions I have:

 . How do I assess whether I'm on the right track with my current specialization in EECS, or if I should pivot towards cybersecurity/CS?
 . What are the job prospects and growth opportunities like in the fields of electronics device modeling versus cybersecurity/CS?
 . How do funding and financial support work for research programs like a PhD? Is it feasible to pursue a PhD without worrying too much about financial constraints?
 . Considering my interest in pursuing a master's degree, what would be the best approach: a) Doing my master's at my current college b) Writing the GATE exam and attending IITs for my master's c) Gaining work experience for a few years before pursuing a master's d) Pursuing a master's degree abroad

I'm open to any insights, personal experiences, or advice you may have. Your guidance could really help me navigate this crucial decision in my academic and professional journey. Thank you in advance for your support!",2101,333,0

I’m also vegetarian (and im super picky on what I eat) and they say that this will also present some challenges for me as dorm food won’t taste good and have very limited vegetarian options. 

They are telling me to go to less competitive schools like uc merced, state university nearby, or even community college. 

I know they mean well for me but I don’t know what I should do. Berkeley has always been the dream but now I am doubting myself. Can I handle the competitive workload while living without my parents? 

And if it does seem to be a challenge for me, how hard is it to switch to ucsc or ucr later on from Berkeley? 

P.S money is not an issue in this situation. Wherever I end up going they will support me financially.

I am very fortunate in that I have not had to pay out of pocket for any of my schooling due to tuition assistance I receive and scholarships. I have a relative that works at the school and I received scholarships due to my good grades in high school and my ACT score. That being said, after my first semester of college I knew this was something that I did not want to do, but I have continued anyway because I believed it would be stupid to turn down free school.

Side story: I am currently a pilot and flight instructor. I started working at the airport my senior year of high school, and not long after I started flight lessons. During my freshman year of college I continued to work at the airport and pursue my instrument rating. I took my instrument checkride with an examiner who happen to own a specialty flight school, and after passing, he offered me a job working in his hangar. I took him up on this offer and started working for him my sophomore year of college and throughout this time I continued to work on my ratings. In about about a year of working for him, I was able get an additional   ratings, including my flight instructor certificate, which gave me a promotion from hangar boy to flight instructor. During this time I didn't have much of a life as all I did was work, fly, and go to school, but I am forever thankful for how this opportunity accelerated my career. At of the begging of this year I have also taken on a more managerial role at the school in addition to my normal instructing.

Present day: Now I am in a position where I have the opportunity to fly and build hours and gain experience in actual aviation management, but I feel that I am having to turn down opportunities and focus my time at completing my school work instead of flying or working . I feel like I am slowing down or hindering my career by being in school, which has made me build up a massive amount of resentment and anger, making it difficult for me mentally to complete my school work. In addition to this, from my experience, at least at my university, I feel that the saying ""If you cant do it, teach it"" definitely applies as I have learned  x more through working than in my classes.

We were really good and really happy for   months. I always made an effort to go to her, or her to come to me (its just an hour and a half train I’d pay for her everytime)

But recently she kind of pulled away and I am really upset.

 I honestly think she sort of realized that even though she liked me, she didn’t wanna be tied down to some dude   years older living in a completely different state (I am from her town though in said state, she went to a college in our state) while shes still young in college suppose to be free and having fun. Her exact words and it was devastating to hear but she said she doesn’t wanna be at frat parties and out at school and “Have any chance of potentially hurting me” Sucks a lot for me but I understand where shes coming from I guess.

Im   and have emailed over   universities in Canada if they could let me complete the degree faster by overloading the number of courses per semester, but the maximum overload they allow is just   course per semester and that too after going through a shit load of bureaucracy. 

The main frustration is that is nobody seems to even notice this , let alone have a problem with it. Not a single student. They are just ready to waste their (  years — Duration according to their potential) of time. Same is for high school, how can that not be reduced by  -  years for people who are ambitious enough? Instead of promoting people to be ambitious, the ambitious are gate-kept.  

I am ready to afford college while working minimum wage for   years, but not   years. 

If gas prices increase by   cents, it’s questioned like hell, becomes a national news, but a place where so many years are just getting wasted into inefficiency, the monetary -but not the only- value of which is hundreds of thousands of dollars itself, is not even being noticed.  I just cannot wrap my head around that to come to an understanding as to how that is even possible. 

More incidents: 

> So apparently, it takes   years to learn literally every field of study from engineering to english. Wow what a coincidence. 


>Colleges want a  -year degree for masters,  -year not valid. Ok, understandable, why not just ask the individuals with  -year degrees to take some extra courses to make them ready for the master’s program?


>The last university I contacted would accept a   year non CS degree with   courses related to CS but not about   year CS degree with   courses related to CS. Wow, how logical. 


>There are some masters programs in US or maybe even Canada which do not require the bachelors in the same field but still make it compulsory. If bachelors is not related anyways, then how is it different from having no bachelors at all? To make them competent for the master’s program, they make them take   foundational courses. If   courses is all that it takes to get ready, then why require a bachelors at all?

>Bachelors required for med school. Now that one is actually very logical as it wants doctors to serve   less years in the service, isn’t it? Oh, merit? Is a bachelors the only way to test merit? Can it just not be dependent on an exam +  interview? 

>Bachelors required to be elligible for CPA exams, if you are going to test the skills anyways through the exams, then why require bachelors at all? 

If there is a   year old who wants to go to med school, why is there no pathway for him to prove his passion and merit for it. Oh, would the   year old not be competent enough to handle the load? Well, then he won’t pass the exam and interview anyways. That’s for merit to decide, not you. 

Again, the main problem/frustration is not what’s mentioned above but that nobody even seems to even notice this illogical gatekeeping.

These are the things I cannot wrap my head around and request them to be explained to me as to how frustrating this all is.

EDIT: Now a thing that would actually be practical is to allow people to view prerecorded lectures online and then give exam to prove competency. Okay okay, now before you go on, I know education is much more than just gaining knowledge, it’s about being provided with feedback and supervision on each and every step. It’s about teaching how to approach a problem and not just give a formula. It is about teaching how to think, perform analysis, and then supervising at each and every step as to how to approach it. But that doesn’t happen in the universities anyways. It’s more lecture driven rather than discussion nor it is much in depth. So if there isn’t any of that anyways, why not just let people view lectures online and give exams? And the score on those exams could be used to let people get enrolled for pre-doc because thats a thing that cannot be done by prerecorded lectures anyways. Then pre-doc for PHD. ",4154,735,0

I was initially at university doing Biology Pre-Pharmacy, I’m now in my second semester at a community college as undecided. Huge shift. I know. 

When I was at university, I was working around  -  hours a week. Most days I would go to school from  :  AM -  :  PM because I would be studying for an upcoming exam or quiz. I didn’t have a life. I was tired and frustrated all the time. I ended up with straight A’s but I was also sleep deprived, practically failing the first two months, and beyond stressed. I worked my ass off for those A’s. Ultimately, I decided I didn’t like how I was feeling and switched out of the school completely to save money until I finalized a decision on what to do with my life. 

Fast forward to today, I’m a liberal arts major (Undecided), I’m currently in between Business Analytics, initially thought of pursuing this major but am genuinely terrified of the results. All I’ve ever heard was business was insecure and there’s always difficulties establishing yourself and getting a job after. So that’s really demotivating, and I’m not sure if I want to dedicate time to a useless degree. My second option was going back into the health field. But this time instead of a Biology degree and then later pursing a graduate education. I was thinking of nursing. I know nothing about nursing. I have a couple nurses in the family. All I know is that the schooling is incredibly stressful as well and that I’ll basically be back at square one studying all day with no real life to live. 

I want to point out a couple of side notes. I’m incredibly terrified of failure. If I pursue nursing, I know it’s very easy to get kicked out of the program if you even fail one course. At least in a ASN program. I’m not really sure how the BSN works. The only positive side I could see from nursing is the job security once the schooling is over. 

I also want to note that I’ve taken dozens of career tests and they’ve all said management careers. The only problem is again. There’s no job security in business. I’ve taken a personality test as well if that helps, my result was ESFP-T personality. 

Ultimately, I’m lost. I have till late March to officially decide on a major according to the school. Does anyone have advice? Please let me know. And thank you.",2440,441,0

Hello! I'm an artist studying animation, I'm   years old, and I've started to consider dropping out of university.

I feel like I'm progressing very slowly, that learning online has helped me much more than university, and of course, I feel that the best way to get a job is through contacts rather than a university degree. Additionally, the economy at home is very difficult. I've thought about starting an online business and continuing to work on my artistic career (in fact, currently, my main income comes from art commissions). I've thought about creating multiple income streams such as investments, e-commerce, dropshipping, and merchandising for my brand, among other things.

But university not only consumes my time, I feel like I'm not learning anything valuable, and it's only holding me back from progressing in what I want to do. The only thing that interests me is the opportunity to go to Canada for their programs.

The problem with university is that it's an additional expense, so I need to use time to develop a stable source of income to pay for it. However, dedicating time to that means neglecting university, so it's a never-ending cycle. As they say, 'the more you take on, the less you achieve.'

Honestly, I feel that dropping out of university and taking the path of self-directed learning, networking, and developing my own sources of income sounds more promising.

Now I'm a senior at university, and everything feels so much harder. I have had little support at the university I go to with my accommodations, and even through I'm taking   classes and I'm very passionate about my degree, I'm failing all of them.

There are a couple of things that happened to me recently that are very difficult to go through. The first being that I ended an unhealthy relationship (that's a very long story) and then one of my siblings that I'm very close to and is very supportive of me is moving really far for a job.

I'm full time doing   credits at a community college with plans to move to an instate university in the fall. I'm also doing another   credits at the university I want to attend. The class is an entry level class for electrical engineering.

Now to the problem, I'm   weeks in and this class has been awful. There's very minimal support for online students and the programs/concepts feel impossible to work with. Im sinking more time trying to get this   credit class than i am in my   credit physics class. I dont feel like im going to pass this class, moreover, I no longer feel like electrical is a good fit for me. This class has single handedly made me want to switch to a different branch of engineering. 
I want to withdraw. However, since it's the only class I'm taking at the university withdrawing means doing a semester withdrawal not just a class withdrawal. I'd still be doing   credits at the community college though. Worst of all, since I've decided to pursue a different branch of engineering, this class doesn't even count for my degree.
