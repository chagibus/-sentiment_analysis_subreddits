1,1708898838.0,"There is nothing wrong with subscription services, just the people who are choosing to buy them.","There is nothing wrong with subscription services. The issue is usually when people are grabbing all of them and never canceling.

A bit of background: I am subscribed to Amazon Prime, Costco, Max, and a local gym.

Subscription serves have been around for a long time, and no one used to complain. They just need to be worth their value to be worth it. For example, Costco has basically been a subscription service for decades. Yet you get your value in your subscription by the money you save by buying in bulk and all the sales. Another example of a good subscription service that has been around for a long time is Amazon Prime. If you are using Amazon frequently then it is worth it to have Prime for the quicker shipping.

The problem most people run into is when they are subscribing to services and not really using them. Which any person who is a normal adult can manage their money going in and out. 

When it comes to the streaming services, I much like this model over cable. I can pick and choose which streaming service I want to watch things from while not being subscribed to anything else. Right now I am working through Max content, and when I am ready for Disney+ I will pick that up for a few months and then cancel it. I dropped Netflix last year and will likely not pick it up again for another few years at this rate.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**: Subscription services are overall good if you can manage yourself and make sure you cancel them when you don't need them.",unpopularopinion

3,1708898349.0,Ultimate Spiderman is the best spiderman,"Post is flagged with ""Spoiler"" because I kind of spoil the show ""Ultimate Spiderman"" a little bit on the post, so be aware of that

Most people say Tobey's Spiderman is the best live action Spiderman, and Spectacular is the best cartoon Spiderman, but I come here to digress. Ultimate Spiderman from the disney show is far better than any other version of spiderman i've ever seen. I know this is a really bold take, but this is the correct subreddit for this I think.

Most people really dislike the Ultimate Spiderman show, but I love it. The jokes are all awesome I don't think a single one of them is particularly bad, most are funny. The overall plot gets better throughout the seasons, and I love the Spiderverse episodes and Ultimate Goblin. I think the finale was perfect for the show also.

Overall, when I see Spiderman, this is the kind of spidey I want to see. Funny, making jokes mid battle, breaking the 4th wall. Serious at times when the plot demands it. Tobey doesn't make good jokes and Spectacular isn't on the level of Ultimate.

Tom Holland's Spiderman had a lot of potential but unfortunately they were held back by the other Spiderman movie series(Sam Raimi's and TASM) so they couldn't do something like a Spiderman: The Sinister Six movie which is what I wanted instead of No Way Home

IMO the 2nd best Spiderman is probably Insomniac's from the Marvel's Spiderman games, but that might be because they actually *did* get to do the Sinister Six thing, and it's hard for me to rate only the character forgetting that part. Oh also, Ultimate Spiderman also has several episodes where the Sinister Six come together, and also has in my opinion the best version of Carnage so far. I also love some of the side characters like Nova, Power Man and Agent Venom(Flash Thompson in this show).

I understand why some people may disagree, as they've grown up with more serious versions of the character, but I prefer light hearted spidey 90% of the time, and the other 10%, the same spidey but serious, like in the part where Ben Reilly(Scarlet Spider) reveals Peter's identity to Doc Ock

5,1708898110.0,Michael Jackson was most likely innocent,"Unsurprisingly a lot of people seem to have strong opinions about this issue. I've watched many documentaries from both sides and it seems to me none of the accusations hold much water.   
Michael Jackson didn't pay Jordan Chandler anything, his insurance company did. It was their choice, not Michael's. The settlement didn't prevent Jordan from testifying in criminal court, he just simply refused to. Jordan's own mother seems to think MJ was innocent and according to rumors Jordan himself has said his dad made him lie about those things and it was all for the money. The Leaving Neverland -documentary is filled with nonsense, like for example they claim he somehow committed crimes in Paris disneyland and Neverland train station years before they were even built.

And then there are some movies and series that seem to ignore that besides this symbolism, you need a structure that doesn't depend on it to remain solid. I can name a few series like that here: Midsommar, Hereditary, Evangelion, Zima Blue (episode from ""Love, Death & Robots""), some episodes of Black Mirror.  
  
  
And when you try to understand why the person liked the movie, they usually talk about a thousand and one things that the movie represents, but the movie itself seems to become secondary in the discussion. If they don't say the infamous quote ""Too deep for you."".",unpopularopinion

I am a strong believer that people should be selfish.

I think people should stop demonizing the word and learn to embrace it as means of self-love and self-care.

54,1708814648.0,Git is needlessly complicated,"Git is an extremely useful tool to use when working on any kind of project but for the last 19 years it's been used almost exclusively by software developers. Git is not inherently limited to software projects and can be used as version control for really anything that involves storing files on a computer. Version control software, such as Git, should be as commonly understood by everyday computer users as internet browsers and antivirus software. Git's learning curve is unnecessary and is the main reason why it is not used by everyone. 

Take the command line for example, open up an internet browser and search ""git tutorial"" or ""how to get started with git"". Every tutorial starts by explaining how to use Git's command line interface. I understand that entering commands into a terminal is not technically ""coding"", but to the average person, it looks effectively the same. It's a significant entry barrier that discourages people unfamiliar with the concept to put in the effort to learn it. No other software commonly used by non-software developers requires the user to use the command line for every task. Imagine having to type `word save report.docx` in a terminal window every time you wanted to save in Microsoft Word, or `google revert` to go back a page in Google Chrome. I cannot understand why it is still the default way to interact with Git when it could easily be made to be more user friendly. 

For example, I often use the program ""7-zip"" to compress and decompress files. 7-zip has a command line interface. If I wanted to I could type `7z a` [`file.zip`](https://file.zip) `file.txt` in a terminal window to compress file.txt. However, this is not the default method and does not show up on the first page of a google search. Instead, I can right-click on file.txt in my file explorer, scroll down to 7-Zip in the pop-up menu, and select ""7-Zip > Add to [file.zip](https://file.zip)"". Alternatively, I could use the user-interface that comes pre-installed with 7-zip and compress it from there. Both methods are intuitive and do not require any typing. I don't understand why it's not possible to commit by right-clicking on a Git repository open in file explorer and selecting ""Git > Commit"" in the pop-up menu, or to add a file to the git index by selecting ""Git > Add"". 

I am aware that Git comes pre-installed with Git GUI on Windows, but it looks like it was made in a day using Tkinter. There's no reason for Git not to include a clean, user-friendly graphical interface as part of its default package. I am also aware there are third-party programs like GitKraken that provide a intuitive user-interface. However, the average person is likely deterred before even considering searching for a third-party solution.

To me, Git has always had a strange aura of gate-keeping around it, where it seems intentionally kept needlessly complicated. While it's not difficult to use once you get the hang of it, the initial complexity is kept in to make those who use it feel smarter than the average computer user. 

It's a true shame that Git is not widely accepted as the defacto version control software. Instead, software for non-programmers often have their own built-in VCS. Imagine if Microsoft Office had built in Git support like Visual Studio does? You could create a repository for a class and manage versions for notes, assignments, projects, etc from Word or Powerpoint.

If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read my mini-rant. I'm sure you're all ready to tell me how Git is actually intuitive and I'm just a slow learner in the comments lol.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Git is extremely useful tool for any type of project but its needless complexity makes it scary for people unfamiliar with software development to learn and use.

73,1708736636.0,Limited editions/first print editions make no sense economically.,"I get it, having something that you can't get anymore is cool, but that's it...

I can't find a reason why companies choose to artificially limit their stock with products that people can, and will buy.   
Be it the NES/SNES mini, physical collectors' editions for games, art books, dakimakura covers, or literally anything else. There is no reason to not simply offer those items  on-demand after the campaign is over, and if they have a high production cost, the company can just up the price to the point it becomes profitable to sell them, it's not like that's gonna stop the people who really want it.  
I also have a similar opinion on products that are no longer manufactured like old consoles, phones, televisions etc., but that's besides the point of this post.

Now we get to digital limited editions/pre-order exclusive content...  
This is just plain idiocy. It's not like they can simply add said things as DLC, no. They need to sell to you the ""exclusivity"" of having a couple extra lines of code in the game you bought. Or, just having a couple of PNGs that apparently constitute as an ""Art book"".  
There is no way to limit digital content, people are going to either leak it (in the case of things that are standalone), or mod it into the software.

Now, for the conclusion, there is one type of artificial scarcity that I don't have as much of a problem with, and that's backer exclusive physical goods.  
This is because the people who get said products actually helped the project that they backed come into fruition. It is the way that the people who received crowdfunding thank their supporters, that believed in the project that was proposed. It's the way they can say ""It's thanks to you that we got this far.""

There‚Äôs so much more to the country than just London. I‚Äôve spent most of my life travelling around the UK and I think England ticks the boxes for most of the things people praise other countries for. 

You can get a surprisingly diverse experience as you travel around the country, and so I believe that most people can find something they like about it. 

Countless towns and regions have their own cultural identities, ways of life, dialects/accents, food traditions, architecture, and genetic makeup. There‚Äôs a varied mix of cities and towns- from charming historic to modern planned towns, industrial eyesores, etc. Anything you could possibly want. 

There‚Äôs a good mix of ancient and modern - interesting history is found on almost every corner spanning thousands of years that we can learn a lot of lessons from. But there‚Äôs also great nightlife, shopping, entertainment, developed infrastructure, etc.

The countryside is beautiful - lush green and tranquil. The number of walking/hiking trails is pretty remarkable and easily accessible, and there‚Äôs also an extensive rugged coastline to explore. 

The country just has a lot to offer and I shake my head at how the national image has been reduced to Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, football, and binge drinking whilst other countries receive praise for their range of culture, heritage, landscapes, etc.

95,1708638991.0,Blended foot is better and more convenient than unblended food.,"Recently, I had the unfortunate experience of losing all my teeth, which required me to blend all my food and drink it through one of those large bubble tea straws. I won't get into how I lost my teeth because it's embarassing and not the point of this discussion, so don't ask.

But anyways, at first it was gross but now that I'm used to it, I think it is superior than the normal method of consumption. It's less messy, you don't need utensils, and it's way easier and portable and it just tastes better. I no longer have to waste time eating breakfast, I can just blend it up and drink it along with my coffee on the way to work. Same for lunch and dinner. I don't need to carry a lunchbox, just a cup. I feel like it's easier to digest and I no longer have to deal with constipiasion, although I do admit that this diet does give me the squirts. That's the only downside. Still, the body does not need to waste energy breaking down the food, since it's already been broken down, therefore I have excess energy for other things like brainpower and muscle building. I'm not a sciencetist or anything, but just think about it, the logic makes sense, right? Anyways, I digress.  In summary, blended food is:

* more convinient
* easier to digest
* tastes better once you get used to the texture
* makes it easier to eat healthy foods you don't like, like brocolli and eggplant
* can mix with sodas and coffee, or gatorade if you're exercising and need energy
* is better overall

98,1708614792.0,There's too much singing on modern mainstream animation.,"In general, there's nothing wrong with a musical animated show/movie. Some of my favorite shows like Bob's Burgers, the Simpsons, and Morel Oral have musical episodes, or devote time specifically for the characters to sing. It can be fun, especially if the voice actors can sing.  
  
That being said, there really should be less of it. There should be more adult animated shows that don't do songs every episode. Animated kid's shows/movies don't have to end in a dance party or sing to progress the plot. It seems like a factory standard to do it that way. (Especially in the West.)  
  
The Into the Spiderverse series is a great example of using music to enhance the experience. Miles singing along with the first song then not again for the rest of the movie was fun! It was a hint of his character, and we still got to experience the music! It's just one example, but there could be more that's done to keep music in without adding singing. 

It kind of seeps into indy animation as well. It's as though you can't have anything mainstream (or for general audiences) without it having the musical type progression.

99,1708582899.0,Darth Vader is an exemplary leader,"Everyone thinks of Darth Vader as the ruthless bad guy who kills everyone who opposes him. But he actually shows very strong leadership traits:

* While he is the most powerful individual in the Galactic Empire after the emperor, he does not lead from an ivory tower. He gets his hand dirty. A rebel fleet is attacking the Death Star? Not only he is in a fighter with his fellow pilots, he actually shoots down most of the enemy ships himself. He is in there to capture rebel leaders, to fight Obi Wan Kenobi, etc. He could very simply have sent a bunch of grunts, but instead he is in the action.
* He is humble and does not tolerate arrogance and bullshit. When everyone is bragging how badass the Death Star is, he brings everyone down to earth and remembers how it is insignificant in the grand scheme of things. And he was right.
* He is resourceful. He doesn't care about hiring bounty hunters, which the empire leadership considers ""scum"". He does what needs to be done to get the job done, and in that case, the job got done.
* He does not tolerate incompetence among people who were put in a leadership position. When he chokes the generals to death, it is not because of pure villainy. It is because his general's bad decisions put unnecessary risk to empire , like alerting the rebels the Empire is coming to Hoth (which required a ground assault, costing men's lives).
* He also takes the time to go personally to the guy who is building the new Death Star to warn him ""our boss is pissed,  you'd better go back to schedule"". He is a bro trying to help his buddy before it is too late.
* On the other hand he promotes individuals who are smart. Like the dude who read a strange signal from the probe droid which might have indicated the rebel base was in Hoth.

101,1708898838.0,"There is nothing wrong with subscription services, just the people who are choosing to buy them.","There is nothing wrong with subscription services. The issue is usually when people are grabbing all of them and never canceling.

A bit of background: I am subscribed to Amazon Prime, Costco, Max, and a local gym.

Subscription serves have been around for a long time, and no one used to complain. They just need to be worth their value to be worth it. For example, Costco has basically been a subscription service for decades. Yet you get your value in your subscription by the money you save by buying in bulk and all the sales. Another example of a good subscription service that has been around for a long time is Amazon Prime. If you are using Amazon frequently then it is worth it to have Prime for the quicker shipping.

The problem most people run into is when they are subscribing to services and not really using them. Which any person who is a normal adult can manage their money going in and out. 

When it comes to the streaming services, I much like this model over cable. I can pick and choose which streaming service I want to watch things from while not being subscribed to anything else. Right now I am working through Max content, and when I am ready for Disney+ I will pick that up for a few months and then cancel it. I dropped Netflix last year and will likely not pick it up again for another few years at this rate.

103,1708898349.0,Ultimate Spiderman is the best spiderman,"Post is flagged with ""Spoiler"" because I kind of spoil the show ""Ultimate Spiderman"" a little bit on the post, so be aware of that

Most people say Tobey's Spiderman is the best live action Spiderman, and Spectacular is the best cartoon Spiderman, but I come here to digress. Ultimate Spiderman from the disney show is far better than any other version of spiderman i've ever seen. I know this is a really bold take, but this is the correct subreddit for this I think.

Most people really dislike the Ultimate Spiderman show, but I love it. The jokes are all awesome I don't think a single one of them is particularly bad, most are funny. The overall plot gets better throughout the seasons, and I love the Spiderverse episodes and Ultimate Goblin. I think the finale was perfect for the show also.

Overall, when I see Spiderman, this is the kind of spidey I want to see. Funny, making jokes mid battle, breaking the 4th wall. Serious at times when the plot demands it. Tobey doesn't make good jokes and Spectacular isn't on the level of Ultimate.

Tom Holland's Spiderman had a lot of potential but unfortunately they were held back by the other Spiderman movie series(Sam Raimi's and TASM) so they couldn't do something like a Spiderman: The Sinister Six movie which is what I wanted instead of No Way Home

IMO the 2nd best Spiderman is probably Insomniac's from the Marvel's Spiderman games, but that might be because they actually *did* get to do the Sinister Six thing, and it's hard for me to rate only the character forgetting that part. Oh also, Ultimate Spiderman also has several episodes where the Sinister Six come together, and also has in my opinion the best version of Carnage so far. I also love some of the side characters like Nova, Power Man and Agent Venom(Flash Thompson in this show).

I understand why some people may disagree, as they've grown up with more serious versions of the character, but I prefer light hearted spidey 90% of the time, and the other 10%, the same spidey but serious, like in the part where Ben Reilly(Scarlet Spider) reveals Peter's identity to Doc Ock

Michael Jackson didn't pay Jordan Chandler anything, his insurance company did. It was their choice, not Michael's.

The more muted colors from cel-animated stuff and a lot of digitally animated stuff from the 2000s(FOP S1, Ren and Stimpy, Danny Phantom, Animaniacs) look a lot nicer than most cartoons nowadays. Mind you, there are stuff I like the color palettes for that came out in recent years. Lupin the 3rd Part IV looks nice color-wise, and I enjoy the recent Dragon Ball stuff from Shintani recently(ex.

154,1708814648.0,Git is needlessly complicated,"Git is an extremely useful tool to use when working on any kind of project but for the last 19 years it's been used almost exclusively by software developers. Git is not inherently limited to software projects and can be used as version control for really anything that involves storing files on a computer. Version control software, such as Git, should be as commonly understood by everyday computer users as internet browsers and antivirus software. Git's learning curve is unnecessary and is the main reason why it is not used by everyone. 

Take the command line for example, open up an internet browser and search ""git tutorial"" or ""how to get started with git"". Every tutorial starts by explaining how to use Git's command line interface. I understand that entering commands into a terminal is not technically ""coding"", but to the average person, it looks effectively the same. It's a significant entry barrier that discourages people unfamiliar with the concept to put in the effort to learn it. No other software commonly used by non-software developers requires the user to use the command line for every task. Imagine having to type `word save report.docx` in a terminal window every time you wanted to save in Microsoft Word, or `google revert` to go back a page in Google Chrome. I cannot understand why it is still the default way to interact with Git when it could easily be made to be more user friendly. 

For example, I often use the program ""7-zip"" to compress and decompress files. 7-zip has a command line interface. If I wanted to I could type `7z a` [`file.zip`](https://file.zip) `file.txt` in a terminal window to compress file.txt. However, this is not the default method and does not show up on the first page of a google search. Instead, I can right-click on file.txt in my file explorer, scroll down to 7-Zip in the pop-up menu, and select ""7-Zip > Add to [file.zip](https://file.zip)"". Alternatively, I could use the user-interface that comes pre-installed with 7-zip and compress it from there. Both methods are intuitive and do not require any typing. I don't understand why it's not possible to commit by right-clicking on a Git repository open in file explorer and selecting ""Git > Commit"" in the pop-up menu, or to add a file to the git index by selecting ""Git > Add"". 

I am aware that Git comes pre-installed with Git GUI on Windows, but it looks like it was made in a day using Tkinter. There's no reason for Git not to include a clean, user-friendly graphical interface as part of its default package. I am also aware there are third-party programs like GitKraken that provide a intuitive user-interface. However, the average person is likely deterred before even considering searching for a third-party solution.

To me, Git has always had a strange aura of gate-keeping around it, where it seems intentionally kept needlessly complicated. While it's not difficult to use once you get the hang of it, the initial complexity is kept in to make those who use it feel smarter than the average computer user. 

It's a true shame that Git is not widely accepted as the defacto version control software. Instead, software for non-programmers often have their own built-in VCS. Imagine if Microsoft Office had built in Git support like Visual Studio does? You could create a repository for a class and manage versions for notes, assignments, projects, etc from Word or Powerpoint.

If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read my mini-rant. I'm sure you're all ready to tell me how Git is actually intuitive and I'm just a slow learner in the comments lol.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Git is extremely useful tool for any type of project but its needless complexity makes it scary for people unfamiliar with software development to learn and use.

I can't find a reason why companies choose to artificially limit their stock with products that people can, and will buy.   
Be it the NES/SNES mini, physical collectors' editions for games, art books, dakimakura covers, or literally anything else. There is no reason to not simply offer those items  on-demand after the campaign is over, and if they have a high production cost, the company can just up the price to the point it becomes profitable to sell them, it's not like that's gonna stop the people who really want it.  
I also have a similar opinion on products that are no longer manufactured like old consoles, phones, televisions etc., but that's besides the point of this post.

Now we get to digital limited editions/pre-order exclusive content...  
This is just plain idiocy. It's not like they can simply add said things as DLC, no. They need to sell to you the ""exclusivity"" of having a couple extra lines of code in the game you bought. Or, just having a couple of PNGs that apparently constitute as an ""Art book"".  
There is no way to limit digital content, people are going to either leak it (in the case of things that are standalone), or mod it into the software.

Now, for the conclusion, there is one type of artificial scarcity that I don't have as much of a problem with, and that's backer exclusive physical goods.  
This is because the people who get said products actually helped the project that they backed come into fruition. It is the way that the people who received crowdfunding thank their supporters, that believed in the project that was proposed. It's the way they can say ""It's thanks to you that we got this far.""

185,1708702177.0,Ketchup is only good on brats and burgers.,"When it comes to ketchup, I've found that it just doesn't align with my taste buds unless it's paired with burgers or bratwurst. The sweetness of ketchup tends to overpower other dishes, and fries are no exception. While some may enjoy the classic combination of fries and ketchup, I find that the sweetness of the condiment masks the natural flavors of the fries, diminishing the overall experience for me.Moreover, the intense flavor profile of ketchup tends to dominate dishes like fries or meatloaf, taking away from the enjoyment of the meal. For me, ketchup is best reserved for burgers and bratwurst, where its flavor complements the savory elements of the meat. Outside of these classic pairings, I'll pass on the ketchup and opt for other condiments or enjoy the dish as it is. It's all about personal preference, and for me, ketchup just doesn't work with fries or meatloaf.Change my mind. Give me a recipe that will change my view on ketchup.TLDR; Ketchup only works on burgers and brats. Fries or anything else with ketchup on it sucks. I would like a recipe that will change my mind.

They look down on people who get told what to do and aren't their own boss.  They're out there living the dream in their own mind looking down on employees.

Ironically, they're their own boss but are being told what to do by the customer and market demand.  If they truly did what they wanted to do and it didn't align with demand they'd go broke.

You can get a surprisingly diverse experience as you travel around the country, and so I believe that most people can find something they like about it.

There‚Äôs a varied mix of cities and towns- from charming historic to modern planned towns, industrial eyesores, etc. Anything you could possibly want. 

There‚Äôs a good mix of ancient and modern - interesting history is found on almost every corner spanning thousands of years that we can learn a lot of lessons from. But there‚Äôs also great nightlife, shopping, entertainment, developed infrastructure, etc.

The countryside is beautiful - lush green and tranquil. The number of walking/hiking trails is pretty remarkable and easily accessible, and there‚Äôs also an extensive rugged coastline to explore.

195,1708638991.0,Blended foot is better and more convenient than unblended food.,"Recently, I had the unfortunate experience of losing all my teeth, which required me to blend all my food and drink it through one of those large bubble tea straws. I won't get into how I lost my teeth because it's embarassing and not the point of this discussion, so don't ask.

But anyways, at first it was gross but now that I'm used to it, I think it is superior than the normal method of consumption. It's less messy, you don't need utensils, and it's way easier and portable and it just tastes better. I no longer have to waste time eating breakfast, I can just blend it up and drink it along with my coffee on the way to work. Same for lunch and dinner. I don't need to carry a lunchbox, just a cup. I feel like it's easier to digest and I no longer have to deal with constipiasion, although I do admit that this diet does give me the squirts. That's the only downside. Still, the body does not need to waste energy breaking down the food, since it's already been broken down, therefore I have excess energy for other things like brainpower and muscle building. I'm not a sciencetist or anything, but just think about it, the logic makes sense, right? Anyways, I digress.  In summary, blended food is:

* more convinient
* easier to digest
* tastes better once you get used to the texture
* makes it easier to eat healthy foods you don't like, like brocolli and eggplant
* can mix with sodas and coffee, or gatorade if you're exercising and need energy
* is better overall

198,1708614792.0,There's too much singing on modern mainstream animation.,"In general, there's nothing wrong with a musical animated show/movie. Some of my favorite shows like Bob's Burgers, the Simpsons, and Morel Oral have musical episodes, or devote time specifically for the characters to sing. It can be fun, especially if the voice actors can sing.  
  
That being said, there really should be less of it. There should be more adult animated shows that don't do songs every episode. Animated kid's shows/movies don't have to end in a dance party or sing to progress the plot. It seems like a factory standard to do it that way. (Especially in the West.)  
  
The Into the Spiderverse series is a great example of using music to enhance the experience. Miles singing along with the first song then not again for the rest of the movie was fun! It was a hint of his character, and we still got to experience the music! It's just one example, but there could be more that's done to keep music in without adding singing. 

It kind of seeps into indy animation as well. It's as though you can't have anything mainstream (or for general audiences) without it having the musical type progression.

He is in there to capture rebel leaders, to fight Obi Wan Kenobi, etc. He could very simply have sent a bunch of grunts, but instead he is in the action.
* He is humble and does not tolerate arrogance and bullshit. When everyone is bragging how badass the Death Star is, he brings everyone down to earth and remembers how it is insignificant in the grand scheme of things. And he was right.
* He is resourceful. He doesn't care about hiring bounty hunters, which the empire leadership considers ""scum"". He does what needs to be done to get the job done, and in that case, the job got done.
* He does not tolerate incompetence among people who were put in a leadership position. When he chokes the generals to death, it is not because of pure villainy. It is because his general's bad decisions put unnecessary risk to empire , like alerting the rebels the Empire is coming to Hoth (which required a ground assault, costing men's lives).
* He also takes the time to go personally to the guy who is building the new Death Star to warn him ""our boss is pissed,  you'd better go back to schedule"". He is a bro trying to help his buddy before it is too late.
* On the other hand he promotes individuals who are smart. Like the dude who read a strange signal from the probe droid which might have indicated the rebel base was in Hoth.

201,1708898838.0,"There is nothing wrong with subscription services, just the people who are choosing to buy them.","There is nothing wrong with subscription services. The issue is usually when people are grabbing all of them and never canceling.

A bit of background: I am subscribed to Amazon Prime, Costco, Max, and a local gym.

Subscription serves have been around for a long time, and no one used to complain. They just need to be worth their value to be worth it. For example, Costco has basically been a subscription service for decades. Yet you get your value in your subscription by the money you save by buying in bulk and all the sales. Another example of a good subscription service that has been around for a long time is Amazon Prime. If you are using Amazon frequently then it is worth it to have Prime for the quicker shipping.

The problem most people run into is when they are subscribing to services and not really using them. Which any person who is a normal adult can manage their money going in and out. 

When it comes to the streaming services, I much like this model over cable. I can pick and choose which streaming service I want to watch things from while not being subscribed to anything else. Right now I am working through Max content, and when I am ready for Disney+ I will pick that up for a few months and then cancel it.

203,1708898349.0,Ultimate Spiderman is the best spiderman,"Post is flagged with ""Spoiler"" because I kind of spoil the show ""Ultimate Spiderman"" a little bit on the post, so be aware of that

Most people say Tobey's Spiderman is the best live action Spiderman, and Spectacular is the best cartoon Spiderman, but I come here to digress. Ultimate Spiderman from the disney show is far better than any other version of spiderman i've ever seen. I know this is a really bold take, but this is the correct subreddit for this I think.

Most people really dislike the Ultimate Spiderman show, but I love it. The jokes are all awesome I don't think a single one of them is particularly bad, most are funny. The overall plot gets better throughout the seasons, and I love the Spiderverse episodes and Ultimate Goblin. I think the finale was perfect for the show also.

Overall, when I see Spiderman, this is the kind of spidey I want to see. Funny, making jokes mid battle, breaking the 4th wall. Serious at times when the plot demands it. Tobey doesn't make good jokes and Spectacular isn't on the level of Ultimate.

Tom Holland's Spiderman had a lot of potential but unfortunately they were held back by the other Spiderman movie series(Sam Raimi's and TASM) so they couldn't do something like a Spiderman: The Sinister Six movie which is what I wanted instead of No Way Home

IMO the 2nd best Spiderman is probably Insomniac's from the Marvel's Spiderman games, but that might be because they actually *did* get to do the Sinister Six thing, and it's hard for me to rate only the character forgetting that part. Oh also, Ultimate Spiderman also has several episodes where the Sinister Six come together, and also has in my opinion the best version of Carnage so far. I also love some of the side characters like Nova, Power Man and Agent Venom(Flash Thompson in this show).

I understand why some people may disagree, as they've grown up with more serious versions of the character, but I prefer light hearted spidey 90% of the time, and the other 10%, the same spidey but serious, like in the part where Ben Reilly(Scarlet Spider) reveals Peter's identity to Doc Ock

The more muted colors from cel-animated stuff and a lot of digitally animated stuff from the 2000s(FOP S1, Ren and Stimpy, Danny Phantom, Animaniacs) look a lot nicer than most cartoons nowadays. Mind you, there are stuff I like the color palettes for that came out in recent years. Lupin the 3rd Part IV looks nice color-wise, and I enjoy the recent Dragon Ball stuff from Shintani recently(ex. Super: Broly), and that upcoming Ren and Stimpy reboot seems to be using colors closer to the original run(even if I wish the character animation was more expressive).

254,1708814648.0,Git is needlessly complicated,"Git is an extremely useful tool to use when working on any kind of project but for the last 19 years it's been used almost exclusively by software developers. Git is not inherently limited to software projects and can be used as version control for really anything that involves storing files on a computer. Version control software, such as Git, should be as commonly understood by everyday computer users as internet browsers and antivirus software. Git's learning curve is unnecessary and is the main reason why it is not used by everyone. 

Take the command line for example, open up an internet browser and search ""git tutorial"" or ""how to get started with git"". Every tutorial starts by explaining how to use Git's command line interface. I understand that entering commands into a terminal is not technically ""coding"", but to the average person, it looks effectively the same. It's a significant entry barrier that discourages people unfamiliar with the concept to put in the effort to learn it. No other software commonly used by non-software developers requires the user to use the command line for every task. Imagine having to type `word save report.docx` in a terminal window every time you wanted to save in Microsoft Word, or `google revert` to go back a page in Google Chrome. I cannot understand why it is still the default way to interact with Git when it could easily be made to be more user friendly. 

For example, I often use the program ""7-zip"" to compress and decompress files. 7-zip has a command line interface. If I wanted to I could type `7z a` [`file.zip`](https://file.zip) `file.txt` in a terminal window to compress file.txt. However, this is not the default method and does not show up on the first page of a google search. Instead, I can right-click on file.txt in my file explorer, scroll down to 7-Zip in the pop-up menu, and select ""7-Zip > Add to [file.zip](https://file.zip)"". Alternatively, I could use the user-interface that comes pre-installed with 7-zip and compress it from there. Both methods are intuitive and do not require any typing. I don't understand why it's not possible to commit by right-clicking on a Git repository open in file explorer and selecting ""Git > Commit"" in the pop-up menu, or to add a file to the git index by selecting ""Git > Add"". 

I am aware that Git comes pre-installed with Git GUI on Windows, but it looks like it was made in a day using Tkinter. There's no reason for Git not to include a clean, user-friendly graphical interface as part of its default package. I am also aware there are third-party programs like GitKraken that provide a intuitive user-interface. However, the average person is likely deterred before even considering searching for a third-party solution.

To me, Git has always had a strange aura of gate-keeping around it, where it seems intentionally kept needlessly complicated. While it's not difficult to use once you get the hang of it, the initial complexity is kept in to make those who use it feel smarter than the average computer user. 

It's a true shame that Git is not widely accepted as the defacto version control software. Instead, software for non-programmers often have their own built-in VCS. Imagine if Microsoft Office had built in Git support like Visual Studio does? You could create a repository for a class and manage versions for notes, assignments, projects, etc from Word or Powerpoint.

If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read my mini-rant. I'm sure you're all ready to tell me how Git is actually intuitive and I'm just a slow learner in the comments lol.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Git is extremely useful tool for any type of project but its needless complexity makes it scary for people unfamiliar with software development to learn and use.

I wish the Mario fandom would apperciate the game more. The game deserved a remake for the 3DS. Mario & Luigi Parthers In Time is the perfect sequal to Superstar Saga.,unpopularopinion
272,1708737835.0,"We need less ""discovering who you really are"" stuff.","I've realized what seems to be the dominant current in self care seems to be getting in touch with ""who you are inside"". I couldnt disagree more. I think that what we need more of is people identifying more with the masks they choose for themselves, rather than dipping into their inner world all the time. And I mean specifically how that mask allows them to act in the real world in every facet of their lives.

As an example if someone is a timid and ineffective wimp, what would looking inward do? They'd simply find the ineffectual wimp. If that same wimp decides ""wait I dont want to be this version of me, I want to be this other version"" then in a way they're more like donning a mask and embodying it. This isnt to say theres no examples of how something positive within you can be represses, but often from what I've seen focusing on our inner world rather than our actions in the real world is more like a form of mental masturbation than positive growth.

Edit:And by donning a mask I mean to say adopting a persona. We all have one(or should), and what you do in the world outside of yourself is all that matters to me. A persons inner world doesn't really mean much to me, only what they do.",unpopularopinion
273,1708736636.0,Limited editions/first print editions make no sense economically.,"I get it, having something that you can't get anymore is cool, but that's it...

I can't find a reason why companies choose to artificially limit their stock with products that people can, and will buy.   
Be it the NES/SNES mini, physical collectors' editions for games, art books, dakimakura covers, or literally anything else. There is no reason to not simply offer those items  on-demand after the campaign is over, and if they have a high production cost, the company can just up the price to the point it becomes profitable to sell them, it's not like that's gonna stop the people who really want it.  
I also have a similar opinion on products that are no longer manufactured like old consoles, phones, televisions etc., but that's besides the point of this post.

Now we get to digital limited editions/pre-order exclusive content...  
This is just plain idiocy. It's not like they can simply add said things as DLC, no. They need to sell to you the ""exclusivity"" of having a couple extra lines of code in the game you bought. Or, just having a couple of PNGs that apparently constitute as an ""Art book"".  
There is no way to limit digital content, people are going to either leak it (in the case of things that are standalone), or mod it into the software.

Now, for the conclusion, there is one type of artificial scarcity that I don't have as much of a problem with, and that's backer exclusive physical goods.  
This is because the people who get said products actually helped the project that they backed come into fruition. It is the way that the people who received crowdfunding thank their supporters, that believed in the project that was proposed. It's the way they can say ""It's thanks to you that we got this far.""  
Of course the scarcity is still purely artificial, and anyone with the design documents and contacts in manufacturing can still make them, but it's more about the connection between the backer and the product than the goods themselves.",unpopularopinion

Maybe it makes sense transactionally, but our relationship isn't meant to feel transactional. Maybe it's just my perception of it that makes it feel that way.

I won't get into how I lost my teeth because it's embarassing and not the point of this discussion, so don't ask.

But anyways, at first it was gross but now that I'm used to it, I think it is superior than the normal method of consumption. It's less messy, you don't need utensils, and it's way easier and portable and it just tastes better. I no longer have to waste time eating breakfast, I can just blend it up and drink it along with my coffee on the way to work. Same for lunch and dinner. I don't need to carry a lunchbox, just a cup. I feel like it's easier to digest and I no longer have to deal with constipiasion, although I do admit that this diet does give me the squirts. That's the only downside.

That being said, there really should be less of it. There should be more adult animated shows that don't do songs every episode.

* He does not tolerate incompetence among people who were put in a leadership position. When he chokes the generals to death, it is not because of pure villainy.

A bit of background: I am subscribed to Amazon Prime, Costco, Max, and a local gym.

Subscription serves have been around for a long time, and no one used to complain. They just need to be worth their value to be worth it. For example, Costco has basically been a subscription service for decades. Yet you get your value in your subscription by the money you save by buying in bulk and all the sales. Another example of a good subscription service that has been around for a long time is Amazon Prime. If you are using Amazon frequently then it is worth it to have Prime for the quicker shipping.

The problem most people run into is when they are subscribing to services and not really using them. Which any person who is a normal adult can manage their money going in and out. 

When it comes to the streaming services, I much like this model over cable. I can pick and choose which streaming service I want to watch things from while not being subscribed to anything else.

Most people say Tobey's Spiderman is the best live action Spiderman, and Spectacular is the best cartoon Spiderman, but I come here to digress. Ultimate Spiderman from the disney show is far better than any other version of spiderman i've ever seen. I know this is a really bold take, but this is the correct subreddit for this I think.

Most people really dislike the Ultimate Spiderman show, but I love it. The jokes are all awesome I don't think a single one of them is particularly bad, most are funny. The overall plot gets better throughout the seasons, and I love the Spiderverse episodes and Ultimate Goblin. I think the finale was perfect for the show also.

Overall, when I see Spiderman, this is the kind of spidey I want to see. Funny, making jokes mid battle, breaking the 4th wall. Serious at times when the plot demands it. Tobey doesn't make good jokes and Spectacular isn't on the level of Ultimate.

Tom Holland's Spiderman had a lot of potential but unfortunately they were held back by the other Spiderman movie series(Sam Raimi's and TASM) so they couldn't do something like a Spiderman: The Sinister Six movie which is what I wanted instead of No Way Home

IMO the 2nd best Spiderman is probably Insomniac's from the Marvel's Spiderman games, but that might be because they actually *did* get to do the Sinister Six thing, and it's hard for me to rate only the character forgetting that part. Oh also, Ultimate Spiderman also has several episodes where the Sinister Six come together, and also has in my opinion the best version of Carnage so far. I also love some of the side characters like Nova, Power Man and Agent Venom(Flash Thompson in this show).

I understand why some people may disagree, as they've grown up with more serious versions of the character, but I prefer light hearted spidey 90% of the time, and the other 10%, the same spidey but serious, like in the part where Ben Reilly(Scarlet Spider) reveals Peter's identity to Doc Ock

354,1708814648.0,Git is needlessly complicated,"Git is an extremely useful tool to use when working on any kind of project but for the last 19 years it's been used almost exclusively by software developers. Git is not inherently limited to software projects and can be used as version control for really anything that involves storing files on a computer. Version control software, such as Git, should be as commonly understood by everyday computer users as internet browsers and antivirus software. Git's learning curve is unnecessary and is the main reason why it is not used by everyone. 

Take the command line for example, open up an internet browser and search ""git tutorial"" or ""how to get started with git"". Every tutorial starts by explaining how to use Git's command line interface. I understand that entering commands into a terminal is not technically ""coding"", but to the average person, it looks effectively the same. It's a significant entry barrier that discourages people unfamiliar with the concept to put in the effort to learn it. No other software commonly used by non-software developers requires the user to use the command line for every task. Imagine having to type `word save report.docx` in a terminal window every time you wanted to save in Microsoft Word, or `google revert` to go back a page in Google Chrome. I cannot understand why it is still the default way to interact with Git when it could easily be made to be more user friendly. 

For example, I often use the program ""7-zip"" to compress and decompress files. 7-zip has a command line interface. If I wanted to I could type `7z a` [`file.zip`](https://file.zip) `file.txt` in a terminal window to compress file.txt. However, this is not the default method and does not show up on the first page of a google search. Instead, I can right-click on file.txt in my file explorer, scroll down to 7-Zip in the pop-up menu, and select ""7-Zip > Add to [file.zip](https://file.zip)"". Alternatively, I could use the user-interface that comes pre-installed with 7-zip and compress it from there. Both methods are intuitive and do not require any typing. I don't understand why it's not possible to commit by right-clicking on a Git repository open in file explorer and selecting ""Git > Commit"" in the pop-up menu, or to add a file to the git index by selecting ""Git > Add"". 

I am aware that Git comes pre-installed with Git GUI on Windows, but it looks like it was made in a day using Tkinter. There's no reason for Git not to include a clean, user-friendly graphical interface as part of its default package. I am also aware there are third-party programs like GitKraken that provide a intuitive user-interface. However, the average person is likely deterred before even considering searching for a third-party solution.

To me, Git has always had a strange aura of gate-keeping around it, where it seems intentionally kept needlessly complicated. While it's not difficult to use once you get the hang of it, the initial complexity is kept in to make those who use it feel smarter than the average computer user. 

It's a true shame that Git is not widely accepted as the defacto version control software. Instead, software for non-programmers often have their own built-in VCS. Imagine if Microsoft Office had built in Git support like Visual Studio does? You could create a repository for a class and manage versions for notes, assignments, projects, etc from Word or Powerpoint.

If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read my mini-rant. I'm sure you're all ready to tell me how Git is actually intuitive and I'm just a slow learner in the comments lol.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Git is extremely useful tool for any type of project but its needless complexity makes it scary for people unfamiliar with software development to learn and use.

For example, Tenet took a perfectly original and interesting high concept sci-fi premise and turned it into an unpleasant experience with  muddled storytelling and cheesy dialogue. Same with Inception, Interstellar and honestly almost all of his later work. 

It seemed to get progressively worse the more mainstream success he has seen, and contrasts starkly with his earlier work which I consider to be far superior, especially Memento. One exception was The Prestige, which I found to be an above average, easily digestible thriller with solid performances and period details.

As an example if someone is a timid and ineffective wimp, what would looking inward do? They'd simply find the ineffectual wimp.

373,1708736636.0,Limited editions/first print editions make no sense economically.,"I get it, having something that you can't get anymore is cool, but that's it...

I can't find a reason why companies choose to artificially limit their stock with products that people can, and will buy.   
Be it the NES/SNES mini, physical collectors' editions for games, art books, dakimakura covers, or literally anything else. There is no reason to not simply offer those items  on-demand after the campaign is over, and if they have a high production cost, the company can just up the price to the point it becomes profitable to sell them, it's not like that's gonna stop the people who really want it.  
I also have a similar opinion on products that are no longer manufactured like old consoles, phones, televisions etc., but that's besides the point of this post.

Now we get to digital limited editions/pre-order exclusive content...  
This is just plain idiocy. It's not like they can simply add said things as DLC, no. They need to sell to you the ""exclusivity"" of having a couple extra lines of code in the game you bought. Or, just having a couple of PNGs that apparently constitute as an ""Art book"".  
There is no way to limit digital content, people are going to either leak it (in the case of things that are standalone), or mod it into the software.

Now, for the conclusion, there is one type of artificial scarcity that I don't have as much of a problem with, and that's backer exclusive physical goods.  
This is because the people who get said products actually helped the project that they backed come into fruition. It is the way that the people who received crowdfunding thank their supporters, that believed in the project that was proposed. It's the way they can say ""It's thanks to you that we got this far.""  
Of course the scarcity is still purely artificial, and anyone with the design documents and contacts in manufacturing can still make them, but it's more about the connection between the backer and the product than the goods themselves.",unpopularopinion

Maybe it makes sense transactionally, but our relationship isn't meant to feel transactional. Maybe it's just my perception of it that makes it feel that way.

I won't get into how I lost my teeth because it's embarassing and not the point of this discussion, so don't ask.

But anyways, at first it was gross but now that I'm used to it, I think it is superior than the normal method of consumption. It's less messy, you don't need utensils, and it's way easier and portable and it just tastes better. I no longer have to waste time eating breakfast, I can just blend it up and drink it along with my coffee on the way to work. Same for lunch and dinner. I don't need to carry a lunchbox, just a cup. I feel like it's easier to digest and I no longer have to deal with constipiasion, although I do admit that this diet does give me the squirts. That's the only downside. Still, the body does not need to waste energy breaking down the food, since it's already been broken down, therefore I have excess energy for other things like brainpower and muscle building. I'm not a sciencetist or anything, but just think about it, the logic makes sense, right? Anyways, I digress.  In summary, blended food is:

* more convinient
* easier to digest
* tastes better once you get used to the texture
* makes it easier to eat healthy foods you don't like, like brocolli and eggplant

It can be fun, especially if the voice actors can sing.  
  
That being said, there really should be less of it. There should be more adult animated shows that don't do songs every episode. Animated kid's shows/movies don't have to end in a dance party or sing to progress the plot. It seems like a factory standard to do it that way. (Especially in the West.)  
  
The Into the Spiderverse series is a great example of using music to enhance the experience. Miles singing along with the first song then not again for the rest of the movie was fun! It was a hint of his character, and we still got to experience the music! It's just one example, but there could be more that's done to keep music in without adding singing. 

It kind of seeps into indy animation as well. It's as though you can't have anything mainstream (or for general audiences) without it having the musical type progression.   
  
(Also like to point out, I'm not bringing mainstream anime in the equation. It is animation but it's exactly what I'm referring too. I'm talking animated shows you'd find on Hulu, or Netflix, or even T.V.",unpopularopinion
399,1708582899.0,Darth Vader is an exemplary leader,"Everyone thinks of Darth Vader as the ruthless bad guy who kills everyone who opposes him. But he actually shows very strong leadership traits:

* While he is the most powerful individual in the Galactic Empire after the emperor, he does not lead from an ivory tower. He gets his hand dirty. A rebel fleet is attacking the Death Star? Not only he is in a fighter with his fellow pilots, he actually shoots down most of the enemy ships himself. He is in there to capture rebel leaders, to fight Obi Wan Kenobi, etc. He could very simply have sent a bunch of grunts, but instead he is in the action.
* He is humble and does not tolerate arrogance and bullshit. When everyone is bragging how badass the Death Star is, he brings everyone down to earth and remembers how it is insignificant in the grand scheme of things. And he was right.
* He is resourceful. He doesn't care about hiring bounty hunters, which the empire leadership considers ""scum"". He does what needs to be done to get the job done, and in that case, the job got done.
* He does not tolerate incompetence among people who were put in a leadership position. When he chokes the generals to death, it is not because of pure villainy. It is because his general's bad decisions put unnecessary risk to empire , like alerting the rebels the Empire is coming to Hoth (which required a ground assault, costing men's lives).
* He also takes the time to go personally to the guy who is building the new Death Star to warn him ""our boss is pissed,  you'd better go back to schedule"". He is a bro trying to help his buddy before it is too late.
* On the other hand he promotes individuals who are smart. Like the dude who read a strange signal from the probe droid which might have indicated the rebel base was in Hoth.

If you are smart and humble, you will do fine by having him to your side while crushing the rebel scum.",unpopularopinion

401,1708898838.0,"There is nothing wrong with subscription services, just the people who are choosing to buy them.","There is nothing wrong with subscription services. The issue is usually when people are grabbing all of them and never canceling.

A bit of background: I am subscribed to Amazon Prime, Costco, Max, and a local gym.

Subscription serves have been around for a long time, and no one used to complain. They just need to be worth their value to be worth it. For example, Costco has basically been a subscription service for decades. Yet you get your value in your subscription by the money you save by buying in bulk and all the sales. Another example of a good subscription service that has been around for a long time is Amazon Prime. If you are using Amazon frequently then it is worth it to have Prime for the quicker shipping.

The problem most people run into is when they are subscribing to services and not really using them. Which any person who is a normal adult can manage their money going in and out. 

When it comes to the streaming services, I much like this model over cable. I can pick and choose which streaming service I want to watch things from while not being subscribed to anything else. Right now I am working through Max content, and when I am ready for Disney+ I will pick that up for a few months and then cancel it. I dropped Netflix last year and will likely not pick it up again for another few years at this rate.

403,1708898349.0,Ultimate Spiderman is the best spiderman,"Post is flagged with ""Spoiler"" because I kind of spoil the show ""Ultimate Spiderman"" a little bit on the post, so be aware of that

Most people say Tobey's Spiderman is the best live action Spiderman, and Spectacular is the best cartoon Spiderman, but I come here to digress. Ultimate Spiderman from the disney show is far better than any other version of spiderman i've ever seen. I know this is a really bold take, but this is the correct subreddit for this I think.

Most people really dislike the Ultimate Spiderman show, but I love it. The jokes are all awesome I don't think a single one of them is particularly bad, most are funny. The overall plot gets better throughout the seasons, and I love the Spiderverse episodes and Ultimate Goblin. I think the finale was perfect for the show also.

Overall, when I see Spiderman, this is the kind of spidey I want to see. Funny, making jokes mid battle, breaking the 4th wall. Serious at times when the plot demands it. Tobey doesn't make good jokes and Spectacular isn't on the level of Ultimate.

Tom Holland's Spiderman had a lot of potential but unfortunately they were held back by the other Spiderman movie series(Sam Raimi's and TASM) so they couldn't do something like a Spiderman: The Sinister Six movie which is what I wanted instead of No Way Home

IMO the 2nd best Spiderman is probably Insomniac's from the Marvel's Spiderman games, but that might be because they actually *did* get to do the Sinister Six thing, and it's hard for me to rate only the character forgetting that part. Oh also, Ultimate Spiderman also has several episodes where the Sinister Six come together, and also has in my opinion the best version of Carnage so far. I also love some of the side characters like Nova, Power Man and Agent Venom(Flash Thompson in this show).

I understand why some people may disagree, as they've grown up with more serious versions of the character, but I prefer light hearted spidey 90% of the time, and the other 10%, the same spidey but serious, like in the part where Ben Reilly(Scarlet Spider) reveals Peter's identity to Doc Ock

Michael Jackson didn't pay Jordan Chandler anything, his insurance company did. It was their choice, not Michael's. The settlement didn't prevent Jordan from testifying in criminal court, he just simply refused to. Jordan's own mother seems to think MJ was innocent and according to rumors Jordan himself has said his dad made him lie about those things and it was all for the money. The Leaving Neverland -documentary is filled with nonsense, like for example they claim he somehow committed crimes in Paris disneyland and Neverland train station years before they were even built.

451,1708818603.0,Symbolism in media is not that important,"  
I think some people simply love movies or series loaded with symbolism and forget that symbolism isn't **that** important.  
  
  
For example, while watching Breaking Bad and noticing the Color Theory was fun, at the end of the day, it's just a detail. The show was good because of the characters, the plot, and the execution. Not because ""Wow! Gus wears **red** when he's about to do something **violent**, that's so **deep**!""  
  
  
And then there are some movies and series that seem to ignore that besides this symbolism, you need a structure that doesn't depend on it to remain solid. I can name a few series like that here: Midsommar, Hereditary, Evangelion, Zima Blue (episode from ""Love, Death & Robots""), some episodes of Black Mirror.

454,1708814648.0,Git is needlessly complicated,"Git is an extremely useful tool to use when working on any kind of project but for the last 19 years it's been used almost exclusively by software developers. Git is not inherently limited to software projects and can be used as version control for really anything that involves storing files on a computer. Version control software, such as Git, should be as commonly understood by everyday computer users as internet browsers and antivirus software. Git's learning curve is unnecessary and is the main reason why it is not used by everyone. 

Take the command line for example, open up an internet browser and search ""git tutorial"" or ""how to get started with git"". Every tutorial starts by explaining how to use Git's command line interface. I understand that entering commands into a terminal is not technically ""coding"", but to the average person, it looks effectively the same. It's a significant entry barrier that discourages people unfamiliar with the concept to put in the effort to learn it. No other software commonly used by non-software developers requires the user to use the command line for every task. Imagine having to type `word save report.docx` in a terminal window every time you wanted to save in Microsoft Word, or `google revert` to go back a page in Google Chrome. I cannot understand why it is still the default way to interact with Git when it could easily be made to be more user friendly. 

For example, I often use the program ""7-zip"" to compress and decompress files. 7-zip has a command line interface. If I wanted to I could type `7z a` [`file.zip`](https://file.zip) `file.txt` in a terminal window to compress file.txt. However, this is not the default method and does not show up on the first page of a google search. Instead, I can right-click on file.txt in my file explorer, scroll down to 7-Zip in the pop-up menu, and select ""7-Zip > Add to [file.zip](https://file.zip)"". Alternatively, I could use the user-interface that comes pre-installed with 7-zip and compress it from there. Both methods are intuitive and do not require any typing. I don't understand why it's not possible to commit by right-clicking on a Git repository open in file explorer and selecting ""Git > Commit"" in the pop-up menu, or to add a file to the git index by selecting ""Git > Add"". 

I am aware that Git comes pre-installed with Git GUI on Windows, but it looks like it was made in a day using Tkinter. There's no reason for Git not to include a clean, user-friendly graphical interface as part of its default package. I am also aware there are third-party programs like GitKraken that provide a intuitive user-interface. However, the average person is likely deterred before even considering searching for a third-party solution.

To me, Git has always had a strange aura of gate-keeping around it, where it seems intentionally kept needlessly complicated. While it's not difficult to use once you get the hang of it, the initial complexity is kept in to make those who use it feel smarter than the average computer user. 

It's a true shame that Git is not widely accepted as the defacto version control software. Instead, software for non-programmers often have their own built-in VCS. Imagine if Microsoft Office had built in Git support like Visual Studio does? You could create a repository for a class and manage versions for notes, assignments, projects, etc from Word or Powerpoint.

If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read my mini-rant. I'm sure you're all ready to tell me how Git is actually intuitive and I'm just a slow learner in the comments lol.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Git is extremely useful tool for any type of project but its needless complexity makes it scary for people unfamiliar with software development to learn and use.

I can't find a reason why companies choose to artificially limit their stock with products that people can, and will buy.   
Be it the NES/SNES mini, physical collectors' editions for games, art books, dakimakura covers, or literally anything else. There is no reason to not simply offer those items  on-demand after the campaign is over, and if they have a high production cost, the company can just up the price to the point it becomes profitable to sell them, it's not like that's gonna stop the people who really want it.  
I also have a similar opinion on products that are no longer manufactured like old consoles, phones, televisions etc., but that's besides the point of this post.

Now we get to digital limited editions/pre-order exclusive content...  
This is just plain idiocy. It's not like they can simply add said things as DLC, no. They need to sell to you the ""exclusivity"" of having a couple extra lines of code in the game you bought. Or, just having a couple of PNGs that apparently constitute as an ""Art book"".  
There is no way to limit digital content, people are going to either leak it (in the case of things that are standalone), or mod it into the software.

Now, for the conclusion, there is one type of artificial scarcity that I don't have as much of a problem with, and that's backer exclusive physical goods.  
This is because the people who get said products actually helped the project that they backed come into fruition. It is the way that the people who received crowdfunding thank their supporters, that believed in the project that was proposed. It's the way they can say ""It's thanks to you that we got this far.""

488,1708674282.0,Small business owners are often insufferable people,"They look down on people who don't own their own business.  Think of all of the times you heard the phrase ""I want to be my own boss"" or "" I don't want anyone telling me what to do"" or they want out of the 9 to 5 rat race.  They look down on people who get told what to do and aren't their own boss.  They're out there living the dream in their own mind looking down on employees.

Ironically, they're their own boss but are being told what to do by the customer and market demand.  If they truly did what they wanted to do and it didn't align with demand they'd go broke.

We're supposed to priase them for ""taking a risk"" to start their business, that's like praising a gambler for betting all of his money on black at the roulette table.  Or praising a well-off trust fund kid for starting something when there wasn't much risk to begin with.

Not to mention small business owners could easily be criminals.  Why don't they want to work for a company?  A criminal record?

Another example: skateshops.  People say buy from your local skateshop, but sometimes the owners of those shops are elitist pricks who look down on beginners.

There‚Äôs so much more to the country than just London. I‚Äôve spent most of my life travelling around the UK and I think England ticks the boxes for most of the things people praise other countries for. 

You can get a surprisingly diverse experience as you travel around the country, and so I believe that most people can find something they like about it. 

Countless towns and regions have their own cultural identities, ways of life, dialects/accents, food traditions, architecture, and genetic makeup. There‚Äôs a varied mix of cities and towns- from charming historic to modern planned towns, industrial eyesores, etc. Anything you could possibly want. 

There‚Äôs a good mix of ancient and modern - interesting history is found on almost every corner spanning thousands of years that we can learn a lot of lessons from. But there‚Äôs also great nightlife, shopping, entertainment, developed infrastructure, etc.

The countryside is beautiful - lush green and tranquil. The number of walking/hiking trails is pretty remarkable and easily accessible, and there‚Äôs also an extensive rugged coastline to explore. 

The country just has a lot to offer and I shake my head at how the national image has been reduced to Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, football, and binge drinking whilst other countries receive praise for their range of culture, heritage, landscapes, etc.

495,1708638991.0,Blended foot is better and more convenient than unblended food.,"Recently, I had the unfortunate experience of losing all my teeth, which required me to blend all my food and drink it through one of those large bubble tea straws. I won't get into how I lost my teeth because it's embarassing and not the point of this discussion, so don't ask.

But anyways, at first it was gross but now that I'm used to it, I think it is superior than the normal method of consumption. It's less messy, you don't need utensils, and it's way easier and portable and it just tastes better. I no longer have to waste time eating breakfast, I can just blend it up and drink it along with my coffee on the way to work. Same for lunch and dinner. I don't need to carry a lunchbox, just a cup. I feel like it's easier to digest and I no longer have to deal with constipiasion, although I do admit that this diet does give me the squirts. That's the only downside. Still, the body does not need to waste energy breaking down the food, since it's already been broken down, therefore I have excess energy for other things like brainpower and muscle building. I'm not a sciencetist or anything, but just think about it, the logic makes sense, right? Anyways, I digress.  In summary, blended food is:

* more convinient
* easier to digest
* tastes better once you get used to the texture
* makes it easier to eat healthy foods you don't like, like brocolli and eggplant
* can mix with sodas and coffee, or gatorade if you're exercising and need energy
* is better overall

498,1708614792.0,There's too much singing on modern mainstream animation.,"In general, there's nothing wrong with a musical animated show/movie. Some of my favorite shows like Bob's Burgers, the Simpsons, and Morel Oral have musical episodes, or devote time specifically for the characters to sing. It can be fun, especially if the voice actors can sing.  
  
That being said, there really should be less of it. There should be more adult animated shows that don't do songs every episode. Animated kid's shows/movies don't have to end in a dance party or sing to progress the plot. It seems like a factory standard to do it that way. (Especially in the West.)  
  
The Into the Spiderverse series is a great example of using music to enhance the experience. Miles singing along with the first song then not again for the rest of the movie was fun! It was a hint of his character, and we still got to experience the music! It's just one example, but there could be more that's done to keep music in without adding singing. 

It kind of seeps into indy animation as well. It's as though you can't have anything mainstream (or for general audiences) without it having the musical type progression.

* While he is the most powerful individual in the Galactic Empire after the emperor, he does not lead from an ivory tower. He gets his hand dirty. A rebel fleet is attacking the Death Star? Not only he is in a fighter with his fellow pilots, he actually shoots down most of the enemy ships himself. He is in there to capture rebel leaders, to fight Obi Wan Kenobi, etc. He could very simply have sent a bunch of grunts, but instead he is in the action.
* He is humble and does not tolerate arrogance and bullshit. When everyone is bragging how badass the Death Star is, he brings everyone down to earth and remembers how it is insignificant in the grand scheme of things. And he was right.
* He is resourceful. He doesn't care about hiring bounty hunters, which the empire leadership considers ""scum"". He does what needs to be done to get the job done, and in that case, the job got done.
* He does not tolerate incompetence among people who were put in a leadership position. When he chokes the generals to death, it is not because of pure villainy. It is because his general's bad decisions put unnecessary risk to empire , like alerting the rebels the Empire is coming to Hoth (which required a ground assault, costing men's lives).
* He also takes the time to go personally to the guy who is building the new Death Star to warn him ""our boss is pissed,  you'd better go back to schedule"". He is a bro trying to help his buddy before it is too late.
* On the other hand he promotes individuals who are smart. Like the dude who read a strange signal from the probe droid which might have indicated the rebel base was in Hoth.

501,1708898838.0,"There is nothing wrong with subscription services, just the people who are choosing to buy them.","There is nothing wrong with subscription services. The issue is usually when people are grabbing all of them and never canceling.

A bit of background: I am subscribed to Amazon Prime, Costco, Max, and a local gym.

Subscription serves have been around for a long time, and no one used to complain. They just need to be worth their value to be worth it. For example, Costco has basically been a subscription service for decades. Yet you get your value in your subscription by the money you save by buying in bulk and all the sales. Another example of a good subscription service that has been around for a long time is Amazon Prime. If you are using Amazon frequently then it is worth it to have Prime for the quicker shipping.

The problem most people run into is when they are subscribing to services and not really using them. Which any person who is a normal adult can manage their money going in and out. 

When it comes to the streaming services, I much like this model over cable. I can pick and choose which streaming service I want to watch things from while not being subscribed to anything else. Right now I am working through Max content, and when I am ready for Disney+ I will pick that up for a few months and then cancel it. I dropped Netflix last year and will likely not pick it up again for another few years at this rate.

503,1708898349.0,Ultimate Spiderman is the best spiderman,"Post is flagged with ""Spoiler"" because I kind of spoil the show ""Ultimate Spiderman"" a little bit on the post, so be aware of that

Most people say Tobey's Spiderman is the best live action Spiderman, and Spectacular is the best cartoon Spiderman, but I come here to digress. Ultimate Spiderman from the disney show is far better than any other version of spiderman i've ever seen. I know this is a really bold take, but this is the correct subreddit for this I think.

Most people really dislike the Ultimate Spiderman show, but I love it. The jokes are all awesome I don't think a single one of them is particularly bad, most are funny. The overall plot gets better throughout the seasons, and I love the Spiderverse episodes and Ultimate Goblin. I think the finale was perfect for the show also.

Overall, when I see Spiderman, this is the kind of spidey I want to see. Funny, making jokes mid battle, breaking the 4th wall. Serious at times when the plot demands it. Tobey doesn't make good jokes and Spectacular isn't on the level of Ultimate.

Tom Holland's Spiderman had a lot of potential but unfortunately they were held back by the other Spiderman movie series(Sam Raimi's and TASM) so they couldn't do something like a Spiderman: The Sinister Six movie which is what I wanted instead of No Way Home

IMO the 2nd best Spiderman is probably Insomniac's from the Marvel's Spiderman games, but that might be because they actually *did* get to do the Sinister Six thing, and it's hard for me to rate only the character forgetting that part. Oh also, Ultimate Spiderman also has several episodes where the Sinister Six come together, and also has in my opinion the best version of Carnage so far. I also love some of the side characters like Nova, Power Man and Agent Venom(Flash Thompson in this show).

I understand why some people may disagree, as they've grown up with more serious versions of the character, but I prefer light hearted spidey 90% of the time, and the other 10%, the same spidey but serious, like in the part where Ben Reilly(Scarlet Spider) reveals Peter's identity to Doc Ock

Michael Jackson didn't pay Jordan Chandler anything, his insurance company did. It was their choice, not Michael's.

And then there are some movies and series that seem to ignore that besides this symbolism, you need a structure that doesn't depend on it to remain solid.

554,1708814648.0,Git is needlessly complicated,"Git is an extremely useful tool to use when working on any kind of project but for the last 19 years it's been used almost exclusively by software developers. Git is not inherently limited to software projects and can be used as version control for really anything that involves storing files on a computer. Version control software, such as Git, should be as commonly understood by everyday computer users as internet browsers and antivirus software. Git's learning curve is unnecessary and is the main reason why it is not used by everyone. 

Take the command line for example, open up an internet browser and search ""git tutorial"" or ""how to get started with git"". Every tutorial starts by explaining how to use Git's command line interface. I understand that entering commands into a terminal is not technically ""coding"", but to the average person, it looks effectively the same. It's a significant entry barrier that discourages people unfamiliar with the concept to put in the effort to learn it. No other software commonly used by non-software developers requires the user to use the command line for every task. Imagine having to type `word save report.docx` in a terminal window every time you wanted to save in Microsoft Word, or `google revert` to go back a page in Google Chrome. I cannot understand why it is still the default way to interact with Git when it could easily be made to be more user friendly. 

For example, I often use the program ""7-zip"" to compress and decompress files. 7-zip has a command line interface. If I wanted to I could type `7z a` [`file.zip`](https://file.zip) `file.txt` in a terminal window to compress file.txt. However, this is not the default method and does not show up on the first page of a google search. Instead, I can right-click on file.txt in my file explorer, scroll down to 7-Zip in the pop-up menu, and select ""7-Zip > Add to [file.zip](https://file.zip)"". Alternatively, I could use the user-interface that comes pre-installed with 7-zip and compress it from there. Both methods are intuitive and do not require any typing. I don't understand why it's not possible to commit by right-clicking on a Git repository open in file explorer and selecting ""Git > Commit"" in the pop-up menu, or to add a file to the git index by selecting ""Git > Add"". 

I am aware that Git comes pre-installed with Git GUI on Windows, but it looks like it was made in a day using Tkinter. There's no reason for Git not to include a clean, user-friendly graphical interface as part of its default package. I am also aware there are third-party programs like GitKraken that provide a intuitive user-interface. However, the average person is likely deterred before even considering searching for a third-party solution.

To me, Git has always had a strange aura of gate-keeping around it, where it seems intentionally kept needlessly complicated. While it's not difficult to use once you get the hang of it, the initial complexity is kept in to make those who use it feel smarter than the average computer user. 

It's a true shame that Git is not widely accepted as the defacto version control software. Instead, software for non-programmers often have their own built-in VCS. Imagine if Microsoft Office had built in Git support like Visual Studio does? You could create a repository for a class and manage versions for notes, assignments, projects, etc from Word or Powerpoint.

If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read my mini-rant. I'm sure you're all ready to tell me how Git is actually intuitive and I'm just a slow learner in the comments lol.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Git is extremely useful tool for any type of project but its needless complexity makes it scary for people unfamiliar with software development to learn and use.

573,1708736636.0,Limited editions/first print editions make no sense economically.,"I get it, having something that you can't get anymore is cool, but that's it...

I can't find a reason why companies choose to artificially limit their stock with products that people can, and will buy.   
Be it the NES/SNES mini, physical collectors' editions for games, art books, dakimakura covers, or literally anything else. There is no reason to not simply offer those items  on-demand after the campaign is over, and if they have a high production cost, the company can just up the price to the point it becomes profitable to sell them, it's not like that's gonna stop the people who really want it.  
I also have a similar opinion on products that are no longer manufactured like old consoles, phones, televisions etc., but that's besides the point of this post.

Now we get to digital limited editions/pre-order exclusive content...  
This is just plain idiocy. It's not like they can simply add said things as DLC, no. They need to sell to you the ""exclusivity"" of having a couple extra lines of code in the game you bought. Or, just having a couple of PNGs that apparently constitute as an ""Art book"".  
There is no way to limit digital content, people are going to either leak it (in the case of things that are standalone), or mod it into the software.

Now, for the conclusion, there is one type of artificial scarcity that I don't have as much of a problem with, and that's backer exclusive physical goods.  
This is because the people who get said products actually helped the project that they backed come into fruition. It is the way that the people who received crowdfunding thank their supporters, that believed in the project that was proposed. It's the way they can say ""It's thanks to you that we got this far.""

To me, it's a better flow in the evening than, for example, if one of us has to work late, the other cooks dinner and then there's this expectation of ""I did you the favor of cooking, now you can clean up the kitchen"". Maybe it makes sense transactionally, but our relationship isn't meant to feel transactional. Maybe it's just my perception of it that makes it feel that way. For me, I just think it's more about ""finishing something you started"".

While some may enjoy the classic combination of fries and ketchup, I find that the sweetness of the condiment masks the natural flavors of the fries, diminishing the overall experience for me.Moreover, the intense flavor profile of ketchup tends to dominate dishes like fries or meatloaf, taking away from the enjoyment of the meal. For me, ketchup is best reserved for burgers and bratwurst, where its flavor complements the savory elements of the meat.

I won't get into how I lost my teeth because it's embarassing and not the point of this discussion, so don't ask.

But anyways, at first it was gross but now that I'm used to it, I think it is superior than the normal method of consumption. It's less messy, you don't need utensils, and it's way easier and portable and it just tastes better. I no longer have to waste time eating breakfast, I can just blend it up and drink it along with my coffee on the way to work. Same for lunch and dinner. I don't need to carry a lunchbox, just a cup. I feel like it's easier to digest and I no longer have to deal with constipiasion, although I do admit that this diet does give me the squirts. That's the only downside. Still, the body does not need to waste energy breaking down the food, since it's already been broken down, therefore I have excess energy for other things like brainpower and muscle building. I'm not a sciencetist or anything, but just think about it, the logic makes sense, right? Anyways, I digress.  In summary, blended food is:

* more convinient
* easier to digest
* tastes better once you get used to the texture
* makes it easier to eat healthy foods you don't like, like brocolli and eggplant
* can mix with sodas and coffee, or gatorade if you're exercising and need energy
* is better overall

Some of my favorite shows like Bob's Burgers, the Simpsons, and Morel Oral have musical episodes, or devote time specifically for the characters to sing. It can be fun, especially if the voice actors can sing.  
  
That being said, there really should be less of it. There should be more adult animated shows that don't do songs every episode. Animated kid's shows/movies don't have to end in a dance party or sing to progress the plot. It seems like a factory standard to do it that way. (Especially in the West.)  
  
The Into the Spiderverse series is a great example of using music to enhance the experience. Miles singing along with the first song then not again for the rest of the movie was fun! It was a hint of his character, and we still got to experience the music! It's just one example, but there could be more that's done to keep music in without adding singing.

He is in there to capture rebel leaders, to fight Obi Wan Kenobi, etc. He could very simply have sent a bunch of grunts, but instead he is in the action.
* He is humble and does not tolerate arrogance and bullshit. When everyone is bragging how badass the Death Star is, he brings everyone down to earth and remembers how it is insignificant in the grand scheme of things. And he was right.
* He is resourceful. He doesn't care about hiring bounty hunters, which the empire leadership considers ""scum"". He does what needs to be done to get the job done, and in that case, the job got done.
* He does not tolerate incompetence among people who were put in a leadership position. When he chokes the generals to death, it is not because of pure villainy. It is because his general's bad decisions put unnecessary risk to empire , like alerting the rebels the Empire is coming to Hoth (which required a ground assault, costing men's lives).
* He also takes the time to go personally to the guy who is building the new Death Star to warn him ""our boss is pissed,  you'd better go back to schedule"". He is a bro trying to help his buddy before it is too late.

A bit of background: I am subscribed to Amazon Prime, Costco, Max, and a local gym.

Subscription serves have been around for a long time, and no one used to complain. They just need to be worth their value to be worth it. For example, Costco has basically been a subscription service for decades. Yet you get your value in your subscription by the money you save by buying in bulk and all the sales. Another example of a good subscription service that has been around for a long time is Amazon Prime. If you are using Amazon frequently then it is worth it to have Prime for the quicker shipping.

The problem most people run into is when they are subscribing to services and not really using them. Which any person who is a normal adult can manage their money going in and out. 

When it comes to the streaming services, I much like this model over cable. I can pick and choose which streaming service I want to watch things from while not being subscribed to anything else.

Most people say Tobey's Spiderman is the best live action Spiderman, and Spectacular is the best cartoon Spiderman, but I come here to digress. Ultimate Spiderman from the disney show is far better than any other version of spiderman i've ever seen. I know this is a really bold take, but this is the correct subreddit for this I think.

Most people really dislike the Ultimate Spiderman show, but I love it. The jokes are all awesome I don't think a single one of them is particularly bad, most are funny. The overall plot gets better throughout the seasons, and I love the Spiderverse episodes and Ultimate Goblin. I think the finale was perfect for the show also.

Overall, when I see Spiderman, this is the kind of spidey I want to see. Funny, making jokes mid battle, breaking the 4th wall. Serious at times when the plot demands it. Tobey doesn't make good jokes and Spectacular isn't on the level of Ultimate.

Tom Holland's Spiderman had a lot of potential but unfortunately they were held back by the other Spiderman movie series(Sam Raimi's and TASM) so they couldn't do something like a Spiderman: The Sinister Six movie which is what I wanted instead of No Way Home

IMO the 2nd best Spiderman is probably Insomniac's from the Marvel's Spiderman games, but that might be because they actually *did* get to do the Sinister Six thing, and it's hard for me to rate only the character forgetting that part. Oh also, Ultimate Spiderman also has several episodes where the Sinister Six come together, and also has in my opinion the best version of Carnage so far. I also love some of the side characters like Nova, Power Man and Agent Venom(Flash Thompson in this show).

I understand why some people may disagree, as they've grown up with more serious versions of the character, but I prefer light hearted spidey 90% of the time, and the other 10%, the same spidey but serious, like in the part where Ben Reilly(Scarlet Spider) reveals Peter's identity to Doc Ock

The more muted colors from cel-animated stuff and a lot of digitally animated stuff from the 2000s(FOP S1, Ren and Stimpy, Danny Phantom, Animaniacs) look a lot nicer than most cartoons nowadays. Mind you, there are stuff I like the color palettes for that came out in recent years. Lupin the 3rd Part IV looks nice color-wise, and I enjoy the recent Dragon Ball stuff from Shintani recently(ex.

654,1708814648.0,Git is needlessly complicated,"Git is an extremely useful tool to use when working on any kind of project but for the last 19 years it's been used almost exclusively by software developers. Git is not inherently limited to software projects and can be used as version control for really anything that involves storing files on a computer. Version control software, such as Git, should be as commonly understood by everyday computer users as internet browsers and antivirus software. Git's learning curve is unnecessary and is the main reason why it is not used by everyone. 

Take the command line for example, open up an internet browser and search ""git tutorial"" or ""how to get started with git"". Every tutorial starts by explaining how to use Git's command line interface. I understand that entering commands into a terminal is not technically ""coding"", but to the average person, it looks effectively the same. It's a significant entry barrier that discourages people unfamiliar with the concept to put in the effort to learn it. No other software commonly used by non-software developers requires the user to use the command line for every task. Imagine having to type `word save report.docx` in a terminal window every time you wanted to save in Microsoft Word, or `google revert` to go back a page in Google Chrome. I cannot understand why it is still the default way to interact with Git when it could easily be made to be more user friendly. 

For example, I often use the program ""7-zip"" to compress and decompress files. 7-zip has a command line interface. If I wanted to I could type `7z a` [`file.zip`](https://file.zip) `file.txt` in a terminal window to compress file.txt. However, this is not the default method and does not show up on the first page of a google search. Instead, I can right-click on file.txt in my file explorer, scroll down to 7-Zip in the pop-up menu, and select ""7-Zip > Add to [file.zip](https://file.zip)"". Alternatively, I could use the user-interface that comes pre-installed with 7-zip and compress it from there. Both methods are intuitive and do not require any typing. I don't understand why it's not possible to commit by right-clicking on a Git repository open in file explorer and selecting ""Git > Commit"" in the pop-up menu, or to add a file to the git index by selecting ""Git > Add"". 

I am aware that Git comes pre-installed with Git GUI on Windows, but it looks like it was made in a day using Tkinter. There's no reason for Git not to include a clean, user-friendly graphical interface as part of its default package. I am also aware there are third-party programs like GitKraken that provide a intuitive user-interface. However, the average person is likely deterred before even considering searching for a third-party solution.

To me, Git has always had a strange aura of gate-keeping around it, where it seems intentionally kept needlessly complicated. While it's not difficult to use once you get the hang of it, the initial complexity is kept in to make those who use it feel smarter than the average computer user. 

It's a true shame that Git is not widely accepted as the defacto version control software. Instead, software for non-programmers often have their own built-in VCS. Imagine if Microsoft Office had built in Git support like Visual Studio does? You could create a repository for a class and manage versions for notes, assignments, projects, etc from Word or Powerpoint.

If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read my mini-rant. I'm sure you're all ready to tell me how Git is actually intuitive and I'm just a slow learner in the comments lol.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Git is extremely useful tool for any type of project but its needless complexity makes it scary for people unfamiliar with software development to learn and use.

As an example if someone is a timid and ineffective wimp, what would looking inward do? They'd simply find the ineffectual wimp. If that same wimp decides ""wait I dont want to be this version of me, I want to be this other version"" then in a way they're more like donning a mask and embodying it.

I can't find a reason why companies choose to artificially limit their stock with products that people can, and will buy.   
Be it the NES/SNES mini, physical collectors' editions for games, art books, dakimakura covers, or literally anything else. There is no reason to not simply offer those items  on-demand after the campaign is over, and if they have a high production cost, the company can just up the price to the point it becomes profitable to sell them, it's not like that's gonna stop the people who really want it.  
I also have a similar opinion on products that are no longer manufactured like old consoles, phones, televisions etc., but that's besides the point of this post.

Now we get to digital limited editions/pre-order exclusive content...  
This is just plain idiocy. It's not like they can simply add said things as DLC, no. They need to sell to you the ""exclusivity"" of having a couple extra lines of code in the game you bought. Or, just having a couple of PNGs that apparently constitute as an ""Art book"".  
There is no way to limit digital content, people are going to either leak it (in the case of things that are standalone), or mod it into the software.

Now, for the conclusion, there is one type of artificial scarcity that I don't have as much of a problem with, and that's backer exclusive physical goods.  
This is because the people who get said products actually helped the project that they backed come into fruition. It is the way that the people who received crowdfunding thank their supporters, that believed in the project that was proposed. It's the way they can say ""It's thanks to you that we got this far.""  
Of course the scarcity is still purely artificial, and anyone with the design documents and contacts in manufacturing can still make them, but it's more about the connection between the backer and the product than the goods themselves.",unpopularopinion

I won't get into how I lost my teeth because it's embarassing and not the point of this discussion, so don't ask.

But anyways, at first it was gross but now that I'm used to it, I think it is superior than the normal method of consumption. It's less messy, you don't need utensils, and it's way easier and portable and it just tastes better. I no longer have to waste time eating breakfast, I can just blend it up and drink it along with my coffee on the way to work. Same for lunch and dinner. I don't need to carry a lunchbox, just a cup. I feel like it's easier to digest and I no longer have to deal with constipiasion, although I do admit that this diet does give me the squirts. That's the only downside.

I'm not a sciencetist or anything, but just think about it, the logic makes sense, right? Anyways, I digress.  In summary, blended food is:

* easier to digest
* tastes better once you get used to the texture

That being said, there really should be less of it. There should be more adult animated shows that don't do songs every episode.

A bit of background: I am subscribed to Amazon Prime, Costco, Max, and a local gym.

Subscription serves have been around for a long time, and no one used to complain. They just need to be worth their value to be worth it. For example, Costco has basically been a subscription service for decades. Yet you get your value in your subscription by the money you save by buying in bulk and all the sales. Another example of a good subscription service that has been around for a long time is Amazon Prime. If you are using Amazon frequently then it is worth it to have Prime for the quicker shipping.

The problem most people run into is when they are subscribing to services and not really using them. Which any person who is a normal adult can manage their money going in and out. 

When it comes to the streaming services, I much like this model over cable. I can pick and choose which streaming service I want to watch things from while not being subscribed to anything else.

703,1708898349.0,Ultimate Spiderman is the best spiderman,"Post is flagged with ""Spoiler"" because I kind of spoil the show ""Ultimate Spiderman"" a little bit on the post, so be aware of that

Most people say Tobey's Spiderman is the best live action Spiderman, and Spectacular is the best cartoon Spiderman, but I come here to digress. Ultimate Spiderman from the disney show is far better than any other version of spiderman i've ever seen. I know this is a really bold take, but this is the correct subreddit for this I think.

Most people really dislike the Ultimate Spiderman show, but I love it. The jokes are all awesome I don't think a single one of them is particularly bad, most are funny. The overall plot gets better throughout the seasons, and I love the Spiderverse episodes and Ultimate Goblin. I think the finale was perfect for the show also.

Overall, when I see Spiderman, this is the kind of spidey I want to see. Funny, making jokes mid battle, breaking the 4th wall. Serious at times when the plot demands it. Tobey doesn't make good jokes and Spectacular isn't on the level of Ultimate.

Tom Holland's Spiderman had a lot of potential but unfortunately they were held back by the other Spiderman movie series(Sam Raimi's and TASM) so they couldn't do something like a Spiderman: The Sinister Six movie which is what I wanted instead of No Way Home

IMO the 2nd best Spiderman is probably Insomniac's from the Marvel's Spiderman games, but that might be because they actually *did* get to do the Sinister Six thing, and it's hard for me to rate only the character forgetting that part. Oh also, Ultimate Spiderman also has several episodes where the Sinister Six come together, and also has in my opinion the best version of Carnage so far. I also love some of the side characters like Nova, Power Man and Agent Venom(Flash Thompson in this show).

I understand why some people may disagree, as they've grown up with more serious versions of the character, but I prefer light hearted spidey 90% of the time, and the other 10%, the same spidey but serious, like in the part where Ben Reilly(Scarlet Spider) reveals Peter's identity to Doc Ock

705,1708898110.0,Michael Jackson was most likely innocent,"Unsurprisingly a lot of people seem to have strong opinions about this issue. I've watched many documentaries from both sides and it seems to me none of the accusations hold much water.   
Michael Jackson didn't pay Jordan Chandler anything, his insurance company did. It was their choice, not Michael's. The settlement didn't prevent Jordan from testifying in criminal court, he just simply refused to. Jordan's own mother seems to think MJ was innocent and according to rumors Jordan himself has said his dad made him lie about those things and it was all for the money. The Leaving Neverland -documentary is filled with nonsense, like for example they claim he somehow committed crimes in Paris disneyland and Neverland train station years before they were even built.

754,1708814648.0,Git is needlessly complicated,"Git is an extremely useful tool to use when working on any kind of project but for the last 19 years it's been used almost exclusively by software developers. Git is not inherently limited to software projects and can be used as version control for really anything that involves storing files on a computer. Version control software, such as Git, should be as commonly understood by everyday computer users as internet browsers and antivirus software. Git's learning curve is unnecessary and is the main reason why it is not used by everyone. 

Take the command line for example, open up an internet browser and search ""git tutorial"" or ""how to get started with git"". Every tutorial starts by explaining how to use Git's command line interface. I understand that entering commands into a terminal is not technically ""coding"", but to the average person, it looks effectively the same. It's a significant entry barrier that discourages people unfamiliar with the concept to put in the effort to learn it. No other software commonly used by non-software developers requires the user to use the command line for every task. Imagine having to type `word save report.docx` in a terminal window every time you wanted to save in Microsoft Word, or `google revert` to go back a page in Google Chrome. I cannot understand why it is still the default way to interact with Git when it could easily be made to be more user friendly. 

For example, I often use the program ""7-zip"" to compress and decompress files. 7-zip has a command line interface. If I wanted to I could type `7z a` [`file.zip`](https://file.zip) `file.txt` in a terminal window to compress file.txt. However, this is not the default method and does not show up on the first page of a google search. Instead, I can right-click on file.txt in my file explorer, scroll down to 7-Zip in the pop-up menu, and select ""7-Zip > Add to [file.zip](https://file.zip)"". Alternatively, I could use the user-interface that comes pre-installed with 7-zip and compress it from there. Both methods are intuitive and do not require any typing. I don't understand why it's not possible to commit by right-clicking on a Git repository open in file explorer and selecting ""Git > Commit"" in the pop-up menu, or to add a file to the git index by selecting ""Git > Add"". 

I am aware that Git comes pre-installed with Git GUI on Windows, but it looks like it was made in a day using Tkinter. There's no reason for Git not to include a clean, user-friendly graphical interface as part of its default package. I am also aware there are third-party programs like GitKraken that provide a intuitive user-interface. However, the average person is likely deterred before even considering searching for a third-party solution.

To me, Git has always had a strange aura of gate-keeping around it, where it seems intentionally kept needlessly complicated. While it's not difficult to use once you get the hang of it, the initial complexity is kept in to make those who use it feel smarter than the average computer user. 

It's a true shame that Git is not widely accepted as the defacto version control software. Instead, software for non-programmers often have their own built-in VCS. Imagine if Microsoft Office had built in Git support like Visual Studio does? You could create a repository for a class and manage versions for notes, assignments, projects, etc from Word or Powerpoint.

If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read my mini-rant. I'm sure you're all ready to tell me how Git is actually intuitive and I'm just a slow learner in the comments lol.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Git is extremely useful tool for any type of project but its needless complexity makes it scary for people unfamiliar with software development to learn and use.

As an example if someone is a timid and ineffective wimp, what would looking inward do? They'd simply find the ineffectual wimp. If that same wimp decides ""wait I dont want to be this version of me, I want to be this other version"" then in a way they're more like donning a mask and embodying it. This isnt to say theres no examples of how something positive within you can be represses, but often from what I've seen focusing on our inner world rather than our actions in the real world is more like a form of mental masturbation than positive growth.

773,1708736636.0,Limited editions/first print editions make no sense economically.,"I get it, having something that you can't get anymore is cool, but that's it...

I can't find a reason why companies choose to artificially limit their stock with products that people can, and will buy.   
Be it the NES/SNES mini, physical collectors' editions for games, art books, dakimakura covers, or literally anything else. There is no reason to not simply offer those items  on-demand after the campaign is over, and if they have a high production cost, the company can just up the price to the point it becomes profitable to sell them, it's not like that's gonna stop the people who really want it.  
I also have a similar opinion on products that are no longer manufactured like old consoles, phones, televisions etc., but that's besides the point of this post.

Now we get to digital limited editions/pre-order exclusive content...  
This is just plain idiocy. It's not like they can simply add said things as DLC, no. They need to sell to you the ""exclusivity"" of having a couple extra lines of code in the game you bought. Or, just having a couple of PNGs that apparently constitute as an ""Art book"".  
There is no way to limit digital content, people are going to either leak it (in the case of things that are standalone), or mod it into the software.

Now, for the conclusion, there is one type of artificial scarcity that I don't have as much of a problem with, and that's backer exclusive physical goods.  
This is because the people who get said products actually helped the project that they backed come into fruition. It is the way that the people who received crowdfunding thank their supporters, that believed in the project that was proposed. It's the way they can say ""It's thanks to you that we got this far.""  
Of course the scarcity is still purely artificial, and anyone with the design documents and contacts in manufacturing can still make them, but it's more about the connection between the backer and the product than the goods themselves.",unpopularopinion

To me, it's a better flow in the evening than, for example, if one of us has to work late, the other cooks dinner and then there's this expectation of ""I did you the favor of cooking, now you can clean up the kitchen"". Maybe it makes sense transactionally, but our relationship isn't meant to feel transactional. Maybe it's just my perception of it that makes it feel that way.

Countless towns and regions have their own cultural identities, ways of life, dialects/accents, food traditions, architecture, and genetic makeup. There‚Äôs a varied mix of cities and towns- from charming historic to modern planned towns, industrial eyesores, etc. Anything you could possibly want. 

There‚Äôs a good mix of ancient and modern - interesting history is found on almost every corner spanning thousands of years that we can learn a lot of lessons from. But there‚Äôs also great nightlife, shopping, entertainment, developed infrastructure, etc.

The countryside is beautiful - lush green and tranquil. The number of walking/hiking trails is pretty remarkable and easily accessible, and there‚Äôs also an extensive rugged coastline to explore. 

The country just has a lot to offer and I shake my head at how the national image has been reduced to Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, football, and binge drinking whilst other countries receive praise for their range of culture, heritage, landscapes, etc.

795,1708638991.0,Blended foot is better and more convenient than unblended food.,"Recently, I had the unfortunate experience of losing all my teeth, which required me to blend all my food and drink it through one of those large bubble tea straws. I won't get into how I lost my teeth because it's embarassing and not the point of this discussion, so don't ask.

But anyways, at first it was gross but now that I'm used to it, I think it is superior than the normal method of consumption. It's less messy, you don't need utensils, and it's way easier and portable and it just tastes better. I no longer have to waste time eating breakfast, I can just blend it up and drink it along with my coffee on the way to work. Same for lunch and dinner. I don't need to carry a lunchbox, just a cup. I feel like it's easier to digest and I no longer have to deal with constipiasion, although I do admit that this diet does give me the squirts. That's the only downside. Still, the body does not need to waste energy breaking down the food, since it's already been broken down, therefore I have excess energy for other things like brainpower and muscle building. I'm not a sciencetist or anything, but just think about it, the logic makes sense, right? Anyways, I digress.  In summary, blended food is:

* more convinient
* easier to digest
* tastes better once you get used to the texture
* makes it easier to eat healthy foods you don't like, like brocolli and eggplant
* can mix with sodas and coffee, or gatorade if you're exercising and need energy
* is better overall

Edit: I mean food not foot.

798,1708614792.0,There's too much singing on modern mainstream animation.,"In general, there's nothing wrong with a musical animated show/movie. Some of my favorite shows like Bob's Burgers, the Simpsons, and Morel Oral have musical episodes, or devote time specifically for the characters to sing. It can be fun, especially if the voice actors can sing.  
  
That being said, there really should be less of it. There should be more adult animated shows that don't do songs every episode. Animated kid's shows/movies don't have to end in a dance party or sing to progress the plot. It seems like a factory standard to do it that way. (Especially in the West.)  
  
The Into the Spiderverse series is a great example of using music to enhance the experience. Miles singing along with the first song then not again for the rest of the movie was fun! It was a hint of his character, and we still got to experience the music! It's just one example, but there could be more that's done to keep music in without adding singing. 

It kind of seeps into indy animation as well. It's as though you can't have anything mainstream (or for general audiences) without it having the musical type progression.

799,1708582899.0,Darth Vader is an exemplary leader,"Everyone thinks of Darth Vader as the ruthless bad guy who kills everyone who opposes him. But he actually shows very strong leadership traits:

* While he is the most powerful individual in the Galactic Empire after the emperor, he does not lead from an ivory tower. He gets his hand dirty. A rebel fleet is attacking the Death Star? Not only he is in a fighter with his fellow pilots, he actually shoots down most of the enemy ships himself. He is in there to capture rebel leaders, to fight Obi Wan Kenobi, etc. He could very simply have sent a bunch of grunts, but instead he is in the action.
* He is humble and does not tolerate arrogance and bullshit. When everyone is bragging how badass the Death Star is, he brings everyone down to earth and remembers how it is insignificant in the grand scheme of things. And he was right.
* He is resourceful. He doesn't care about hiring bounty hunters, which the empire leadership considers ""scum"". He does what needs to be done to get the job done, and in that case, the job got done.
* He does not tolerate incompetence among people who were put in a leadership position. When he chokes the generals to death, it is not because of pure villainy. It is because his general's bad decisions put unnecessary risk to empire , like alerting the rebels the Empire is coming to Hoth (which required a ground assault, costing men's lives).
* He also takes the time to go personally to the guy who is building the new Death Star to warn him ""our boss is pissed,  you'd better go back to schedule"". He is a bro trying to help his buddy before it is too late.
* On the other hand he promotes individuals who are smart. Like the dude who read a strange signal from the probe droid which might have indicated the rebel base was in Hoth.

801,1708898838.0,"There is nothing wrong with subscription services, just the people who are choosing to buy them.","There is nothing wrong with subscription services. The issue is usually when people are grabbing all of them and never canceling.

A bit of background: I am subscribed to Amazon Prime, Costco, Max, and a local gym.

Subscription serves have been around for a long time, and no one used to complain. They just need to be worth their value to be worth it. For example, Costco has basically been a subscription service for decades. Yet you get your value in your subscription by the money you save by buying in bulk and all the sales. Another example of a good subscription service that has been around for a long time is Amazon Prime. If you are using Amazon frequently then it is worth it to have Prime for the quicker shipping.

The problem most people run into is when they are subscribing to services and not really using them. Which any person who is a normal adult can manage their money going in and out. 

When it comes to the streaming services, I much like this model over cable. I can pick and choose which streaming service I want to watch things from while not being subscribed to anything else. Right now I am working through Max content, and when I am ready for Disney+ I will pick that up for a few months and then cancel it. I dropped Netflix last year and will likely not pick it up again for another few years at this rate.

803,1708898349.0,Ultimate Spiderman is the best spiderman,"Post is flagged with ""Spoiler"" because I kind of spoil the show ""Ultimate Spiderman"" a little bit on the post, so be aware of that

Most people say Tobey's Spiderman is the best live action Spiderman, and Spectacular is the best cartoon Spiderman, but I come here to digress. Ultimate Spiderman from the disney show is far better than any other version of spiderman i've ever seen. I know this is a really bold take, but this is the correct subreddit for this I think.

Most people really dislike the Ultimate Spiderman show, but I love it. The jokes are all awesome I don't think a single one of them is particularly bad, most are funny. The overall plot gets better throughout the seasons, and I love the Spiderverse episodes and Ultimate Goblin. I think the finale was perfect for the show also.

Overall, when I see Spiderman, this is the kind of spidey I want to see. Funny, making jokes mid battle, breaking the 4th wall. Serious at times when the plot demands it. Tobey doesn't make good jokes and Spectacular isn't on the level of Ultimate.

Tom Holland's Spiderman had a lot of potential but unfortunately they were held back by the other Spiderman movie series(Sam Raimi's and TASM) so they couldn't do something like a Spiderman: The Sinister Six movie which is what I wanted instead of No Way Home

IMO the 2nd best Spiderman is probably Insomniac's from the Marvel's Spiderman games, but that might be because they actually *did* get to do the Sinister Six thing, and it's hard for me to rate only the character forgetting that part. Oh also, Ultimate Spiderman also has several episodes where the Sinister Six come together, and also has in my opinion the best version of Carnage so far. I also love some of the side characters like Nova, Power Man and Agent Venom(Flash Thompson in this show).

I understand why some people may disagree, as they've grown up with more serious versions of the character, but I prefer light hearted spidey 90% of the time, and the other 10%, the same spidey but serious, like in the part where Ben Reilly(Scarlet Spider) reveals Peter's identity to Doc Ock

Michael Jackson didn't pay Jordan Chandler anything, his insurance company did. It was their choice, not Michael's. The settlement didn't prevent Jordan from testifying in criminal court, he just simply refused to. Jordan's own mother seems to think MJ was innocent and according to rumors Jordan himself has said his dad made him lie about those things and it was all for the money.

The more muted colors from cel-animated stuff and a lot of digitally animated stuff from the 2000s(FOP S1, Ren and Stimpy, Danny Phantom, Animaniacs) look a lot nicer than most cartoons nowadays. Mind you, there are stuff I like the color palettes for that came out in recent years. Lupin the 3rd Part IV looks nice color-wise, and I enjoy the recent Dragon Ball stuff from Shintani recently(ex. Super: Broly), and that upcoming Ren and Stimpy reboot seems to be using colors closer to the original run(even if I wish the character animation was more expressive).

854,1708814648.0,Git is needlessly complicated,"Git is an extremely useful tool to use when working on any kind of project but for the last 19 years it's been used almost exclusively by software developers. Git is not inherently limited to software projects and can be used as version control for really anything that involves storing files on a computer. Version control software, such as Git, should be as commonly understood by everyday computer users as internet browsers and antivirus software. Git's learning curve is unnecessary and is the main reason why it is not used by everyone. 

Take the command line for example, open up an internet browser and search ""git tutorial"" or ""how to get started with git"". Every tutorial starts by explaining how to use Git's command line interface. I understand that entering commands into a terminal is not technically ""coding"", but to the average person, it looks effectively the same. It's a significant entry barrier that discourages people unfamiliar with the concept to put in the effort to learn it. No other software commonly used by non-software developers requires the user to use the command line for every task. Imagine having to type `word save report.docx` in a terminal window every time you wanted to save in Microsoft Word, or `google revert` to go back a page in Google Chrome. I cannot understand why it is still the default way to interact with Git when it could easily be made to be more user friendly. 

For example, I often use the program ""7-zip"" to compress and decompress files. 7-zip has a command line interface. If I wanted to I could type `7z a` [`file.zip`](https://file.zip) `file.txt` in a terminal window to compress file.txt. However, this is not the default method and does not show up on the first page of a google search. Instead, I can right-click on file.txt in my file explorer, scroll down to 7-Zip in the pop-up menu, and select ""7-Zip > Add to [file.zip](https://file.zip)"". Alternatively, I could use the user-interface that comes pre-installed with 7-zip and compress it from there. Both methods are intuitive and do not require any typing. I don't understand why it's not possible to commit by right-clicking on a Git repository open in file explorer and selecting ""Git > Commit"" in the pop-up menu, or to add a file to the git index by selecting ""Git > Add"". 

I am aware that Git comes pre-installed with Git GUI on Windows, but it looks like it was made in a day using Tkinter. There's no reason for Git not to include a clean, user-friendly graphical interface as part of its default package. I am also aware there are third-party programs like GitKraken that provide a intuitive user-interface. However, the average person is likely deterred before even considering searching for a third-party solution.

To me, Git has always had a strange aura of gate-keeping around it, where it seems intentionally kept needlessly complicated. While it's not difficult to use once you get the hang of it, the initial complexity is kept in to make those who use it feel smarter than the average computer user. 

It's a true shame that Git is not widely accepted as the defacto version control software. Instead, software for non-programmers often have their own built-in VCS. Imagine if Microsoft Office had built in Git support like Visual Studio does? You could create a repository for a class and manage versions for notes, assignments, projects, etc from Word or Powerpoint.

If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read my mini-rant. I'm sure you're all ready to tell me how Git is actually intuitive and I'm just a slow learner in the comments lol.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Git is extremely useful tool for any type of project but its needless complexity makes it scary for people unfamiliar with software development to learn and use.

I can't find a reason why companies choose to artificially limit their stock with products that people can, and will buy.   
Be it the NES/SNES mini, physical collectors' editions for games, art books, dakimakura covers, or literally anything else. There is no reason to not simply offer those items  on-demand after the campaign is over, and if they have a high production cost, the company can just up the price to the point it becomes profitable to sell them, it's not like that's gonna stop the people who really want it.  
I also have a similar opinion on products that are no longer manufactured like old consoles, phones, televisions etc., but that's besides the point of this post.

Now we get to digital limited editions/pre-order exclusive content...  
This is just plain idiocy. It's not like they can simply add said things as DLC, no. They need to sell to you the ""exclusivity"" of having a couple extra lines of code in the game you bought. Or, just having a couple of PNGs that apparently constitute as an ""Art book"".  
There is no way to limit digital content, people are going to either leak it (in the case of things that are standalone), or mod it into the software.

Now, for the conclusion, there is one type of artificial scarcity that I don't have as much of a problem with, and that's backer exclusive physical goods.  
This is because the people who get said products actually helped the project that they backed come into fruition. It is the way that the people who received crowdfunding thank their supporters, that believed in the project that was proposed. It's the way they can say ""It's thanks to you that we got this far.""

885,1708702177.0,Ketchup is only good on brats and burgers.,"When it comes to ketchup, I've found that it just doesn't align with my taste buds unless it's paired with burgers or bratwurst. The sweetness of ketchup tends to overpower other dishes, and fries are no exception. While some may enjoy the classic combination of fries and ketchup, I find that the sweetness of the condiment masks the natural flavors of the fries, diminishing the overall experience for me.Moreover, the intense flavor profile of ketchup tends to dominate dishes like fries or meatloaf, taking away from the enjoyment of the meal. For me, ketchup is best reserved for burgers and bratwurst, where its flavor complements the savory elements of the meat. Outside of these classic pairings, I'll pass on the ketchup and opt for other condiments or enjoy the dish as it is. It's all about personal preference, and for me, ketchup just doesn't work with fries or meatloaf.Change my mind. Give me a recipe that will change my view on ketchup.TLDR; Ketchup only works on burgers and brats. Fries or anything else with ketchup on it sucks. I would like a recipe that will change my mind.

They look down on people who get told what to do and aren't their own boss.  They're out there living the dream in their own mind looking down on employees.

Ironically, they're their own boss but are being told what to do by the customer and market demand.  If they truly did what they wanted to do and it didn't align with demand they'd go broke.

We're supposed to priase them for ""taking a risk"" to start their business, that's like praising a gambler for betting all of his money on black at the roulette table.  Or praising a well-off trust fund kid for starting something when there wasn't much risk to begin with.

You can get a surprisingly diverse experience as you travel around the country, and so I believe that most people can find something they like about it. 

Countless towns and regions have their own cultural identities, ways of life, dialects/accents, food traditions, architecture, and genetic makeup. There‚Äôs a varied mix of cities and towns- from charming historic to modern planned towns, industrial eyesores, etc. Anything you could possibly want. 

There‚Äôs a good mix of ancient and modern - interesting history is found on almost every corner spanning thousands of years that we can learn a lot of lessons from. But there‚Äôs also great nightlife, shopping, entertainment, developed infrastructure, etc.

The countryside is beautiful - lush green and tranquil. The number of walking/hiking trails is pretty remarkable and easily accessible, and there‚Äôs also an extensive rugged coastline to explore.

895,1708638991.0,Blended foot is better and more convenient than unblended food.,"Recently, I had the unfortunate experience of losing all my teeth, which required me to blend all my food and drink it through one of those large bubble tea straws. I won't get into how I lost my teeth because it's embarassing and not the point of this discussion, so don't ask.

But anyways, at first it was gross but now that I'm used to it, I think it is superior than the normal method of consumption. It's less messy, you don't need utensils, and it's way easier and portable and it just tastes better. I no longer have to waste time eating breakfast, I can just blend it up and drink it along with my coffee on the way to work. Same for lunch and dinner. I don't need to carry a lunchbox, just a cup. I feel like it's easier to digest and I no longer have to deal with constipiasion, although I do admit that this diet does give me the squirts. That's the only downside. Still, the body does not need to waste energy breaking down the food, since it's already been broken down, therefore I have excess energy for other things like brainpower and muscle building. I'm not a sciencetist or anything, but just think about it, the logic makes sense, right? Anyways, I digress.  In summary, blended food is:

* more convinient
* easier to digest
* tastes better once you get used to the texture
* makes it easier to eat healthy foods you don't like, like brocolli and eggplant
* can mix with sodas and coffee, or gatorade if you're exercising and need energy
* is better overall

898,1708614792.0,There's too much singing on modern mainstream animation.,"In general, there's nothing wrong with a musical animated show/movie. Some of my favorite shows like Bob's Burgers, the Simpsons, and Morel Oral have musical episodes, or devote time specifically for the characters to sing. It can be fun, especially if the voice actors can sing.  
  
That being said, there really should be less of it. There should be more adult animated shows that don't do songs every episode. Animated kid's shows/movies don't have to end in a dance party or sing to progress the plot. It seems like a factory standard to do it that way. (Especially in the West.)  
  
The Into the Spiderverse series is a great example of using music to enhance the experience. Miles singing along with the first song then not again for the rest of the movie was fun! It was a hint of his character, and we still got to experience the music! It's just one example, but there could be more that's done to keep music in without adding singing. 

It kind of seeps into indy animation as well. It's as though you can't have anything mainstream (or for general audiences) without it having the musical type progression.

He is in there to capture rebel leaders, to fight Obi Wan Kenobi, etc. He could very simply have sent a bunch of grunts, but instead he is in the action.
* He is humble and does not tolerate arrogance and bullshit. When everyone is bragging how badass the Death Star is, he brings everyone down to earth and remembers how it is insignificant in the grand scheme of things. And he was right.
* He is resourceful. He doesn't care about hiring bounty hunters, which the empire leadership considers ""scum"". He does what needs to be done to get the job done, and in that case, the job got done.
* He does not tolerate incompetence among people who were put in a leadership position. When he chokes the generals to death, it is not because of pure villainy. It is because his general's bad decisions put unnecessary risk to empire , like alerting the rebels the Empire is coming to Hoth (which required a ground assault, costing men's lives).
* He also takes the time to go personally to the guy who is building the new Death Star to warn him ""our boss is pissed,  you'd better go back to schedule"". He is a bro trying to help his buddy before it is too late.
* On the other hand he promotes individuals who are smart. Like the dude who read a strange signal from the probe droid which might have indicated the rebel base was in Hoth.

901,1708898838.0,"There is nothing wrong with subscription services, just the people who are choosing to buy them.","There is nothing wrong with subscription services. The issue is usually when people are grabbing all of them and never canceling.

A bit of background: I am subscribed to Amazon Prime, Costco, Max, and a local gym.

Subscription serves have been around for a long time, and no one used to complain. They just need to be worth their value to be worth it. For example, Costco has basically been a subscription service for decades. Yet you get your value in your subscription by the money you save by buying in bulk and all the sales. Another example of a good subscription service that has been around for a long time is Amazon Prime. If you are using Amazon frequently then it is worth it to have Prime for the quicker shipping.

The problem most people run into is when they are subscribing to services and not really using them. Which any person who is a normal adult can manage their money going in and out. 

When it comes to the streaming services, I much like this model over cable. I can pick and choose which streaming service I want to watch things from while not being subscribed to anything else. Right now I am working through Max content, and when I am ready for Disney+ I will pick that up for a few months and then cancel it. I dropped Netflix last year and will likely not pick it up again for another few years at this rate.

903,1708898349.0,Ultimate Spiderman is the best spiderman,"Post is flagged with ""Spoiler"" because I kind of spoil the show ""Ultimate Spiderman"" a little bit on the post, so be aware of that

Most people say Tobey's Spiderman is the best live action Spiderman, and Spectacular is the best cartoon Spiderman, but I come here to digress. Ultimate Spiderman from the disney show is far better than any other version of spiderman i've ever seen. I know this is a really bold take, but this is the correct subreddit for this I think.

Most people really dislike the Ultimate Spiderman show, but I love it. The jokes are all awesome I don't think a single one of them is particularly bad, most are funny. The overall plot gets better throughout the seasons, and I love the Spiderverse episodes and Ultimate Goblin. I think the finale was perfect for the show also.

Overall, when I see Spiderman, this is the kind of spidey I want to see. Funny, making jokes mid battle, breaking the 4th wall. Serious at times when the plot demands it. Tobey doesn't make good jokes and Spectacular isn't on the level of Ultimate.

Tom Holland's Spiderman had a lot of potential but unfortunately they were held back by the other Spiderman movie series(Sam Raimi's and TASM) so they couldn't do something like a Spiderman: The Sinister Six movie which is what I wanted instead of No Way Home

IMO the 2nd best Spiderman is probably Insomniac's from the Marvel's Spiderman games, but that might be because they actually *did* get to do the Sinister Six thing, and it's hard for me to rate only the character forgetting that part. Oh also, Ultimate Spiderman also has several episodes where the Sinister Six come together, and also has in my opinion the best version of Carnage so far. I also love some of the side characters like Nova, Power Man and Agent Venom(Flash Thompson in this show).

I understand why some people may disagree, as they've grown up with more serious versions of the character, but I prefer light hearted spidey 90% of the time, and the other 10%, the same spidey but serious, like in the part where Ben Reilly(Scarlet Spider) reveals Peter's identity to Doc Ock

At best, maybe it's an interesting curiosity of a folk artist adding some horns to a plodding melody.

I say this as someone who is a Dylan fan myself. I dig folk music in general and I've been a Dylan fan for many years, but this song in particular, I have always fucking hated it, to be honest. I mean, Bob Dylan has an extraordinary career, and his influences go way deeper than you might realize.

The more muted colors from cel-animated stuff and a lot of digitally animated stuff from the 2000s(FOP S1, Ren and Stimpy, Danny Phantom, Animaniacs) look a lot nicer than most cartoons nowadays. Mind you, there are stuff I like the color palettes for that came out in recent years. Lupin the 3rd Part IV looks nice color-wise, and I enjoy the recent Dragon Ball stuff from Shintani recently(ex.

954,1708814648.0,Git is needlessly complicated,"Git is an extremely useful tool to use when working on any kind of project but for the last 19 years it's been used almost exclusively by software developers. Git is not inherently limited to software projects and can be used as version control for really anything that involves storing files on a computer. Version control software, such as Git, should be as commonly understood by everyday computer users as internet browsers and antivirus software. Git's learning curve is unnecessary and is the main reason why it is not used by everyone. 

Take the command line for example, open up an internet browser and search ""git tutorial"" or ""how to get started with git"". Every tutorial starts by explaining how to use Git's command line interface. I understand that entering commands into a terminal is not technically ""coding"", but to the average person, it looks effectively the same. It's a significant entry barrier that discourages people unfamiliar with the concept to put in the effort to learn it. No other software commonly used by non-software developers requires the user to use the command line for every task. Imagine having to type `word save report.docx` in a terminal window every time you wanted to save in Microsoft Word, or `google revert` to go back a page in Google Chrome. I cannot understand why it is still the default way to interact with Git when it could easily be made to be more user friendly. 

For example, I often use the program ""7-zip"" to compress and decompress files. 7-zip has a command line interface. If I wanted to I could type `7z a` [`file.zip`](https://file.zip) `file.txt` in a terminal window to compress file.txt. However, this is not the default method and does not show up on the first page of a google search. Instead, I can right-click on file.txt in my file explorer, scroll down to 7-Zip in the pop-up menu, and select ""7-Zip > Add to [file.zip](https://file.zip)"". Alternatively, I could use the user-interface that comes pre-installed with 7-zip and compress it from there. Both methods are intuitive and do not require any typing. I don't understand why it's not possible to commit by right-clicking on a Git repository open in file explorer and selecting ""Git > Commit"" in the pop-up menu, or to add a file to the git index by selecting ""Git > Add"". 

I am aware that Git comes pre-installed with Git GUI on Windows, but it looks like it was made in a day using Tkinter. There's no reason for Git not to include a clean, user-friendly graphical interface as part of its default package. I am also aware there are third-party programs like GitKraken that provide a intuitive user-interface. However, the average person is likely deterred before even considering searching for a third-party solution.

To me, Git has always had a strange aura of gate-keeping around it, where it seems intentionally kept needlessly complicated. While it's not difficult to use once you get the hang of it, the initial complexity is kept in to make those who use it feel smarter than the average computer user. 

It's a true shame that Git is not widely accepted as the defacto version control software. Instead, software for non-programmers often have their own built-in VCS. Imagine if Microsoft Office had built in Git support like Visual Studio does? You could create a repository for a class and manage versions for notes, assignments, projects, etc from Word or Powerpoint.

If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read my mini-rant. I'm sure you're all ready to tell me how Git is actually intuitive and I'm just a slow learner in the comments lol.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Git is extremely useful tool for any type of project but its needless complexity makes it scary for people unfamiliar with software development to learn and use.

This isnt to say theres no examples of how something positive within you can be represses, but often from what I've seen focusing on our inner world rather than our actions in the real world is more like a form of mental masturbation than positive growth.

973,1708736636.0,Limited editions/first print editions make no sense economically.,"I get it, having something that you can't get anymore is cool, but that's it...

I can't find a reason why companies choose to artificially limit their stock with products that people can, and will buy.   
Be it the NES/SNES mini, physical collectors' editions for games, art books, dakimakura covers, or literally anything else. There is no reason to not simply offer those items  on-demand after the campaign is over, and if they have a high production cost, the company can just up the price to the point it becomes profitable to sell them, it's not like that's gonna stop the people who really want it.  
I also have a similar opinion on products that are no longer manufactured like old consoles, phones, televisions etc., but that's besides the point of this post.

Now we get to digital limited editions/pre-order exclusive content...  
This is just plain idiocy. It's not like they can simply add said things as DLC, no. They need to sell to you the ""exclusivity"" of having a couple extra lines of code in the game you bought. Or, just having a couple of PNGs that apparently constitute as an ""Art book"".  
There is no way to limit digital content, people are going to either leak it (in the case of things that are standalone), or mod it into the software.

Now, for the conclusion, there is one type of artificial scarcity that I don't have as much of a problem with, and that's backer exclusive physical goods.  
This is because the people who get said products actually helped the project that they backed come into fruition. It is the way that the people who received crowdfunding thank their supporters, that believed in the project that was proposed. It's the way they can say ""It's thanks to you that we got this far.""  
Of course the scarcity is still purely artificial, and anyone with the design documents and contacts in manufacturing can still make them, but it's more about the connection between the backer and the product than the goods themselves.",unpopularopinion

Maybe it makes sense transactionally, but our relationship isn't meant to feel transactional. Maybe it's just my perception of it that makes it feel that way.

I won't get into how I lost my teeth because it's embarassing and not the point of this discussion, so don't ask.

But anyways, at first it was gross but now that I'm used to it, I think it is superior than the normal method of consumption. It's less messy, you don't need utensils, and it's way easier and portable and it just tastes better. I no longer have to waste time eating breakfast, I can just blend it up and drink it along with my coffee on the way to work. Same for lunch and dinner. I don't need to carry a lunchbox, just a cup. I feel like it's easier to digest and I no longer have to deal with constipiasion, although I do admit that this diet does give me the squirts. That's the only downside. Still, the body does not need to waste energy breaking down the food, since it's already been broken down, therefore I have excess energy for other things like brainpower and muscle building. I'm not a sciencetist or anything, but just think about it, the logic makes sense, right? Anyways, I digress.  In summary, blended food is:

* easier to digest
* tastes better once you get used to the texture

It can be fun, especially if the voice actors can sing.  
  
That being said, there really should be less of it. There should be more adult animated shows that don't do songs every episode. Animated kid's shows/movies don't have to end in a dance party or sing to progress the plot. It seems like a factory standard to do it that way. (Especially in the West.)  
  
The Into the Spiderverse series is a great example of using music to enhance the experience. Miles singing along with the first song then not again for the rest of the movie was fun!

A bit of background: I am subscribed to Amazon Prime, Costco, Max, and a local gym.

Subscription serves have been around for a long time, and no one used to complain. They just need to be worth their value to be worth it. For example, Costco has basically been a subscription service for decades. Yet you get your value in your subscription by the money you save by buying in bulk and all the sales. Another example of a good subscription service that has been around for a long time is Amazon Prime. If you are using Amazon frequently then it is worth it to have Prime for the quicker shipping.

The problem most people run into is when they are subscribing to services and not really using them. Which any person who is a normal adult can manage their money going in and out. 

When it comes to the streaming services, I much like this model over cable. I can pick and choose which streaming service I want to watch things from while not being subscribed to anything else.

Most people say Tobey's Spiderman is the best live action Spiderman, and Spectacular is the best cartoon Spiderman, but I come here to digress. Ultimate Spiderman from the disney show is far better than any other version of spiderman i've ever seen. I know this is a really bold take, but this is the correct subreddit for this I think.

Most people really dislike the Ultimate Spiderman show, but I love it. The jokes are all awesome I don't think a single one of them is particularly bad, most are funny. The overall plot gets better throughout the seasons, and I love the Spiderverse episodes and Ultimate Goblin. I think the finale was perfect for the show also.

Overall, when I see Spiderman, this is the kind of spidey I want to see. Funny, making jokes mid battle, breaking the 4th wall. Serious at times when the plot demands it. Tobey doesn't make good jokes and Spectacular isn't on the level of Ultimate.

Tom Holland's Spiderman had a lot of potential but unfortunately they were held back by the other Spiderman movie series(Sam Raimi's and TASM) so they couldn't do something like a Spiderman: The Sinister Six movie which is what I wanted instead of No Way Home

IMO the 2nd best Spiderman is probably Insomniac's from the Marvel's Spiderman games, but that might be because they actually *did* get to do the Sinister Six thing, and it's hard for me to rate only the character forgetting that part. Oh also, Ultimate Spiderman also has several episodes where the Sinister Six come together, and also has in my opinion the best version of Carnage so far. I also love some of the side characters like Nova, Power Man and Agent Venom(Flash Thompson in this show).

I understand why some people may disagree, as they've grown up with more serious versions of the character, but I prefer light hearted spidey 90% of the time, and the other 10%, the same spidey but serious, like in the part where Ben Reilly(Scarlet Spider) reveals Peter's identity to Doc Ock

1054,1708814648.0,Git is needlessly complicated,"Git is an extremely useful tool to use when working on any kind of project but for the last 19 years it's been used almost exclusively by software developers. Git is not inherently limited to software projects and can be used as version control for really anything that involves storing files on a computer. Version control software, such as Git, should be as commonly understood by everyday computer users as internet browsers and antivirus software. Git's learning curve is unnecessary and is the main reason why it is not used by everyone. 

Take the command line for example, open up an internet browser and search ""git tutorial"" or ""how to get started with git"". Every tutorial starts by explaining how to use Git's command line interface. I understand that entering commands into a terminal is not technically ""coding"", but to the average person, it looks effectively the same. It's a significant entry barrier that discourages people unfamiliar with the concept to put in the effort to learn it. No other software commonly used by non-software developers requires the user to use the command line for every task. Imagine having to type `word save report.docx` in a terminal window every time you wanted to save in Microsoft Word, or `google revert` to go back a page in Google Chrome. I cannot understand why it is still the default way to interact with Git when it could easily be made to be more user friendly. 

For example, I often use the program ""7-zip"" to compress and decompress files. 7-zip has a command line interface. If I wanted to I could type `7z a` [`file.zip`](https://file.zip) `file.txt` in a terminal window to compress file.txt. However, this is not the default method and does not show up on the first page of a google search. Instead, I can right-click on file.txt in my file explorer, scroll down to 7-Zip in the pop-up menu, and select ""7-Zip > Add to [file.zip](https://file.zip)"". Alternatively, I could use the user-interface that comes pre-installed with 7-zip and compress it from there. Both methods are intuitive and do not require any typing. I don't understand why it's not possible to commit by right-clicking on a Git repository open in file explorer and selecting ""Git > Commit"" in the pop-up menu, or to add a file to the git index by selecting ""Git > Add"". 

I am aware that Git comes pre-installed with Git GUI on Windows, but it looks like it was made in a day using Tkinter. There's no reason for Git not to include a clean, user-friendly graphical interface as part of its default package. I am also aware there are third-party programs like GitKraken that provide a intuitive user-interface. However, the average person is likely deterred before even considering searching for a third-party solution.

To me, Git has always had a strange aura of gate-keeping around it, where it seems intentionally kept needlessly complicated. While it's not difficult to use once you get the hang of it, the initial complexity is kept in to make those who use it feel smarter than the average computer user. 

It's a true shame that Git is not widely accepted as the defacto version control software. Instead, software for non-programmers often have their own built-in VCS. Imagine if Microsoft Office had built in Git support like Visual Studio does? You could create a repository for a class and manage versions for notes, assignments, projects, etc from Word or Powerpoint.

If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read my mini-rant. I'm sure you're all ready to tell me how Git is actually intuitive and I'm just a slow learner in the comments lol.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Git is extremely useful tool for any type of project but its needless complexity makes it scary for people unfamiliar with software development to learn and use.

For example, Tenet took a perfectly original and interesting high concept sci-fi premise and turned it into an unpleasant experience with  muddled storytelling and cheesy dialogue. Same with Inception, Interstellar and honestly almost all of his later work. 

It seemed to get progressively worse the more mainstream success he has seen, and contrasts starkly with his earlier work which I consider to be far superior, especially Memento. One exception was The Prestige, which I found to be an above average, easily digestible thriller with solid performances and period details.

As an example if someone is a timid and ineffective wimp, what would looking inward do? They'd simply find the ineffectual wimp. If that same wimp decides ""wait I dont want to be this version of me, I want to be this other version"" then in a way they're more like donning a mask and embodying it. This isnt to say theres no examples of how something positive within you can be represses, but often from what I've seen focusing on our inner world rather than our actions in the real world is more like a form of mental masturbation than positive growth.

1073,1708736636.0,Limited editions/first print editions make no sense economically.,"I get it, having something that you can't get anymore is cool, but that's it...

I can't find a reason why companies choose to artificially limit their stock with products that people can, and will buy.   
Be it the NES/SNES mini, physical collectors' editions for games, art books, dakimakura covers, or literally anything else. There is no reason to not simply offer those items  on-demand after the campaign is over, and if they have a high production cost, the company can just up the price to the point it becomes profitable to sell them, it's not like that's gonna stop the people who really want it.  
I also have a similar opinion on products that are no longer manufactured like old consoles, phones, televisions etc., but that's besides the point of this post.

Now we get to digital limited editions/pre-order exclusive content...  
This is just plain idiocy. It's not like they can simply add said things as DLC, no. They need to sell to you the ""exclusivity"" of having a couple extra lines of code in the game you bought. Or, just having a couple of PNGs that apparently constitute as an ""Art book"".  
There is no way to limit digital content, people are going to either leak it (in the case of things that are standalone), or mod it into the software.

Now, for the conclusion, there is one type of artificial scarcity that I don't have as much of a problem with, and that's backer exclusive physical goods.  
This is because the people who get said products actually helped the project that they backed come into fruition. It is the way that the people who received crowdfunding thank their supporters, that believed in the project that was proposed. It's the way they can say ""It's thanks to you that we got this far.""  
Of course the scarcity is still purely artificial, and anyone with the design documents and contacts in manufacturing can still make them, but it's more about the connection between the backer and the product than the goods themselves.",unpopularopinion

To me, it's a better flow in the evening than, for example, if one of us has to work late, the other cooks dinner and then there's this expectation of ""I did you the favor of cooking, now you can clean up the kitchen"". Maybe it makes sense transactionally, but our relationship isn't meant to feel transactional. Maybe it's just my perception of it that makes it feel that way.

I won't get into how I lost my teeth because it's embarassing and not the point of this discussion, so don't ask.

But anyways, at first it was gross but now that I'm used to it, I think it is superior than the normal method of consumption. It's less messy, you don't need utensils, and it's way easier and portable and it just tastes better. I no longer have to waste time eating breakfast, I can just blend it up and drink it along with my coffee on the way to work. Same for lunch and dinner. I don't need to carry a lunchbox, just a cup. I feel like it's easier to digest and I no longer have to deal with constipiasion, although I do admit that this diet does give me the squirts. That's the only downside. Still, the body does not need to waste energy breaking down the food, since it's already been broken down, therefore I have excess energy for other things like brainpower and muscle building. I'm not a sciencetist or anything, but just think about it, the logic makes sense, right? Anyways, I digress.  In summary, blended food is:

* more convinient
* easier to digest
* tastes better once you get used to the texture
* makes it easier to eat healthy foods you don't like, like brocolli and eggplant

The Into the Spiderverse series is a great example of using music to enhance the experience. Miles singing along with the first song then not again for the rest of the movie was fun! It was a hint of his character, and we still got to experience the music! It's just one example, but there could be more that's done to keep music in without adding singing. 

It kind of seeps into indy animation as well. It's as though you can't have anything mainstream (or for general audiences) without it having the musical type progression.

1099,1708582899.0,Darth Vader is an exemplary leader,"Everyone thinks of Darth Vader as the ruthless bad guy who kills everyone who opposes him. But he actually shows very strong leadership traits:

* While he is the most powerful individual in the Galactic Empire after the emperor, he does not lead from an ivory tower. He gets his hand dirty. A rebel fleet is attacking the Death Star? Not only he is in a fighter with his fellow pilots, he actually shoots down most of the enemy ships himself. He is in there to capture rebel leaders, to fight Obi Wan Kenobi, etc. He could very simply have sent a bunch of grunts, but instead he is in the action.
* He is humble and does not tolerate arrogance and bullshit. When everyone is bragging how badass the Death Star is, he brings everyone down to earth and remembers how it is insignificant in the grand scheme of things. And he was right.
* He is resourceful. He doesn't care about hiring bounty hunters, which the empire leadership considers ""scum"". He does what needs to be done to get the job done, and in that case, the job got done.
* He does not tolerate incompetence among people who were put in a leadership position. When he chokes the generals to death, it is not because of pure villainy. It is because his general's bad decisions put unnecessary risk to empire , like alerting the rebels the Empire is coming to Hoth (which required a ground assault, costing men's lives).
* He also takes the time to go personally to the guy who is building the new Death Star to warn him ""our boss is pissed,  you'd better go back to schedule"". He is a bro trying to help his buddy before it is too late.
* On the other hand he promotes individuals who are smart. Like the dude who read a strange signal from the probe droid which might have indicated the rebel base was in Hoth.

If you are smart and humble, you will do fine by having him to your side while crushing the rebel scum.",unpopularopinion

1101,1708898838.0,"There is nothing wrong with subscription services, just the people who are choosing to buy them.","There is nothing wrong with subscription services. The issue is usually when people are grabbing all of them and never canceling.

A bit of background: I am subscribed to Amazon Prime, Costco, Max, and a local gym.

Subscription serves have been around for a long time, and no one used to complain. They just need to be worth their value to be worth it. For example, Costco has basically been a subscription service for decades. Yet you get your value in your subscription by the money you save by buying in bulk and all the sales. Another example of a good subscription service that has been around for a long time is Amazon Prime. If you are using Amazon frequently then it is worth it to have Prime for the quicker shipping.

The problem most people run into is when they are subscribing to services and not really using them. Which any person who is a normal adult can manage their money going in and out. 

When it comes to the streaming services, I much like this model over cable. I can pick and choose which streaming service I want to watch things from while not being subscribed to anything else. Right now I am working through Max content, and when I am ready for Disney+ I will pick that up for a few months and then cancel it. I dropped Netflix last year and will likely not pick it up again for another few years at this rate.

1103,1708898349.0,Ultimate Spiderman is the best spiderman,"Post is flagged with ""Spoiler"" because I kind of spoil the show ""Ultimate Spiderman"" a little bit on the post, so be aware of that

Most people say Tobey's Spiderman is the best live action Spiderman, and Spectacular is the best cartoon Spiderman, but I come here to digress. Ultimate Spiderman from the disney show is far better than any other version of spiderman i've ever seen. I know this is a really bold take, but this is the correct subreddit for this I think.

Most people really dislike the Ultimate Spiderman show, but I love it. The jokes are all awesome I don't think a single one of them is particularly bad, most are funny. The overall plot gets better throughout the seasons, and I love the Spiderverse episodes and Ultimate Goblin. I think the finale was perfect for the show also.

Overall, when I see Spiderman, this is the kind of spidey I want to see. Funny, making jokes mid battle, breaking the 4th wall. Serious at times when the plot demands it. Tobey doesn't make good jokes and Spectacular isn't on the level of Ultimate.

Tom Holland's Spiderman had a lot of potential but unfortunately they were held back by the other Spiderman movie series(Sam Raimi's and TASM) so they couldn't do something like a Spiderman: The Sinister Six movie which is what I wanted instead of No Way Home

IMO the 2nd best Spiderman is probably Insomniac's from the Marvel's Spiderman games, but that might be because they actually *did* get to do the Sinister Six thing, and it's hard for me to rate only the character forgetting that part. Oh also, Ultimate Spiderman also has several episodes where the Sinister Six come together, and also has in my opinion the best version of Carnage so far. I also love some of the side characters like Nova, Power Man and Agent Venom(Flash Thompson in this show).

I understand why some people may disagree, as they've grown up with more serious versions of the character, but I prefer light hearted spidey 90% of the time, and the other 10%, the same spidey but serious, like in the part where Ben Reilly(Scarlet Spider) reveals Peter's identity to Doc Ock

Michael Jackson didn't pay Jordan Chandler anything, his insurance company did. It was their choice, not Michael's. The settlement didn't prevent Jordan from testifying in criminal court, he just simply refused to. Jordan's own mother seems to think MJ was innocent and according to rumors Jordan himself has said his dad made him lie about those things and it was all for the money.

1151,1708818603.0,Symbolism in media is not that important,"  
I think some people simply love movies or series loaded with symbolism and forget that symbolism isn't **that** important.  
  
  
For example, while watching Breaking Bad and noticing the Color Theory was fun, at the end of the day, it's just a detail. The show was good because of the characters, the plot, and the execution. Not because ""Wow! Gus wears **red** when he's about to do something **violent**, that's so **deep**!""  
  
  
And then there are some movies and series that seem to ignore that besides this symbolism, you need a structure that doesn't depend on it to remain solid. I can name a few series like that here: Midsommar, Hereditary, Evangelion, Zima Blue (episode from ""Love, Death & Robots""), some episodes of Black Mirror.

1154,1708814648.0,Git is needlessly complicated,"Git is an extremely useful tool to use when working on any kind of project but for the last 19 years it's been used almost exclusively by software developers. Git is not inherently limited to software projects and can be used as version control for really anything that involves storing files on a computer. Version control software, such as Git, should be as commonly understood by everyday computer users as internet browsers and antivirus software. Git's learning curve is unnecessary and is the main reason why it is not used by everyone. 

Take the command line for example, open up an internet browser and search ""git tutorial"" or ""how to get started with git"". Every tutorial starts by explaining how to use Git's command line interface. I understand that entering commands into a terminal is not technically ""coding"", but to the average person, it looks effectively the same. It's a significant entry barrier that discourages people unfamiliar with the concept to put in the effort to learn it. No other software commonly used by non-software developers requires the user to use the command line for every task. Imagine having to type `word save report.docx` in a terminal window every time you wanted to save in Microsoft Word, or `google revert` to go back a page in Google Chrome. I cannot understand why it is still the default way to interact with Git when it could easily be made to be more user friendly. 

For example, I often use the program ""7-zip"" to compress and decompress files. 7-zip has a command line interface. If I wanted to I could type `7z a` [`file.zip`](https://file.zip) `file.txt` in a terminal window to compress file.txt. However, this is not the default method and does not show up on the first page of a google search. Instead, I can right-click on file.txt in my file explorer, scroll down to 7-Zip in the pop-up menu, and select ""7-Zip > Add to [file.zip](https://file.zip)"". Alternatively, I could use the user-interface that comes pre-installed with 7-zip and compress it from there. Both methods are intuitive and do not require any typing. I don't understand why it's not possible to commit by right-clicking on a Git repository open in file explorer and selecting ""Git > Commit"" in the pop-up menu, or to add a file to the git index by selecting ""Git > Add"". 

I am aware that Git comes pre-installed with Git GUI on Windows, but it looks like it was made in a day using Tkinter. There's no reason for Git not to include a clean, user-friendly graphical interface as part of its default package. I am also aware there are third-party programs like GitKraken that provide a intuitive user-interface. However, the average person is likely deterred before even considering searching for a third-party solution.

To me, Git has always had a strange aura of gate-keeping around it, where it seems intentionally kept needlessly complicated. While it's not difficult to use once you get the hang of it, the initial complexity is kept in to make those who use it feel smarter than the average computer user. 

It's a true shame that Git is not widely accepted as the defacto version control software. Instead, software for non-programmers often have their own built-in VCS. Imagine if Microsoft Office had built in Git support like Visual Studio does? You could create a repository for a class and manage versions for notes, assignments, projects, etc from Word or Powerpoint.

If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read my mini-rant. I'm sure you're all ready to tell me how Git is actually intuitive and I'm just a slow learner in the comments lol.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Git is extremely useful tool for any type of project but its needless complexity makes it scary for people unfamiliar with software development to learn and use.

1173,1708736636.0,Limited editions/first print editions make no sense economically.,"I get it, having something that you can't get anymore is cool, but that's it...

I can't find a reason why companies choose to artificially limit their stock with products that people can, and will buy.   
Be it the NES/SNES mini, physical collectors' editions for games, art books, dakimakura covers, or literally anything else. There is no reason to not simply offer those items  on-demand after the campaign is over, and if they have a high production cost, the company can just up the price to the point it becomes profitable to sell them, it's not like that's gonna stop the people who really want it.  
I also have a similar opinion on products that are no longer manufactured like old consoles, phones, televisions etc., but that's besides the point of this post.

Now we get to digital limited editions/pre-order exclusive content...  
This is just plain idiocy. It's not like they can simply add said things as DLC, no. They need to sell to you the ""exclusivity"" of having a couple extra lines of code in the game you bought. Or, just having a couple of PNGs that apparently constitute as an ""Art book"".  
There is no way to limit digital content, people are going to either leak it (in the case of things that are standalone), or mod it into the software.

Now, for the conclusion, there is one type of artificial scarcity that I don't have as much of a problem with, and that's backer exclusive physical goods.  
This is because the people who get said products actually helped the project that they backed come into fruition. It is the way that the people who received crowdfunding thank their supporters, that believed in the project that was proposed. It's the way they can say ""It's thanks to you that we got this far.""

1188,1708674282.0,Small business owners are often insufferable people,"They look down on people who don't own their own business.  Think of all of the times you heard the phrase ""I want to be my own boss"" or "" I don't want anyone telling me what to do"" or they want out of the 9 to 5 rat race.  They look down on people who get told what to do and aren't their own boss.  They're out there living the dream in their own mind looking down on employees.

Ironically, they're their own boss but are being told what to do by the customer and market demand.  If they truly did what they wanted to do and it didn't align with demand they'd go broke.

We're supposed to priase them for ""taking a risk"" to start their business, that's like praising a gambler for betting all of his money on black at the roulette table.  Or praising a well-off trust fund kid for starting something when there wasn't much risk to begin with.

Not to mention small business owners could easily be criminals.  Why don't they want to work for a company?  A criminal record?

Another example: skateshops.  People say buy from your local skateshop, but sometimes the owners of those shops are elitist pricks who look down on beginners.

There‚Äôs so much more to the country than just London. I‚Äôve spent most of my life travelling around the UK and I think England ticks the boxes for most of the things people praise other countries for. 

You can get a surprisingly diverse experience as you travel around the country, and so I believe that most people can find something they like about it. 

Countless towns and regions have their own cultural identities, ways of life, dialects/accents, food traditions, architecture, and genetic makeup. There‚Äôs a varied mix of cities and towns- from charming historic to modern planned towns, industrial eyesores, etc. Anything you could possibly want. 

There‚Äôs a good mix of ancient and modern - interesting history is found on almost every corner spanning thousands of years that we can learn a lot of lessons from. But there‚Äôs also great nightlife, shopping, entertainment, developed infrastructure, etc.

The countryside is beautiful - lush green and tranquil. The number of walking/hiking trails is pretty remarkable and easily accessible, and there‚Äôs also an extensive rugged coastline to explore. 

The country just has a lot to offer and I shake my head at how the national image has been reduced to Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, football, and binge drinking whilst other countries receive praise for their range of culture, heritage, landscapes, etc.

1195,1708638991.0,Blended foot is better and more convenient than unblended food.,"Recently, I had the unfortunate experience of losing all my teeth, which required me to blend all my food and drink it through one of those large bubble tea straws. I won't get into how I lost my teeth because it's embarassing and not the point of this discussion, so don't ask.

But anyways, at first it was gross but now that I'm used to it, I think it is superior than the normal method of consumption. It's less messy, you don't need utensils, and it's way easier and portable and it just tastes better. I no longer have to waste time eating breakfast, I can just blend it up and drink it along with my coffee on the way to work. Same for lunch and dinner. I don't need to carry a lunchbox, just a cup. I feel like it's easier to digest and I no longer have to deal with constipiasion, although I do admit that this diet does give me the squirts. That's the only downside. Still, the body does not need to waste energy breaking down the food, since it's already been broken down, therefore I have excess energy for other things like brainpower and muscle building. I'm not a sciencetist or anything, but just think about it, the logic makes sense, right? Anyways, I digress.  In summary, blended food is:

* more convinient
* easier to digest
* tastes better once you get used to the texture
* makes it easier to eat healthy foods you don't like, like brocolli and eggplant
* can mix with sodas and coffee, or gatorade if you're exercising and need energy
* is better overall

1198,1708614792.0,There's too much singing on modern mainstream animation.,"In general, there's nothing wrong with a musical animated show/movie. Some of my favorite shows like Bob's Burgers, the Simpsons, and Morel Oral have musical episodes, or devote time specifically for the characters to sing. It can be fun, especially if the voice actors can sing.  
  
That being said, there really should be less of it. There should be more adult animated shows that don't do songs every episode. Animated kid's shows/movies don't have to end in a dance party or sing to progress the plot. It seems like a factory standard to do it that way. (Especially in the West.)  
  
The Into the Spiderverse series is a great example of using music to enhance the experience. Miles singing along with the first song then not again for the rest of the movie was fun! It was a hint of his character, and we still got to experience the music! It's just one example, but there could be more that's done to keep music in without adding singing. 

It kind of seeps into indy animation as well. It's as though you can't have anything mainstream (or for general audiences) without it having the musical type progression.

* While he is the most powerful individual in the Galactic Empire after the emperor, he does not lead from an ivory tower. He gets his hand dirty. A rebel fleet is attacking the Death Star? Not only he is in a fighter with his fellow pilots, he actually shoots down most of the enemy ships himself. He is in there to capture rebel leaders, to fight Obi Wan Kenobi, etc. He could very simply have sent a bunch of grunts, but instead he is in the action.
* He is humble and does not tolerate arrogance and bullshit. When everyone is bragging how badass the Death Star is, he brings everyone down to earth and remembers how it is insignificant in the grand scheme of things. And he was right.
* He is resourceful. He doesn't care about hiring bounty hunters, which the empire leadership considers ""scum"". He does what needs to be done to get the job done, and in that case, the job got done.
* He does not tolerate incompetence among people who were put in a leadership position. When he chokes the generals to death, it is not because of pure villainy. It is because his general's bad decisions put unnecessary risk to empire , like alerting the rebels the Empire is coming to Hoth (which required a ground assault, costing men's lives).
* He also takes the time to go personally to the guy who is building the new Death Star to warn him ""our boss is pissed,  you'd better go back to schedule"". He is a bro trying to help his buddy before it is too late.
* On the other hand he promotes individuals who are smart. Like the dude who read a strange signal from the probe droid which might have indicated the rebel base was in Hoth.

1201,1708898838.0,"There is nothing wrong with subscription services, just the people who are choosing to buy them.","There is nothing wrong with subscription services. The issue is usually when people are grabbing all of them and never canceling.

A bit of background: I am subscribed to Amazon Prime, Costco, Max, and a local gym.

Subscription serves have been around for a long time, and no one used to complain. They just need to be worth their value to be worth it. For example, Costco has basically been a subscription service for decades. Yet you get your value in your subscription by the money you save by buying in bulk and all the sales. Another example of a good subscription service that has been around for a long time is Amazon Prime. If you are using Amazon frequently then it is worth it to have Prime for the quicker shipping.

The problem most people run into is when they are subscribing to services and not really using them. Which any person who is a normal adult can manage their money going in and out. 

When it comes to the streaming services, I much like this model over cable. I can pick and choose which streaming service I want to watch things from while not being subscribed to anything else. Right now I am working through Max content, and when I am ready for Disney+ I will pick that up for a few months and then cancel it. I dropped Netflix last year and will likely not pick it up again for another few years at this rate.

1203,1708898349.0,Ultimate Spiderman is the best spiderman,"Post is flagged with ""Spoiler"" because I kind of spoil the show ""Ultimate Spiderman"" a little bit on the post, so be aware of that

Most people say Tobey's Spiderman is the best live action Spiderman, and Spectacular is the best cartoon Spiderman, but I come here to digress. Ultimate Spiderman from the disney show is far better than any other version of spiderman i've ever seen. I know this is a really bold take, but this is the correct subreddit for this I think.

Most people really dislike the Ultimate Spiderman show, but I love it. The jokes are all awesome I don't think a single one of them is particularly bad, most are funny. The overall plot gets better throughout the seasons, and I love the Spiderverse episodes and Ultimate Goblin. I think the finale was perfect for the show also.

Overall, when I see Spiderman, this is the kind of spidey I want to see. Funny, making jokes mid battle, breaking the 4th wall. Serious at times when the plot demands it. Tobey doesn't make good jokes and Spectacular isn't on the level of Ultimate.

Tom Holland's Spiderman had a lot of potential but unfortunately they were held back by the other Spiderman movie series(Sam Raimi's and TASM) so they couldn't do something like a Spiderman: The Sinister Six movie which is what I wanted instead of No Way Home

IMO the 2nd best Spiderman is probably Insomniac's from the Marvel's Spiderman games, but that might be because they actually *did* get to do the Sinister Six thing, and it's hard for me to rate only the character forgetting that part. Oh also, Ultimate Spiderman also has several episodes where the Sinister Six come together, and also has in my opinion the best version of Carnage so far. I also love some of the side characters like Nova, Power Man and Agent Venom(Flash Thompson in this show).

I understand why some people may disagree, as they've grown up with more serious versions of the character, but I prefer light hearted spidey 90% of the time, and the other 10%, the same spidey but serious, like in the part where Ben Reilly(Scarlet Spider) reveals Peter's identity to Doc Ock

The more muted colors from cel-animated stuff and a lot of digitally animated stuff from the 2000s(FOP S1, Ren and Stimpy, Danny Phantom, Animaniacs) look a lot nicer than most cartoons nowadays. Mind you, there are stuff I like the color palettes for that came out in recent years. Lupin the 3rd Part IV looks nice color-wise, and I enjoy the recent Dragon Ball stuff from Shintani recently(ex.

And then there are some movies and series that seem to ignore that besides this symbolism, you need a structure that doesn't depend on it to remain solid.

1254,1708814648.0,Git is needlessly complicated,"Git is an extremely useful tool to use when working on any kind of project but for the last 19 years it's been used almost exclusively by software developers. Git is not inherently limited to software projects and can be used as version control for really anything that involves storing files on a computer. Version control software, such as Git, should be as commonly understood by everyday computer users as internet browsers and antivirus software. Git's learning curve is unnecessary and is the main reason why it is not used by everyone. 

Take the command line for example, open up an internet browser and search ""git tutorial"" or ""how to get started with git"". Every tutorial starts by explaining how to use Git's command line interface. I understand that entering commands into a terminal is not technically ""coding"", but to the average person, it looks effectively the same. It's a significant entry barrier that discourages people unfamiliar with the concept to put in the effort to learn it. No other software commonly used by non-software developers requires the user to use the command line for every task. Imagine having to type `word save report.docx` in a terminal window every time you wanted to save in Microsoft Word, or `google revert` to go back a page in Google Chrome. I cannot understand why it is still the default way to interact with Git when it could easily be made to be more user friendly. 

For example, I often use the program ""7-zip"" to compress and decompress files. 7-zip has a command line interface. If I wanted to I could type `7z a` [`file.zip`](https://file.zip) `file.txt` in a terminal window to compress file.txt. However, this is not the default method and does not show up on the first page of a google search. Instead, I can right-click on file.txt in my file explorer, scroll down to 7-Zip in the pop-up menu, and select ""7-Zip > Add to [file.zip](https://file.zip)"". Alternatively, I could use the user-interface that comes pre-installed with 7-zip and compress it from there. Both methods are intuitive and do not require any typing. I don't understand why it's not possible to commit by right-clicking on a Git repository open in file explorer and selecting ""Git > Commit"" in the pop-up menu, or to add a file to the git index by selecting ""Git > Add"". 

I am aware that Git comes pre-installed with Git GUI on Windows, but it looks like it was made in a day using Tkinter. There's no reason for Git not to include a clean, user-friendly graphical interface as part of its default package. I am also aware there are third-party programs like GitKraken that provide a intuitive user-interface. However, the average person is likely deterred before even considering searching for a third-party solution.

To me, Git has always had a strange aura of gate-keeping around it, where it seems intentionally kept needlessly complicated. While it's not difficult to use once you get the hang of it, the initial complexity is kept in to make those who use it feel smarter than the average computer user. 

It's a true shame that Git is not widely accepted as the defacto version control software. Instead, software for non-programmers often have their own built-in VCS. Imagine if Microsoft Office had built in Git support like Visual Studio does? You could create a repository for a class and manage versions for notes, assignments, projects, etc from Word or Powerpoint.

If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read my mini-rant. I'm sure you're all ready to tell me how Git is actually intuitive and I'm just a slow learner in the comments lol.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Git is extremely useful tool for any type of project but its needless complexity makes it scary for people unfamiliar with software development to learn and use.

I can't find a reason why companies choose to artificially limit their stock with products that people can, and will buy.   
Be it the NES/SNES mini, physical collectors' editions for games, art books, dakimakura covers, or literally anything else. There is no reason to not simply offer those items  on-demand after the campaign is over, and if they have a high production cost, the company can just up the price to the point it becomes profitable to sell them, it's not like that's gonna stop the people who really want it.  
I also have a similar opinion on products that are no longer manufactured like old consoles, phones, televisions etc., but that's besides the point of this post.

Now we get to digital limited editions/pre-order exclusive content...  
This is just plain idiocy. It's not like they can simply add said things as DLC, no. They need to sell to you the ""exclusivity"" of having a couple extra lines of code in the game you bought. Or, just having a couple of PNGs that apparently constitute as an ""Art book"".  
There is no way to limit digital content, people are going to either leak it (in the case of things that are standalone), or mod it into the software.

Now, for the conclusion, there is one type of artificial scarcity that I don't have as much of a problem with, and that's backer exclusive physical goods.  
This is because the people who get said products actually helped the project that they backed come into fruition. It is the way that the people who received crowdfunding thank their supporters, that believed in the project that was proposed. It's the way they can say ""It's thanks to you that we got this far.""

To me, it's a better flow in the evening than, for example, if one of us has to work late, the other cooks dinner and then there's this expectation of ""I did you the favor of cooking, now you can clean up the kitchen"". Maybe it makes sense transactionally, but our relationship isn't meant to feel transactional. Maybe it's just my perception of it that makes it feel that way.

While some may enjoy the classic combination of fries and ketchup, I find that the sweetness of the condiment masks the natural flavors of the fries, diminishing the overall experience for me.Moreover, the intense flavor profile of ketchup tends to dominate dishes like fries or meatloaf, taking away from the enjoyment of the meal. For me, ketchup is best reserved for burgers and bratwurst, where its flavor complements the savory elements of the meat.

I won't get into how I lost my teeth because it's embarassing and not the point of this discussion, so don't ask.

But anyways, at first it was gross but now that I'm used to it, I think it is superior than the normal method of consumption. It's less messy, you don't need utensils, and it's way easier and portable and it just tastes better. I no longer have to waste time eating breakfast, I can just blend it up and drink it along with my coffee on the way to work. Same for lunch and dinner. I don't need to carry a lunchbox, just a cup. I feel like it's easier to digest and I no longer have to deal with constipiasion, although I do admit that this diet does give me the squirts. That's the only downside. Still, the body does not need to waste energy breaking down the food, since it's already been broken down, therefore I have excess energy for other things like brainpower and muscle building. I'm not a sciencetist or anything, but just think about it, the logic makes sense, right? Anyways, I digress.  In summary, blended food is:

* more convinient
* easier to digest
* tastes better once you get used to the texture
* makes it easier to eat healthy foods you don't like, like brocolli and eggplant
* can mix with sodas and coffee, or gatorade if you're exercising and need energy

Some of my favorite shows like Bob's Burgers, the Simpsons, and Morel Oral have musical episodes, or devote time specifically for the characters to sing. It can be fun, especially if the voice actors can sing.  
  
That being said, there really should be less of it. There should be more adult animated shows that don't do songs every episode. Animated kid's shows/movies don't have to end in a dance party or sing to progress the plot. It seems like a factory standard to do it that way. (Especially in the West.)  
  
The Into the Spiderverse series is a great example of using music to enhance the experience. Miles singing along with the first song then not again for the rest of the movie was fun! It was a hint of his character, and we still got to experience the music! It's just one example, but there could be more that's done to keep music in without adding singing.

* He is resourceful. He doesn't care about hiring bounty hunters, which the empire leadership considers ""scum"". He does what needs to be done to get the job done, and in that case, the job got done.
* He does not tolerate incompetence among people who were put in a leadership position. When he chokes the generals to death, it is not because of pure villainy. It is because his general's bad decisions put unnecessary risk to empire , like alerting the rebels the Empire is coming to Hoth (which required a ground assault, costing men's lives).
* He also takes the time to go personally to the guy who is building the new Death Star to warn him ""our boss is pissed,  you'd better go back to schedule"". He is a bro trying to help his buddy before it is too late.

A bit of background: I am subscribed to Amazon Prime, Costco, Max, and a local gym.

Subscription serves have been around for a long time, and no one used to complain. They just need to be worth their value to be worth it. For example, Costco has basically been a subscription service for decades. Yet you get your value in your subscription by the money you save by buying in bulk and all the sales. Another example of a good subscription service that has been around for a long time is Amazon Prime. If you are using Amazon frequently then it is worth it to have Prime for the quicker shipping.

The problem most people run into is when they are subscribing to services and not really using them. Which any person who is a normal adult can manage their money going in and out. 

When it comes to the streaming services, I much like this model over cable. I can pick and choose which streaming service I want to watch things from while not being subscribed to anything else.

Most people say Tobey's Spiderman is the best live action Spiderman, and Spectacular is the best cartoon Spiderman, but I come here to digress. Ultimate Spiderman from the disney show is far better than any other version of spiderman i've ever seen. I know this is a really bold take, but this is the correct subreddit for this I think.

Most people really dislike the Ultimate Spiderman show, but I love it. The jokes are all awesome I don't think a single one of them is particularly bad, most are funny. The overall plot gets better throughout the seasons, and I love the Spiderverse episodes and Ultimate Goblin. I think the finale was perfect for the show also.

Overall, when I see Spiderman, this is the kind of spidey I want to see. Funny, making jokes mid battle, breaking the 4th wall. Serious at times when the plot demands it. Tobey doesn't make good jokes and Spectacular isn't on the level of Ultimate.

Tom Holland's Spiderman had a lot of potential but unfortunately they were held back by the other Spiderman movie series(Sam Raimi's and TASM) so they couldn't do something like a Spiderman: The Sinister Six movie which is what I wanted instead of No Way Home

IMO the 2nd best Spiderman is probably Insomniac's from the Marvel's Spiderman games, but that might be because they actually *did* get to do the Sinister Six thing, and it's hard for me to rate only the character forgetting that part. Oh also, Ultimate Spiderman also has several episodes where the Sinister Six come together, and also has in my opinion the best version of Carnage so far. I also love some of the side characters like Nova, Power Man and Agent Venom(Flash Thompson in this show).

I understand why some people may disagree, as they've grown up with more serious versions of the character, but I prefer light hearted spidey 90% of the time, and the other 10%, the same spidey but serious, like in the part where Ben Reilly(Scarlet Spider) reveals Peter's identity to Doc Ock

The more muted colors from cel-animated stuff and a lot of digitally animated stuff from the 2000s(FOP S1, Ren and Stimpy, Danny Phantom, Animaniacs) look a lot nicer than most cartoons nowadays. Mind you, there are stuff I like the color palettes for that came out in recent years. Lupin the 3rd Part IV looks nice color-wise, and I enjoy the recent Dragon Ball stuff from Shintani recently(ex.

1354,1708814648.0,Git is needlessly complicated,"Git is an extremely useful tool to use when working on any kind of project but for the last 19 years it's been used almost exclusively by software developers. Git is not inherently limited to software projects and can be used as version control for really anything that involves storing files on a computer. Version control software, such as Git, should be as commonly understood by everyday computer users as internet browsers and antivirus software. Git's learning curve is unnecessary and is the main reason why it is not used by everyone. 

Take the command line for example, open up an internet browser and search ""git tutorial"" or ""how to get started with git"". Every tutorial starts by explaining how to use Git's command line interface. I understand that entering commands into a terminal is not technically ""coding"", but to the average person, it looks effectively the same. It's a significant entry barrier that discourages people unfamiliar with the concept to put in the effort to learn it. No other software commonly used by non-software developers requires the user to use the command line for every task. Imagine having to type `word save report.docx` in a terminal window every time you wanted to save in Microsoft Word, or `google revert` to go back a page in Google Chrome. I cannot understand why it is still the default way to interact with Git when it could easily be made to be more user friendly. 

For example, I often use the program ""7-zip"" to compress and decompress files. 7-zip has a command line interface. If I wanted to I could type `7z a` [`file.zip`](https://file.zip) `file.txt` in a terminal window to compress file.txt. However, this is not the default method and does not show up on the first page of a google search. Instead, I can right-click on file.txt in my file explorer, scroll down to 7-Zip in the pop-up menu, and select ""7-Zip > Add to [file.zip](https://file.zip)"". Alternatively, I could use the user-interface that comes pre-installed with 7-zip and compress it from there. Both methods are intuitive and do not require any typing. I don't understand why it's not possible to commit by right-clicking on a Git repository open in file explorer and selecting ""Git > Commit"" in the pop-up menu, or to add a file to the git index by selecting ""Git > Add"". 

I am aware that Git comes pre-installed with Git GUI on Windows, but it looks like it was made in a day using Tkinter. There's no reason for Git not to include a clean, user-friendly graphical interface as part of its default package. I am also aware there are third-party programs like GitKraken that provide a intuitive user-interface. However, the average person is likely deterred before even considering searching for a third-party solution.

To me, Git has always had a strange aura of gate-keeping around it, where it seems intentionally kept needlessly complicated. While it's not difficult to use once you get the hang of it, the initial complexity is kept in to make those who use it feel smarter than the average computer user. 

It's a true shame that Git is not widely accepted as the defacto version control software. Instead, software for non-programmers often have their own built-in VCS. Imagine if Microsoft Office had built in Git support like Visual Studio does? You could create a repository for a class and manage versions for notes, assignments, projects, etc from Word or Powerpoint.

If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read my mini-rant. I'm sure you're all ready to tell me how Git is actually intuitive and I'm just a slow learner in the comments lol.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Git is extremely useful tool for any type of project but its needless complexity makes it scary for people unfamiliar with software development to learn and use.

I can't find a reason why companies choose to artificially limit their stock with products that people can, and will buy.   
Be it the NES/SNES mini, physical collectors' editions for games, art books, dakimakura covers, or literally anything else. There is no reason to not simply offer those items  on-demand after the campaign is over, and if they have a high production cost, the company can just up the price to the point it becomes profitable to sell them, it's not like that's gonna stop the people who really want it.  
I also have a similar opinion on products that are no longer manufactured like old consoles, phones, televisions etc., but that's besides the point of this post.

Now we get to digital limited editions/pre-order exclusive content...  
This is just plain idiocy. It's not like they can simply add said things as DLC, no. They need to sell to you the ""exclusivity"" of having a couple extra lines of code in the game you bought. Or, just having a couple of PNGs that apparently constitute as an ""Art book"".  
There is no way to limit digital content, people are going to either leak it (in the case of things that are standalone), or mod it into the software.

Now, for the conclusion, there is one type of artificial scarcity that I don't have as much of a problem with, and that's backer exclusive physical goods.  
This is because the people who get said products actually helped the project that they backed come into fruition. It is the way that the people who received crowdfunding thank their supporters, that believed in the project that was proposed. It's the way they can say ""It's thanks to you that we got this far.""  
Of course the scarcity is still purely artificial, and anyone with the design documents and contacts in manufacturing can still make them, but it's more about the connection between the backer and the product than the goods themselves.",unpopularopinion

Maybe it makes sense transactionally, but our relationship isn't meant to feel transactional. Maybe it's just my perception of it that makes it feel that way.

I won't get into how I lost my teeth because it's embarassing and not the point of this discussion, so don't ask.

But anyways, at first it was gross but now that I'm used to it, I think it is superior than the normal method of consumption. It's less messy, you don't need utensils, and it's way easier and portable and it just tastes better. I no longer have to waste time eating breakfast, I can just blend it up and drink it along with my coffee on the way to work. Same for lunch and dinner. I don't need to carry a lunchbox, just a cup. I feel like it's easier to digest and I no longer have to deal with constipiasion, although I do admit that this diet does give me the squirts. That's the only downside. Still, the body does not need to waste energy breaking down the food, since it's already been broken down, therefore I have excess energy for other things like brainpower and muscle building. I'm not a sciencetist or anything, but just think about it, the logic makes sense, right? Anyways, I digress.  In summary, blended food is:

* more convinient
* easier to digest
* tastes better once you get used to the texture

That being said, there really should be less of it. There should be more adult animated shows that don't do songs every episode. Animated kid's shows/movies don't have to end in a dance party or sing to progress the plot. It seems like a factory standard to do it that way. (Especially in the West.)  
  
The Into the Spiderverse series is a great example of using music to enhance the experience. Miles singing along with the first song then not again for the rest of the movie was fun!

* He does not tolerate incompetence among people who were put in a leadership position. When he chokes the generals to death, it is not because of pure villainy. It is because his general's bad decisions put unnecessary risk to empire , like alerting the rebels the Empire is coming to Hoth (which required a ground assault, costing men's lives).

A bit of background: I am subscribed to Amazon Prime, Costco, Max, and a local gym.

Subscription serves have been around for a long time, and no one used to complain. They just need to be worth their value to be worth it. For example, Costco has basically been a subscription service for decades. Yet you get your value in your subscription by the money you save by buying in bulk and all the sales. Another example of a good subscription service that has been around for a long time is Amazon Prime. If you are using Amazon frequently then it is worth it to have Prime for the quicker shipping.

The problem most people run into is when they are subscribing to services and not really using them. Which any person who is a normal adult can manage their money going in and out. 

When it comes to the streaming services, I much like this model over cable. I can pick and choose which streaming service I want to watch things from while not being subscribed to anything else. Right now I am working through Max content, and when I am ready for Disney+ I will pick that up for a few months and then cancel it. I dropped Netflix last year and will likely not pick it up again for another few years at this rate.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**: Subscription services are overall good if you can manage yourself and make sure you cancel them when you don't need them.",unpopularopinion

1403,1708898349.0,Ultimate Spiderman is the best spiderman,"Post is flagged with ""Spoiler"" because I kind of spoil the show ""Ultimate Spiderman"" a little bit on the post, so be aware of that

Most people say Tobey's Spiderman is the best live action Spiderman, and Spectacular is the best cartoon Spiderman, but I come here to digress. Ultimate Spiderman from the disney show is far better than any other version of spiderman i've ever seen. I know this is a really bold take, but this is the correct subreddit for this I think.

Most people really dislike the Ultimate Spiderman show, but I love it. The jokes are all awesome I don't think a single one of them is particularly bad, most are funny. The overall plot gets better throughout the seasons, and I love the Spiderverse episodes and Ultimate Goblin. I think the finale was perfect for the show also.

Overall, when I see Spiderman, this is the kind of spidey I want to see. Funny, making jokes mid battle, breaking the 4th wall. Serious at times when the plot demands it. Tobey doesn't make good jokes and Spectacular isn't on the level of Ultimate.

Tom Holland's Spiderman had a lot of potential but unfortunately they were held back by the other Spiderman movie series(Sam Raimi's and TASM) so they couldn't do something like a Spiderman: The Sinister Six movie which is what I wanted instead of No Way Home

IMO the 2nd best Spiderman is probably Insomniac's from the Marvel's Spiderman games, but that might be because they actually *did* get to do the Sinister Six thing, and it's hard for me to rate only the character forgetting that part. Oh also, Ultimate Spiderman also has several episodes where the Sinister Six come together, and also has in my opinion the best version of Carnage so far. I also love some of the side characters like Nova, Power Man and Agent Venom(Flash Thompson in this show).

I understand why some people may disagree, as they've grown up with more serious versions of the character, but I prefer light hearted spidey 90% of the time, and the other 10%, the same spidey but serious, like in the part where Ben Reilly(Scarlet Spider) reveals Peter's identity to Doc Ock

Michael Jackson didn't pay Jordan Chandler anything, his insurance company did. It was their choice, not Michael's. The settlement didn't prevent Jordan from testifying in criminal court, he just simply refused to. Jordan's own mother seems to think MJ was innocent and according to rumors Jordan himself has said his dad made him lie about those things and it was all for the money. The Leaving Neverland -documentary is filled with nonsense, like for example they claim he somehow committed crimes in Paris disneyland and Neverland train station years before they were even built.

Not because ""Wow! Gus wears **red** when he's about to do something **violent**, that's so **deep**!""  
  
  
And then there are some movies and series that seem to ignore that besides this symbolism, you need a structure that doesn't depend on it to remain solid. I can name a few series like that here: Midsommar, Hereditary, Evangelion, Zima Blue (episode from ""Love, Death & Robots""), some episodes of Black Mirror.  
  
  
And when you try to understand why the person liked the movie, they usually talk about a thousand and one things that the movie represents, but the movie itself seems to become secondary in the discussion. If they don't say the infamous quote ""Too deep for you."".",unpopularopinion

I am a strong believer that people should be selfish.

1454,1708814648.0,Git is needlessly complicated,"Git is an extremely useful tool to use when working on any kind of project but for the last 19 years it's been used almost exclusively by software developers. Git is not inherently limited to software projects and can be used as version control for really anything that involves storing files on a computer. Version control software, such as Git, should be as commonly understood by everyday computer users as internet browsers and antivirus software. Git's learning curve is unnecessary and is the main reason why it is not used by everyone. 

Take the command line for example, open up an internet browser and search ""git tutorial"" or ""how to get started with git"". Every tutorial starts by explaining how to use Git's command line interface. I understand that entering commands into a terminal is not technically ""coding"", but to the average person, it looks effectively the same. It's a significant entry barrier that discourages people unfamiliar with the concept to put in the effort to learn it. No other software commonly used by non-software developers requires the user to use the command line for every task. Imagine having to type `word save report.docx` in a terminal window every time you wanted to save in Microsoft Word, or `google revert` to go back a page in Google Chrome. I cannot understand why it is still the default way to interact with Git when it could easily be made to be more user friendly. 

For example, I often use the program ""7-zip"" to compress and decompress files. 7-zip has a command line interface. If I wanted to I could type `7z a` [`file.zip`](https://file.zip) `file.txt` in a terminal window to compress file.txt. However, this is not the default method and does not show up on the first page of a google search. Instead, I can right-click on file.txt in my file explorer, scroll down to 7-Zip in the pop-up menu, and select ""7-Zip > Add to [file.zip](https://file.zip)"". Alternatively, I could use the user-interface that comes pre-installed with 7-zip and compress it from there. Both methods are intuitive and do not require any typing. I don't understand why it's not possible to commit by right-clicking on a Git repository open in file explorer and selecting ""Git > Commit"" in the pop-up menu, or to add a file to the git index by selecting ""Git > Add"". 

I am aware that Git comes pre-installed with Git GUI on Windows, but it looks like it was made in a day using Tkinter. There's no reason for Git not to include a clean, user-friendly graphical interface as part of its default package. I am also aware there are third-party programs like GitKraken that provide a intuitive user-interface. However, the average person is likely deterred before even considering searching for a third-party solution.

To me, Git has always had a strange aura of gate-keeping around it, where it seems intentionally kept needlessly complicated. While it's not difficult to use once you get the hang of it, the initial complexity is kept in to make those who use it feel smarter than the average computer user. 

It's a true shame that Git is not widely accepted as the defacto version control software. Instead, software for non-programmers often have their own built-in VCS. Imagine if Microsoft Office had built in Git support like Visual Studio does? You could create a repository for a class and manage versions for notes, assignments, projects, etc from Word or Powerpoint.

If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read my mini-rant. I'm sure you're all ready to tell me how Git is actually intuitive and I'm just a slow learner in the comments lol.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Git is extremely useful tool for any type of project but its needless complexity makes it scary for people unfamiliar with software development to learn and use.

As an example if someone is a timid and ineffective wimp, what would looking inward do? They'd simply find the ineffectual wimp.

1473,1708736636.0,Limited editions/first print editions make no sense economically.,"I get it, having something that you can't get anymore is cool, but that's it...

I can't find a reason why companies choose to artificially limit their stock with products that people can, and will buy.   
Be it the NES/SNES mini, physical collectors' editions for games, art books, dakimakura covers, or literally anything else. There is no reason to not simply offer those items  on-demand after the campaign is over, and if they have a high production cost, the company can just up the price to the point it becomes profitable to sell them, it's not like that's gonna stop the people who really want it.  
I also have a similar opinion on products that are no longer manufactured like old consoles, phones, televisions etc., but that's besides the point of this post.

Now we get to digital limited editions/pre-order exclusive content...  
This is just plain idiocy. It's not like they can simply add said things as DLC, no. They need to sell to you the ""exclusivity"" of having a couple extra lines of code in the game you bought. Or, just having a couple of PNGs that apparently constitute as an ""Art book"".  
There is no way to limit digital content, people are going to either leak it (in the case of things that are standalone), or mod it into the software.

Now, for the conclusion, there is one type of artificial scarcity that I don't have as much of a problem with, and that's backer exclusive physical goods.  
This is because the people who get said products actually helped the project that they backed come into fruition. It is the way that the people who received crowdfunding thank their supporters, that believed in the project that was proposed. It's the way they can say ""It's thanks to you that we got this far.""  
Of course the scarcity is still purely artificial, and anyone with the design documents and contacts in manufacturing can still make them, but it's more about the connection between the backer and the product than the goods themselves.",unpopularopinion

Maybe it makes sense transactionally, but our relationship isn't meant to feel transactional. Maybe it's just my perception of it that makes it feel that way.

There‚Äôs so much more to the country than just London. I‚Äôve spent most of my life travelling around the UK and I think England ticks the boxes for most of the things people praise other countries for. 

You can get a surprisingly diverse experience as you travel around the country, and so I believe that most people can find something they like about it. 

Countless towns and regions have their own cultural identities, ways of life, dialects/accents, food traditions, architecture, and genetic makeup. There‚Äôs a varied mix of cities and towns- from charming historic to modern planned towns, industrial eyesores, etc. Anything you could possibly want. 

There‚Äôs a good mix of ancient and modern - interesting history is found on almost every corner spanning thousands of years that we can learn a lot of lessons from. But there‚Äôs also great nightlife, shopping, entertainment, developed infrastructure, etc.

The countryside is beautiful - lush green and tranquil. The number of walking/hiking trails is pretty remarkable and easily accessible, and there‚Äôs also an extensive rugged coastline to explore. 

The country just has a lot to offer and I shake my head at how the national image has been reduced to Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, football, and binge drinking whilst other countries receive praise for their range of culture, heritage, landscapes, etc.

1495,1708638991.0,Blended foot is better and more convenient than unblended food.,"Recently, I had the unfortunate experience of losing all my teeth, which required me to blend all my food and drink it through one of those large bubble tea straws. I won't get into how I lost my teeth because it's embarassing and not the point of this discussion, so don't ask.

But anyways, at first it was gross but now that I'm used to it, I think it is superior than the normal method of consumption. It's less messy, you don't need utensils, and it's way easier and portable and it just tastes better. I no longer have to waste time eating breakfast, I can just blend it up and drink it along with my coffee on the way to work. Same for lunch and dinner. I don't need to carry a lunchbox, just a cup. I feel like it's easier to digest and I no longer have to deal with constipiasion, although I do admit that this diet does give me the squirts. That's the only downside. Still, the body does not need to waste energy breaking down the food, since it's already been broken down, therefore I have excess energy for other things like brainpower and muscle building. I'm not a sciencetist or anything, but just think about it, the logic makes sense, right? Anyways, I digress.  In summary, blended food is:

* more convinient
* easier to digest
* tastes better once you get used to the texture
* makes it easier to eat healthy foods you don't like, like brocolli and eggplant
* can mix with sodas and coffee, or gatorade if you're exercising and need energy
* is better overall

1498,1708614792.0,There's too much singing on modern mainstream animation.,"In general, there's nothing wrong with a musical animated show/movie. Some of my favorite shows like Bob's Burgers, the Simpsons, and Morel Oral have musical episodes, or devote time specifically for the characters to sing. It can be fun, especially if the voice actors can sing.  
  
That being said, there really should be less of it. There should be more adult animated shows that don't do songs every episode. Animated kid's shows/movies don't have to end in a dance party or sing to progress the plot. It seems like a factory standard to do it that way. (Especially in the West.)  
  
The Into the Spiderverse series is a great example of using music to enhance the experience. Miles singing along with the first song then not again for the rest of the movie was fun! It was a hint of his character, and we still got to experience the music! It's just one example, but there could be more that's done to keep music in without adding singing. 

It kind of seeps into indy animation as well. It's as though you can't have anything mainstream (or for general audiences) without it having the musical type progression.

1499,1708582899.0,Darth Vader is an exemplary leader,"Everyone thinks of Darth Vader as the ruthless bad guy who kills everyone who opposes him. But he actually shows very strong leadership traits:

* While he is the most powerful individual in the Galactic Empire after the emperor, he does not lead from an ivory tower. He gets his hand dirty. A rebel fleet is attacking the Death Star? Not only he is in a fighter with his fellow pilots, he actually shoots down most of the enemy ships himself. He is in there to capture rebel leaders, to fight Obi Wan Kenobi, etc. He could very simply have sent a bunch of grunts, but instead he is in the action.
* He is humble and does not tolerate arrogance and bullshit. When everyone is bragging how badass the Death Star is, he brings everyone down to earth and remembers how it is insignificant in the grand scheme of things. And he was right.
* He is resourceful. He doesn't care about hiring bounty hunters, which the empire leadership considers ""scum"". He does what needs to be done to get the job done, and in that case, the job got done.
* He does not tolerate incompetence among people who were put in a leadership position. When he chokes the generals to death, it is not because of pure villainy. It is because his general's bad decisions put unnecessary risk to empire , like alerting the rebels the Empire is coming to Hoth (which required a ground assault, costing men's lives).
* He also takes the time to go personally to the guy who is building the new Death Star to warn him ""our boss is pissed,  you'd better go back to schedule"". He is a bro trying to help his buddy before it is too late.
* On the other hand he promotes individuals who are smart. Like the dude who read a strange signal from the probe droid which might have indicated the rebel base was in Hoth.

1501,1708898838.0,"There is nothing wrong with subscription services, just the people who are choosing to buy them.","There is nothing wrong with subscription services. The issue is usually when people are grabbing all of them and never canceling.

A bit of background: I am subscribed to Amazon Prime, Costco, Max, and a local gym.

Subscription serves have been around for a long time, and no one used to complain. They just need to be worth their value to be worth it. For example, Costco has basically been a subscription service for decades. Yet you get your value in your subscription by the money you save by buying in bulk and all the sales. Another example of a good subscription service that has been around for a long time is Amazon Prime. If you are using Amazon frequently then it is worth it to have Prime for the quicker shipping.

The problem most people run into is when they are subscribing to services and not really using them. Which any person who is a normal adult can manage their money going in and out. 

When it comes to the streaming services, I much like this model over cable. I can pick and choose which streaming service I want to watch things from while not being subscribed to anything else. Right now I am working through Max content, and when I am ready for Disney+ I will pick that up for a few months and then cancel it. I dropped Netflix last year and will likely not pick it up again for another few years at this rate.

1503,1708898349.0,Ultimate Spiderman is the best spiderman,"Post is flagged with ""Spoiler"" because I kind of spoil the show ""Ultimate Spiderman"" a little bit on the post, so be aware of that

Most people say Tobey's Spiderman is the best live action Spiderman, and Spectacular is the best cartoon Spiderman, but I come here to digress. Ultimate Spiderman from the disney show is far better than any other version of spiderman i've ever seen. I know this is a really bold take, but this is the correct subreddit for this I think.

Most people really dislike the Ultimate Spiderman show, but I love it. The jokes are all awesome I don't think a single one of them is particularly bad, most are funny. The overall plot gets better throughout the seasons, and I love the Spiderverse episodes and Ultimate Goblin. I think the finale was perfect for the show also.

Overall, when I see Spiderman, this is the kind of spidey I want to see. Funny, making jokes mid battle, breaking the 4th wall. Serious at times when the plot demands it. Tobey doesn't make good jokes and Spectacular isn't on the level of Ultimate.

Tom Holland's Spiderman had a lot of potential but unfortunately they were held back by the other Spiderman movie series(Sam Raimi's and TASM) so they couldn't do something like a Spiderman: The Sinister Six movie which is what I wanted instead of No Way Home

IMO the 2nd best Spiderman is probably Insomniac's from the Marvel's Spiderman games, but that might be because they actually *did* get to do the Sinister Six thing, and it's hard for me to rate only the character forgetting that part. Oh also, Ultimate Spiderman also has several episodes where the Sinister Six come together, and also has in my opinion the best version of Carnage so far. I also love some of the side characters like Nova, Power Man and Agent Venom(Flash Thompson in this show).

I understand why some people may disagree, as they've grown up with more serious versions of the character, but I prefer light hearted spidey 90% of the time, and the other 10%, the same spidey but serious, like in the part where Ben Reilly(Scarlet Spider) reveals Peter's identity to Doc Ock

Michael Jackson didn't pay Jordan Chandler anything, his insurance company did. It was their choice, not Michael's.

Reasons I like the Depp Version:

1. It's more accurate to Roald Dahl's book.
2. The cinematography and mise-en-scene in this movie is just perfect.
3. Wonka's backstory was a perfect addition to this movie. It added Depth to Wonka's character that I can relate to.

The more muted colors from cel-animated stuff and a lot of digitally animated stuff from the 2000s(FOP S1, Ren and Stimpy, Danny Phantom, Animaniacs) look a lot nicer than most cartoons nowadays. Mind you, there are stuff I like the color palettes for that came out in recent years. Lupin the 3rd Part IV looks nice color-wise, and I enjoy the recent Dragon Ball stuff from Shintani recently(ex.

And then there are some movies and series that seem to ignore that besides this symbolism, you need a structure that doesn't depend on it to remain solid.

1554,1708814648.0,Git is needlessly complicated,"Git is an extremely useful tool to use when working on any kind of project but for the last 19 years it's been used almost exclusively by software developers. Git is not inherently limited to software projects and can be used as version control for really anything that involves storing files on a computer. Version control software, such as Git, should be as commonly understood by everyday computer users as internet browsers and antivirus software. Git's learning curve is unnecessary and is the main reason why it is not used by everyone. 

Take the command line for example, open up an internet browser and search ""git tutorial"" or ""how to get started with git"". Every tutorial starts by explaining how to use Git's command line interface. I understand that entering commands into a terminal is not technically ""coding"", but to the average person, it looks effectively the same. It's a significant entry barrier that discourages people unfamiliar with the concept to put in the effort to learn it. No other software commonly used by non-software developers requires the user to use the command line for every task. Imagine having to type `word save report.docx` in a terminal window every time you wanted to save in Microsoft Word, or `google revert` to go back a page in Google Chrome. I cannot understand why it is still the default way to interact with Git when it could easily be made to be more user friendly. 

For example, I often use the program ""7-zip"" to compress and decompress files. 7-zip has a command line interface. If I wanted to I could type `7z a` [`file.zip`](https://file.zip) `file.txt` in a terminal window to compress file.txt. However, this is not the default method and does not show up on the first page of a google search. Instead, I can right-click on file.txt in my file explorer, scroll down to 7-Zip in the pop-up menu, and select ""7-Zip > Add to [file.zip](https://file.zip)"". Alternatively, I could use the user-interface that comes pre-installed with 7-zip and compress it from there. Both methods are intuitive and do not require any typing. I don't understand why it's not possible to commit by right-clicking on a Git repository open in file explorer and selecting ""Git > Commit"" in the pop-up menu, or to add a file to the git index by selecting ""Git > Add"". 

I am aware that Git comes pre-installed with Git GUI on Windows, but it looks like it was made in a day using Tkinter. There's no reason for Git not to include a clean, user-friendly graphical interface as part of its default package. I am also aware there are third-party programs like GitKraken that provide a intuitive user-interface. However, the average person is likely deterred before even considering searching for a third-party solution.

To me, Git has always had a strange aura of gate-keeping around it, where it seems intentionally kept needlessly complicated. While it's not difficult to use once you get the hang of it, the initial complexity is kept in to make those who use it feel smarter than the average computer user. 

It's a true shame that Git is not widely accepted as the defacto version control software. Instead, software for non-programmers often have their own built-in VCS. Imagine if Microsoft Office had built in Git support like Visual Studio does? You could create a repository for a class and manage versions for notes, assignments, projects, etc from Word or Powerpoint.

If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read my mini-rant. I'm sure you're all ready to tell me how Git is actually intuitive and I'm just a slow learner in the comments lol.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Git is extremely useful tool for any type of project but its needless complexity makes it scary for people unfamiliar with software development to learn and use.

I can't find a reason why companies choose to artificially limit their stock with products that people can, and will buy.   
Be it the NES/SNES mini, physical collectors' editions for games, art books, dakimakura covers, or literally anything else. There is no reason to not simply offer those items  on-demand after the campaign is over, and if they have a high production cost, the company can just up the price to the point it becomes profitable to sell them, it's not like that's gonna stop the people who really want it.  
I also have a similar opinion on products that are no longer manufactured like old consoles, phones, televisions etc., but that's besides the point of this post.

Now we get to digital limited editions/pre-order exclusive content...  
This is just plain idiocy. It's not like they can simply add said things as DLC, no. They need to sell to you the ""exclusivity"" of having a couple extra lines of code in the game you bought. Or, just having a couple of PNGs that apparently constitute as an ""Art book"".  
There is no way to limit digital content, people are going to either leak it (in the case of things that are standalone), or mod it into the software.

Now, for the conclusion, there is one type of artificial scarcity that I don't have as much of a problem with, and that's backer exclusive physical goods.  
This is because the people who get said products actually helped the project that they backed come into fruition. It is the way that the people who received crowdfunding thank their supporters, that believed in the project that was proposed. It's the way they can say ""It's thanks to you that we got this far.""

To me, it's a better flow in the evening than, for example, if one of us has to work late, the other cooks dinner and then there's this expectation of ""I did you the favor of cooking, now you can clean up the kitchen"". Maybe it makes sense transactionally, but our relationship isn't meant to feel transactional. Maybe it's just my perception of it that makes it feel that way. For me, I just think it's more about ""finishing something you started"". 

Many times the cooking and cleaning is collaborative, but there's inevitably a leader and support person, for lack of better terms. 

Idk... what do you think? Go all in for the night? Or do you prefer a cook for clean trade? ",unpopularopinion

The sweetness of ketchup tends to overpower other dishes, and fries are no exception. While some may enjoy the classic combination of fries and ketchup, I find that the sweetness of the condiment masks the natural flavors of the fries, diminishing the overall experience for me.Moreover, the intense flavor profile of ketchup tends to dominate dishes like fries or meatloaf, taking away from the enjoyment of the meal. For me, ketchup is best reserved for burgers and bratwurst, where its flavor complements the savory elements of the meat. Outside of these classic pairings, I'll pass on the ketchup and opt for other condiments or enjoy the dish as it is. It's all about personal preference, and for me, ketchup just doesn't work with fries or meatloaf.Change my mind. Give me a recipe that will change my view on ketchup.TLDR; Ketchup only works on burgers and brats. Fries or anything else with ketchup on it sucks. I would like a recipe that will change my mind.

You can get a surprisingly diverse experience as you travel around the country, and so I believe that most people can find something they like about it.

There‚Äôs a good mix of ancient and modern - interesting history is found on almost every corner spanning thousands of years that we can learn a lot of lessons from. But there‚Äôs also great nightlife, shopping, entertainment, developed infrastructure, etc.

The countryside is beautiful - lush green and tranquil. The number of walking/hiking trails is pretty remarkable and easily accessible, and there‚Äôs also an extensive rugged coastline to explore.

1595,1708638991.0,Blended foot is better and more convenient than unblended food.,"Recently, I had the unfortunate experience of losing all my teeth, which required me to blend all my food and drink it through one of those large bubble tea straws. I won't get into how I lost my teeth because it's embarassing and not the point of this discussion, so don't ask.

But anyways, at first it was gross but now that I'm used to it, I think it is superior than the normal method of consumption. It's less messy, you don't need utensils, and it's way easier and portable and it just tastes better. I no longer have to waste time eating breakfast, I can just blend it up and drink it along with my coffee on the way to work. Same for lunch and dinner. I don't need to carry a lunchbox, just a cup. I feel like it's easier to digest and I no longer have to deal with constipiasion, although I do admit that this diet does give me the squirts. That's the only downside. Still, the body does not need to waste energy breaking down the food, since it's already been broken down, therefore I have excess energy for other things like brainpower and muscle building. I'm not a sciencetist or anything, but just think about it, the logic makes sense, right? Anyways, I digress.  In summary, blended food is:

* more convinient
* easier to digest
* tastes better once you get used to the texture
* makes it easier to eat healthy foods you don't like, like brocolli and eggplant
* can mix with sodas and coffee, or gatorade if you're exercising and need energy
* is better overall

1598,1708614792.0,There's too much singing on modern mainstream animation.,"In general, there's nothing wrong with a musical animated show/movie. Some of my favorite shows like Bob's Burgers, the Simpsons, and Morel Oral have musical episodes, or devote time specifically for the characters to sing. It can be fun, especially if the voice actors can sing.  
  
That being said, there really should be less of it. There should be more adult animated shows that don't do songs every episode. Animated kid's shows/movies don't have to end in a dance party or sing to progress the plot. It seems like a factory standard to do it that way. (Especially in the West.)  
  
The Into the Spiderverse series is a great example of using music to enhance the experience. Miles singing along with the first song then not again for the rest of the movie was fun! It was a hint of his character, and we still got to experience the music! It's just one example, but there could be more that's done to keep music in without adding singing. 

It kind of seeps into indy animation as well. It's as though you can't have anything mainstream (or for general audiences) without it having the musical type progression.

He is in there to capture rebel leaders, to fight Obi Wan Kenobi, etc. He could very simply have sent a bunch of grunts, but instead he is in the action.
* He is humble and does not tolerate arrogance and bullshit. When everyone is bragging how badass the Death Star is, he brings everyone down to earth and remembers how it is insignificant in the grand scheme of things. And he was right.
* He is resourceful. He doesn't care about hiring bounty hunters, which the empire leadership considers ""scum"". He does what needs to be done to get the job done, and in that case, the job got done.
* He does not tolerate incompetence among people who were put in a leadership position. When he chokes the generals to death, it is not because of pure villainy. It is because his general's bad decisions put unnecessary risk to empire , like alerting the rebels the Empire is coming to Hoth (which required a ground assault, costing men's lives).
* He also takes the time to go personally to the guy who is building the new Death Star to warn him ""our boss is pissed,  you'd better go back to schedule"". He is a bro trying to help his buddy before it is too late.
* On the other hand he promotes individuals who are smart. Like the dude who read a strange signal from the probe droid which might have indicated the rebel base was in Hoth.

1601,1708898838.0,"There is nothing wrong with subscription services, just the people who are choosing to buy them.","There is nothing wrong with subscription services. The issue is usually when people are grabbing all of them and never canceling.

A bit of background: I am subscribed to Amazon Prime, Costco, Max, and a local gym.

Subscription serves have been around for a long time, and no one used to complain. They just need to be worth their value to be worth it. For example, Costco has basically been a subscription service for decades. Yet you get your value in your subscription by the money you save by buying in bulk and all the sales. Another example of a good subscription service that has been around for a long time is Amazon Prime. If you are using Amazon frequently then it is worth it to have Prime for the quicker shipping.

The problem most people run into is when they are subscribing to services and not really using them. Which any person who is a normal adult can manage their money going in and out. 

When it comes to the streaming services, I much like this model over cable. I can pick and choose which streaming service I want to watch things from while not being subscribed to anything else. Right now I am working through Max content, and when I am ready for Disney+ I will pick that up for a few months and then cancel it.

Most people say Tobey's Spiderman is the best live action Spiderman, and Spectacular is the best cartoon Spiderman, but I come here to digress. Ultimate Spiderman from the disney show is far better than any other version of spiderman i've ever seen. I know this is a really bold take, but this is the correct subreddit for this I think.

Most people really dislike the Ultimate Spiderman show, but I love it. The jokes are all awesome I don't think a single one of them is particularly bad, most are funny. The overall plot gets better throughout the seasons, and I love the Spiderverse episodes and Ultimate Goblin. I think the finale was perfect for the show also.

Overall, when I see Spiderman, this is the kind of spidey I want to see. Funny, making jokes mid battle, breaking the 4th wall. Serious at times when the plot demands it. Tobey doesn't make good jokes and Spectacular isn't on the level of Ultimate.

Tom Holland's Spiderman had a lot of potential but unfortunately they were held back by the other Spiderman movie series(Sam Raimi's and TASM) so they couldn't do something like a Spiderman: The Sinister Six movie which is what I wanted instead of No Way Home

IMO the 2nd best Spiderman is probably Insomniac's from the Marvel's Spiderman games, but that might be because they actually *did* get to do the Sinister Six thing, and it's hard for me to rate only the character forgetting that part. Oh also, Ultimate Spiderman also has several episodes where the Sinister Six come together, and also has in my opinion the best version of Carnage so far. I also love some of the side characters like Nova, Power Man and Agent Venom(Flash Thompson in this show).

I understand why some people may disagree, as they've grown up with more serious versions of the character, but I prefer light hearted spidey 90% of the time, and the other 10%, the same spidey but serious, like in the part where Ben Reilly(Scarlet Spider) reveals Peter's identity to Doc Ock

Shows like MLP, Kiff, and Bluey look bad to me, not just due to the lazy reused designs(in the case of MLP and Bluey), but because the colors used in these shows look too bright and/or overly saturated. The more muted colors from cel-animated stuff and a lot of digitally animated stuff from the 2000s(FOP S1, Ren and Stimpy, Danny Phantom, Animaniacs) look a lot nicer than most cartoons nowadays. Mind you, there are stuff I like the color palettes for that came out in recent years. Lupin the 3rd Part IV looks nice color-wise, and I enjoy the recent Dragon Ball stuff from Shintani recently(ex. Super: Broly), and that upcoming Ren and Stimpy reboot seems to be using colors closer to the original run(even if I wish the character animation was more expressive).

I think some people simply love movies or series loaded with symbolism and forget that symbolism isn't **that** important.  
  
  
For example, while watching Breaking Bad and noticing the Color Theory was fun, at the end of the day, it's just a detail. The show was good because of the characters, the plot, and the execution.

And then there are some movies and series that seem to ignore that besides this symbolism, you need a structure that doesn't depend on it to remain solid.

1654,1708814648.0,Git is needlessly complicated,"Git is an extremely useful tool to use when working on any kind of project but for the last 19 years it's been used almost exclusively by software developers. Git is not inherently limited to software projects and can be used as version control for really anything that involves storing files on a computer. Version control software, such as Git, should be as commonly understood by everyday computer users as internet browsers and antivirus software. Git's learning curve is unnecessary and is the main reason why it is not used by everyone. 

Take the command line for example, open up an internet browser and search ""git tutorial"" or ""how to get started with git"". Every tutorial starts by explaining how to use Git's command line interface. I understand that entering commands into a terminal is not technically ""coding"", but to the average person, it looks effectively the same. It's a significant entry barrier that discourages people unfamiliar with the concept to put in the effort to learn it. No other software commonly used by non-software developers requires the user to use the command line for every task. Imagine having to type `word save report.docx` in a terminal window every time you wanted to save in Microsoft Word, or `google revert` to go back a page in Google Chrome. I cannot understand why it is still the default way to interact with Git when it could easily be made to be more user friendly. 

For example, I often use the program ""7-zip"" to compress and decompress files. 7-zip has a command line interface. If I wanted to I could type `7z a` [`file.zip`](https://file.zip) `file.txt` in a terminal window to compress file.txt. However, this is not the default method and does not show up on the first page of a google search. Instead, I can right-click on file.txt in my file explorer, scroll down to 7-Zip in the pop-up menu, and select ""7-Zip > Add to [file.zip](https://file.zip)"". Alternatively, I could use the user-interface that comes pre-installed with 7-zip and compress it from there. Both methods are intuitive and do not require any typing. I don't understand why it's not possible to commit by right-clicking on a Git repository open in file explorer and selecting ""Git > Commit"" in the pop-up menu, or to add a file to the git index by selecting ""Git > Add"". 

I am aware that Git comes pre-installed with Git GUI on Windows, but it looks like it was made in a day using Tkinter. There's no reason for Git not to include a clean, user-friendly graphical interface as part of its default package. I am also aware there are third-party programs like GitKraken that provide a intuitive user-interface. However, the average person is likely deterred before even considering searching for a third-party solution.

To me, Git has always had a strange aura of gate-keeping around it, where it seems intentionally kept needlessly complicated. While it's not difficult to use once you get the hang of it, the initial complexity is kept in to make those who use it feel smarter than the average computer user. 

It's a true shame that Git is not widely accepted as the defacto version control software. Instead, software for non-programmers often have their own built-in VCS. Imagine if Microsoft Office had built in Git support like Visual Studio does? You could create a repository for a class and manage versions for notes, assignments, projects, etc from Word or Powerpoint.

If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read my mini-rant. I'm sure you're all ready to tell me how Git is actually intuitive and I'm just a slow learner in the comments lol.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Git is extremely useful tool for any type of project but its needless complexity makes it scary for people unfamiliar with software development to learn and use.

1671,1708731087.0,Mario & Luigi Partners In Time is the best game in the Mario & Luigi RPG series,Mario & Luigi Partners InTime is the best game in the Mario & Luigi RPG series because of the uniquenees of the story. The story is darker than the other games in the Mario & Luigi games. It's also charming with the babies in it. The babies in the game makes the game a lot cuter. Gameplay is unique because you control 4 characters instead of two. You control both the adult and baby versions of Mario & Luigi. It makes the game a bit more challenging. You have to memorize what button controls which character. My opinion is unpopular because it sold less than the other Mario & Luigi games. The game is under appreciated. I wish the Mario fandom would apperciate the game more. The game deserved a remake for the 3DS. Mario & Luigi Parthers In Time is the perfect sequal to Superstar Saga.,unpopularopinion

I couldnt disagree more. I think that what we need more of is people identifying more with the masks they choose for themselves, rather than dipping into their inner world all the time. And I mean specifically how that mask allows them to act in the real world in every facet of their lives.

As an example if someone is a timid and ineffective wimp, what would looking inward do? They'd simply find the ineffectual wimp. If that same wimp decides ""wait I dont want to be this version of me, I want to be this other version"" then in a way they're more like donning a mask and embodying it. This isnt to say theres no examples of how something positive within you can be represses, but often from what I've seen focusing on our inner world rather than our actions in the real world is more like a form of mental masturbation than positive growth.

1673,1708736636.0,Limited editions/first print editions make no sense economically.,"I get it, having something that you can't get anymore is cool, but that's it...

I can't find a reason why companies choose to artificially limit their stock with products that people can, and will buy.   
Be it the NES/SNES mini, physical collectors' editions for games, art books, dakimakura covers, or literally anything else. There is no reason to not simply offer those items  on-demand after the campaign is over, and if they have a high production cost, the company can just up the price to the point it becomes profitable to sell them, it's not like that's gonna stop the people who really want it.  
I also have a similar opinion on products that are no longer manufactured like old consoles, phones, televisions etc., but that's besides the point of this post.

Now we get to digital limited editions/pre-order exclusive content...  
This is just plain idiocy. It's not like they can simply add said things as DLC, no. They need to sell to you the ""exclusivity"" of having a couple extra lines of code in the game you bought. Or, just having a couple of PNGs that apparently constitute as an ""Art book"".  
There is no way to limit digital content, people are going to either leak it (in the case of things that are standalone), or mod it into the software.

Now, for the conclusion, there is one type of artificial scarcity that I don't have as much of a problem with, and that's backer exclusive physical goods.  
This is because the people who get said products actually helped the project that they backed come into fruition. It is the way that the people who received crowdfunding thank their supporters, that believed in the project that was proposed. It's the way they can say ""It's thanks to you that we got this far.""  
Of course the scarcity is still purely artificial, and anyone with the design documents and contacts in manufacturing can still make them, but it's more about the connection between the backer and the product than the goods themselves.",unpopularopinion

Maybe it makes sense transactionally, but our relationship isn't meant to feel transactional. Maybe it's just my perception of it that makes it feel that way.

But anyways, at first it was gross but now that I'm used to it, I think it is superior than the normal method of consumption. It's less messy, you don't need utensils, and it's way easier and portable and it just tastes better. I no longer have to waste time eating breakfast, I can just blend it up and drink it along with my coffee on the way to work. Same for lunch and dinner. I don't need to carry a lunchbox, just a cup. I feel like it's easier to digest and I no longer have to deal with constipiasion, although I do admit that this diet does give me the squirts. That's the only downside.

It can be fun, especially if the voice actors can sing.  
  
That being said, there really should be less of it. There should be more adult animated shows that don't do songs every episode. Animated kid's shows/movies don't have to end in a dance party or sing to progress the plot. It seems like a factory standard to do it that way. (Especially in the West.)  
  
The Into the Spiderverse series is a great example of using music to enhance the experience. Miles singing along with the first song then not again for the rest of the movie was fun!

* He does not tolerate incompetence among people who were put in a leadership position. When he chokes the generals to death, it is not because of pure villainy. It is because his general's bad decisions put unnecessary risk to empire , like alerting the rebels the Empire is coming to Hoth (which required a ground assault, costing men's lives).
* He also takes the time to go personally to the guy who is building the new Death Star to warn him ""our boss is pissed,  you'd better go back to schedule"". He is a bro trying to help his buddy before it is too late.

A bit of background: I am subscribed to Amazon Prime, Costco, Max, and a local gym.

Subscription serves have been around for a long time, and no one used to complain. They just need to be worth their value to be worth it. For example, Costco has basically been a subscription service for decades. Yet you get your value in your subscription by the money you save by buying in bulk and all the sales. Another example of a good subscription service that has been around for a long time is Amazon Prime. If you are using Amazon frequently then it is worth it to have Prime for the quicker shipping.

The problem most people run into is when they are subscribing to services and not really using them. Which any person who is a normal adult can manage their money going in and out. 

When it comes to the streaming services, I much like this model over cable. I can pick and choose which streaming service I want to watch things from while not being subscribed to anything else.

Most people say Tobey's Spiderman is the best live action Spiderman, and Spectacular is the best cartoon Spiderman, but I come here to digress. Ultimate Spiderman from the disney show is far better than any other version of spiderman i've ever seen. I know this is a really bold take, but this is the correct subreddit for this I think.

Most people really dislike the Ultimate Spiderman show, but I love it. The jokes are all awesome I don't think a single one of them is particularly bad, most are funny. The overall plot gets better throughout the seasons, and I love the Spiderverse episodes and Ultimate Goblin. I think the finale was perfect for the show also.

Overall, when I see Spiderman, this is the kind of spidey I want to see. Funny, making jokes mid battle, breaking the 4th wall. Serious at times when the plot demands it. Tobey doesn't make good jokes and Spectacular isn't on the level of Ultimate.

Tom Holland's Spiderman had a lot of potential but unfortunately they were held back by the other Spiderman movie series(Sam Raimi's and TASM) so they couldn't do something like a Spiderman: The Sinister Six movie which is what I wanted instead of No Way Home

IMO the 2nd best Spiderman is probably Insomniac's from the Marvel's Spiderman games, but that might be because they actually *did* get to do the Sinister Six thing, and it's hard for me to rate only the character forgetting that part. Oh also, Ultimate Spiderman also has several episodes where the Sinister Six come together, and also has in my opinion the best version of Carnage so far. I also love some of the side characters like Nova, Power Man and Agent Venom(Flash Thompson in this show).

I understand why some people may disagree, as they've grown up with more serious versions of the character, but I prefer light hearted spidey 90% of the time, and the other 10%, the same spidey but serious, like in the part where Ben Reilly(Scarlet Spider) reveals Peter's identity to Doc Ock

1705,1708898110.0,Michael Jackson was most likely innocent,"Unsurprisingly a lot of people seem to have strong opinions about this issue. I've watched many documentaries from both sides and it seems to me none of the accusations hold much water.   
Michael Jackson didn't pay Jordan Chandler anything, his insurance company did. It was their choice, not Michael's. The settlement didn't prevent Jordan from testifying in criminal court, he just simply refused to. Jordan's own mother seems to think MJ was innocent and according to rumors Jordan himself has said his dad made him lie about those things and it was all for the money. The Leaving Neverland -documentary is filled with nonsense, like for example they claim he somehow committed crimes in Paris disneyland and Neverland train station years before they were even built.   
I don't claim to know what really happened, but the evidence doesn't seem strong enough to prove guilt. Which is probably the reason he was found innocent in the big court case.",unpopularopinion

1754,1708814648.0,Git is needlessly complicated,"Git is an extremely useful tool to use when working on any kind of project but for the last 19 years it's been used almost exclusively by software developers. Git is not inherently limited to software projects and can be used as version control for really anything that involves storing files on a computer. Version control software, such as Git, should be as commonly understood by everyday computer users as internet browsers and antivirus software. Git's learning curve is unnecessary and is the main reason why it is not used by everyone. 

Take the command line for example, open up an internet browser and search ""git tutorial"" or ""how to get started with git"". Every tutorial starts by explaining how to use Git's command line interface. I understand that entering commands into a terminal is not technically ""coding"", but to the average person, it looks effectively the same. It's a significant entry barrier that discourages people unfamiliar with the concept to put in the effort to learn it. No other software commonly used by non-software developers requires the user to use the command line for every task. Imagine having to type `word save report.docx` in a terminal window every time you wanted to save in Microsoft Word, or `google revert` to go back a page in Google Chrome. I cannot understand why it is still the default way to interact with Git when it could easily be made to be more user friendly. 

For example, I often use the program ""7-zip"" to compress and decompress files. 7-zip has a command line interface. If I wanted to I could type `7z a` [`file.zip`](https://file.zip) `file.txt` in a terminal window to compress file.txt. However, this is not the default method and does not show up on the first page of a google search. Instead, I can right-click on file.txt in my file explorer, scroll down to 7-Zip in the pop-up menu, and select ""7-Zip > Add to [file.zip](https://file.zip)"". Alternatively, I could use the user-interface that comes pre-installed with 7-zip and compress it from there. Both methods are intuitive and do not require any typing. I don't understand why it's not possible to commit by right-clicking on a Git repository open in file explorer and selecting ""Git > Commit"" in the pop-up menu, or to add a file to the git index by selecting ""Git > Add"". 

I am aware that Git comes pre-installed with Git GUI on Windows, but it looks like it was made in a day using Tkinter. There's no reason for Git not to include a clean, user-friendly graphical interface as part of its default package. I am also aware there are third-party programs like GitKraken that provide a intuitive user-interface. However, the average person is likely deterred before even considering searching for a third-party solution.

To me, Git has always had a strange aura of gate-keeping around it, where it seems intentionally kept needlessly complicated. While it's not difficult to use once you get the hang of it, the initial complexity is kept in to make those who use it feel smarter than the average computer user. 

It's a true shame that Git is not widely accepted as the defacto version control software. Instead, software for non-programmers often have their own built-in VCS. Imagine if Microsoft Office had built in Git support like Visual Studio does? You could create a repository for a class and manage versions for notes, assignments, projects, etc from Word or Powerpoint.

If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read my mini-rant. I'm sure you're all ready to tell me how Git is actually intuitive and I'm just a slow learner in the comments lol.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Git is extremely useful tool for any type of project but its needless complexity makes it scary for people unfamiliar with software development to learn and use.

As an example if someone is a timid and ineffective wimp, what would looking inward do? They'd simply find the ineffectual wimp.

1773,1708736636.0,Limited editions/first print editions make no sense economically.,"I get it, having something that you can't get anymore is cool, but that's it...

I can't find a reason why companies choose to artificially limit their stock with products that people can, and will buy.   
Be it the NES/SNES mini, physical collectors' editions for games, art books, dakimakura covers, or literally anything else. There is no reason to not simply offer those items  on-demand after the campaign is over, and if they have a high production cost, the company can just up the price to the point it becomes profitable to sell them, it's not like that's gonna stop the people who really want it.  
I also have a similar opinion on products that are no longer manufactured like old consoles, phones, televisions etc., but that's besides the point of this post.

Now we get to digital limited editions/pre-order exclusive content...  
This is just plain idiocy. It's not like they can simply add said things as DLC, no. They need to sell to you the ""exclusivity"" of having a couple extra lines of code in the game you bought. Or, just having a couple of PNGs that apparently constitute as an ""Art book"".  
There is no way to limit digital content, people are going to either leak it (in the case of things that are standalone), or mod it into the software.

Now, for the conclusion, there is one type of artificial scarcity that I don't have as much of a problem with, and that's backer exclusive physical goods.  
This is because the people who get said products actually helped the project that they backed come into fruition. It is the way that the people who received crowdfunding thank their supporters, that believed in the project that was proposed. It's the way they can say ""It's thanks to you that we got this far.""  
Of course the scarcity is still purely artificial, and anyone with the design documents and contacts in manufacturing can still make them, but it's more about the connection between the backer and the product than the goods themselves.",unpopularopinion

To me, it's a better flow in the evening than, for example, if one of us has to work late, the other cooks dinner and then there's this expectation of ""I did you the favor of cooking, now you can clean up the kitchen"". Maybe it makes sense transactionally, but our relationship isn't meant to feel transactional. Maybe it's just my perception of it that makes it feel that way.

I'm not a sciencetist or anything, but just think about it, the logic makes sense, right? Anyways, I digress.  In summary, blended food is:

* more convinient
* easier to digest
* tastes better once you get used to the texture
* makes it easier to eat healthy foods you don't like, like brocolli and eggplant
* can mix with sodas and coffee, or gatorade if you're exercising and need energy
* is better overall

1798,1708614792.0,There's too much singing on modern mainstream animation.,"In general, there's nothing wrong with a musical animated show/movie. Some of my favorite shows like Bob's Burgers, the Simpsons, and Morel Oral have musical episodes, or devote time specifically for the characters to sing. It can be fun, especially if the voice actors can sing.  
  
That being said, there really should be less of it. There should be more adult animated shows that don't do songs every episode. Animated kid's shows/movies don't have to end in a dance party or sing to progress the plot. It seems like a factory standard to do it that way. (Especially in the West.)  
  
The Into the Spiderverse series is a great example of using music to enhance the experience. Miles singing along with the first song then not again for the rest of the movie was fun! It was a hint of his character, and we still got to experience the music! It's just one example, but there could be more that's done to keep music in without adding singing. 

It kind of seeps into indy animation as well. It's as though you can't have anything mainstream (or for general audiences) without it having the musical type progression.

1799,1708582899.0,Darth Vader is an exemplary leader,"Everyone thinks of Darth Vader as the ruthless bad guy who kills everyone who opposes him. But he actually shows very strong leadership traits:

* While he is the most powerful individual in the Galactic Empire after the emperor, he does not lead from an ivory tower. He gets his hand dirty. A rebel fleet is attacking the Death Star? Not only he is in a fighter with his fellow pilots, he actually shoots down most of the enemy ships himself. He is in there to capture rebel leaders, to fight Obi Wan Kenobi, etc. He could very simply have sent a bunch of grunts, but instead he is in the action.
* He is humble and does not tolerate arrogance and bullshit. When everyone is bragging how badass the Death Star is, he brings everyone down to earth and remembers how it is insignificant in the grand scheme of things. And he was right.
* He is resourceful. He doesn't care about hiring bounty hunters, which the empire leadership considers ""scum"". He does what needs to be done to get the job done, and in that case, the job got done.
* He does not tolerate incompetence among people who were put in a leadership position. When he chokes the generals to death, it is not because of pure villainy. It is because his general's bad decisions put unnecessary risk to empire , like alerting the rebels the Empire is coming to Hoth (which required a ground assault, costing men's lives).
* He also takes the time to go personally to the guy who is building the new Death Star to warn him ""our boss is pissed,  you'd better go back to schedule"". He is a bro trying to help his buddy before it is too late.
* On the other hand he promotes individuals who are smart. Like the dude who read a strange signal from the probe droid which might have indicated the rebel base was in Hoth.

1801,1708898838.0,"There is nothing wrong with subscription services, just the people who are choosing to buy them.","There is nothing wrong with subscription services. The issue is usually when people are grabbing all of them and never canceling.

A bit of background: I am subscribed to Amazon Prime, Costco, Max, and a local gym.

Subscription serves have been around for a long time, and no one used to complain. They just need to be worth their value to be worth it. For example, Costco has basically been a subscription service for decades. Yet you get your value in your subscription by the money you save by buying in bulk and all the sales. Another example of a good subscription service that has been around for a long time is Amazon Prime. If you are using Amazon frequently then it is worth it to have Prime for the quicker shipping.

The problem most people run into is when they are subscribing to services and not really using them. Which any person who is a normal adult can manage their money going in and out. 

When it comes to the streaming services, I much like this model over cable. I can pick and choose which streaming service I want to watch things from while not being subscribed to anything else. Right now I am working through Max content, and when I am ready for Disney+ I will pick that up for a few months and then cancel it. I dropped Netflix last year and will likely not pick it up again for another few years at this rate.

1803,1708898349.0,Ultimate Spiderman is the best spiderman,"Post is flagged with ""Spoiler"" because I kind of spoil the show ""Ultimate Spiderman"" a little bit on the post, so be aware of that

Most people say Tobey's Spiderman is the best live action Spiderman, and Spectacular is the best cartoon Spiderman, but I come here to digress. Ultimate Spiderman from the disney show is far better than any other version of spiderman i've ever seen. I know this is a really bold take, but this is the correct subreddit for this I think.

Most people really dislike the Ultimate Spiderman show, but I love it. The jokes are all awesome I don't think a single one of them is particularly bad, most are funny. The overall plot gets better throughout the seasons, and I love the Spiderverse episodes and Ultimate Goblin. I think the finale was perfect for the show also.

Overall, when I see Spiderman, this is the kind of spidey I want to see. Funny, making jokes mid battle, breaking the 4th wall. Serious at times when the plot demands it. Tobey doesn't make good jokes and Spectacular isn't on the level of Ultimate.

Tom Holland's Spiderman had a lot of potential but unfortunately they were held back by the other Spiderman movie series(Sam Raimi's and TASM) so they couldn't do something like a Spiderman: The Sinister Six movie which is what I wanted instead of No Way Home

IMO the 2nd best Spiderman is probably Insomniac's from the Marvel's Spiderman games, but that might be because they actually *did* get to do the Sinister Six thing, and it's hard for me to rate only the character forgetting that part. Oh also, Ultimate Spiderman also has several episodes where the Sinister Six come together, and also has in my opinion the best version of Carnage so far. I also love some of the side characters like Nova, Power Man and Agent Venom(Flash Thompson in this show).

I understand why some people may disagree, as they've grown up with more serious versions of the character, but I prefer light hearted spidey 90% of the time, and the other 10%, the same spidey but serious, like in the part where Ben Reilly(Scarlet Spider) reveals Peter's identity to Doc Ock

Michael Jackson didn't pay Jordan Chandler anything, his insurance company did. It was their choice, not Michael's.

Pastel colors are too cutesy(and have been ruined for me by a lot of internet artists who are bad people), and neon colors are too bright for me and are hard to look at. Shows like MLP, Kiff, and Bluey look bad to me, not just due to the lazy reused designs(in the case of MLP and Bluey), but because the colors used in these shows look too bright and/or overly saturated. The more muted colors from cel-animated stuff and a lot of digitally animated stuff from the 2000s(FOP S1, Ren and Stimpy, Danny Phantom, Animaniacs) look a lot nicer than most cartoons nowadays. Mind you, there are stuff I like the color palettes for that came out in recent years. Lupin the 3rd Part IV looks nice color-wise, and I enjoy the recent Dragon Ball stuff from Shintani recently(ex. Super: Broly), and that upcoming Ren and Stimpy reboot seems to be using colors closer to the original run(even if I wish the character animation was more expressive). The new SpongeBob seasons are well-animated, but they should go back to the S1 colors. Hell, I'd take S2/3 or the 1st movie colors over what we have. It's all my personal opinion, but yeah.

And then there are some movies and series that seem to ignore that besides this symbolism, you need a structure that doesn't depend on it to remain solid.

1854,1708814648.0,Git is needlessly complicated,"Git is an extremely useful tool to use when working on any kind of project but for the last 19 years it's been used almost exclusively by software developers. Git is not inherently limited to software projects and can be used as version control for really anything that involves storing files on a computer. Version control software, such as Git, should be as commonly understood by everyday computer users as internet browsers and antivirus software. Git's learning curve is unnecessary and is the main reason why it is not used by everyone. 

Take the command line for example, open up an internet browser and search ""git tutorial"" or ""how to get started with git"". Every tutorial starts by explaining how to use Git's command line interface. I understand that entering commands into a terminal is not technically ""coding"", but to the average person, it looks effectively the same. It's a significant entry barrier that discourages people unfamiliar with the concept to put in the effort to learn it. No other software commonly used by non-software developers requires the user to use the command line for every task. Imagine having to type `word save report.docx` in a terminal window every time you wanted to save in Microsoft Word, or `google revert` to go back a page in Google Chrome. I cannot understand why it is still the default way to interact with Git when it could easily be made to be more user friendly. 

For example, I often use the program ""7-zip"" to compress and decompress files. 7-zip has a command line interface. If I wanted to I could type `7z a` [`file.zip`](https://file.zip) `file.txt` in a terminal window to compress file.txt. However, this is not the default method and does not show up on the first page of a google search. Instead, I can right-click on file.txt in my file explorer, scroll down to 7-Zip in the pop-up menu, and select ""7-Zip > Add to [file.zip](https://file.zip)"". Alternatively, I could use the user-interface that comes pre-installed with 7-zip and compress it from there. Both methods are intuitive and do not require any typing. I don't understand why it's not possible to commit by right-clicking on a Git repository open in file explorer and selecting ""Git > Commit"" in the pop-up menu, or to add a file to the git index by selecting ""Git > Add"". 

I am aware that Git comes pre-installed with Git GUI on Windows, but it looks like it was made in a day using Tkinter. There's no reason for Git not to include a clean, user-friendly graphical interface as part of its default package. I am also aware there are third-party programs like GitKraken that provide a intuitive user-interface. However, the average person is likely deterred before even considering searching for a third-party solution.

To me, Git has always had a strange aura of gate-keeping around it, where it seems intentionally kept needlessly complicated. While it's not difficult to use once you get the hang of it, the initial complexity is kept in to make those who use it feel smarter than the average computer user. 

It's a true shame that Git is not widely accepted as the defacto version control software. Instead, software for non-programmers often have their own built-in VCS. Imagine if Microsoft Office had built in Git support like Visual Studio does? You could create a repository for a class and manage versions for notes, assignments, projects, etc from Word or Powerpoint.

If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read my mini-rant. I'm sure you're all ready to tell me how Git is actually intuitive and I'm just a slow learner in the comments lol.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Git is extremely useful tool for any type of project but its needless complexity makes it scary for people unfamiliar with software development to learn and use.

I can't find a reason why companies choose to artificially limit their stock with products that people can, and will buy.   
Be it the NES/SNES mini, physical collectors' editions for games, art books, dakimakura covers, or literally anything else. There is no reason to not simply offer those items  on-demand after the campaign is over, and if they have a high production cost, the company can just up the price to the point it becomes profitable to sell them, it's not like that's gonna stop the people who really want it.  
I also have a similar opinion on products that are no longer manufactured like old consoles, phones, televisions etc., but that's besides the point of this post.

Now we get to digital limited editions/pre-order exclusive content...  
This is just plain idiocy. It's not like they can simply add said things as DLC, no. They need to sell to you the ""exclusivity"" of having a couple extra lines of code in the game you bought. Or, just having a couple of PNGs that apparently constitute as an ""Art book"".  
There is no way to limit digital content, people are going to either leak it (in the case of things that are standalone), or mod it into the software.

Now, for the conclusion, there is one type of artificial scarcity that I don't have as much of a problem with, and that's backer exclusive physical goods.  
This is because the people who get said products actually helped the project that they backed come into fruition. It is the way that the people who received crowdfunding thank their supporters, that believed in the project that was proposed. It's the way they can say ""It's thanks to you that we got this far.""

1885,1708702177.0,Ketchup is only good on brats and burgers.,"When it comes to ketchup, I've found that it just doesn't align with my taste buds unless it's paired with burgers or bratwurst. The sweetness of ketchup tends to overpower other dishes, and fries are no exception. While some may enjoy the classic combination of fries and ketchup, I find that the sweetness of the condiment masks the natural flavors of the fries, diminishing the overall experience for me.Moreover, the intense flavor profile of ketchup tends to dominate dishes like fries or meatloaf, taking away from the enjoyment of the meal. For me, ketchup is best reserved for burgers and bratwurst, where its flavor complements the savory elements of the meat. Outside of these classic pairings, I'll pass on the ketchup and opt for other condiments or enjoy the dish as it is. It's all about personal preference, and for me, ketchup just doesn't work with fries or meatloaf.Change my mind. Give me a recipe that will change my view on ketchup.TLDR; Ketchup only works on burgers and brats. Fries or anything else with ketchup on it sucks. I would like a recipe that will change my mind.

Edit: I only put ketchup on grocery store brats. If they're from a meat market then I don't. It ruins the flavor.

They look down on people who get told what to do and aren't their own boss.  They're out there living the dream in their own mind looking down on employees.

Ironically, they're their own boss but are being told what to do by the customer and market demand.  If they truly did what they wanted to do and it didn't align with demand they'd go broke.

We're supposed to priase them for ""taking a risk"" to start their business, that's like praising a gambler for betting all of his money on black at the roulette table.  Or praising a well-off trust fund kid for starting something when there wasn't much risk to begin with.

Not to mention small business owners could easily be criminals.  Why don't they want to work for a company?  A criminal record?

You can get a surprisingly diverse experience as you travel around the country, and so I believe that most people can find something they like about it. 

Countless towns and regions have their own cultural identities, ways of life, dialects/accents, food traditions, architecture, and genetic makeup. There‚Äôs a varied mix of cities and towns- from charming historic to modern planned towns, industrial eyesores, etc. Anything you could possibly want. 

There‚Äôs a good mix of ancient and modern - interesting history is found on almost every corner spanning thousands of years that we can learn a lot of lessons from. But there‚Äôs also great nightlife, shopping, entertainment, developed infrastructure, etc.

The countryside is beautiful - lush green and tranquil. The number of walking/hiking trails is pretty remarkable and easily accessible, and there‚Äôs also an extensive rugged coastline to explore.

1895,1708638991.0,Blended foot is better and more convenient than unblended food.,"Recently, I had the unfortunate experience of losing all my teeth, which required me to blend all my food and drink it through one of those large bubble tea straws. I won't get into how I lost my teeth because it's embarassing and not the point of this discussion, so don't ask.

But anyways, at first it was gross but now that I'm used to it, I think it is superior than the normal method of consumption. It's less messy, you don't need utensils, and it's way easier and portable and it just tastes better. I no longer have to waste time eating breakfast, I can just blend it up and drink it along with my coffee on the way to work. Same for lunch and dinner. I don't need to carry a lunchbox, just a cup. I feel like it's easier to digest and I no longer have to deal with constipiasion, although I do admit that this diet does give me the squirts. That's the only downside. Still, the body does not need to waste energy breaking down the food, since it's already been broken down, therefore I have excess energy for other things like brainpower and muscle building. I'm not a sciencetist or anything, but just think about it, the logic makes sense, right? Anyways, I digress.  In summary, blended food is:

* more convinient
* easier to digest
* tastes better once you get used to the texture
* makes it easier to eat healthy foods you don't like, like brocolli and eggplant
* can mix with sodas and coffee, or gatorade if you're exercising and need energy
* is better overall

1898,1708614792.0,There's too much singing on modern mainstream animation.,"In general, there's nothing wrong with a musical animated show/movie. Some of my favorite shows like Bob's Burgers, the Simpsons, and Morel Oral have musical episodes, or devote time specifically for the characters to sing. It can be fun, especially if the voice actors can sing.  
  
That being said, there really should be less of it. There should be more adult animated shows that don't do songs every episode. Animated kid's shows/movies don't have to end in a dance party or sing to progress the plot. It seems like a factory standard to do it that way. (Especially in the West.)  
  
The Into the Spiderverse series is a great example of using music to enhance the experience. Miles singing along with the first song then not again for the rest of the movie was fun! It was a hint of his character, and we still got to experience the music! It's just one example, but there could be more that's done to keep music in without adding singing. 

It kind of seeps into indy animation as well. It's as though you can't have anything mainstream (or for general audiences) without it having the musical type progression.

Not only he is in a fighter with his fellow pilots, he actually shoots down most of the enemy ships himself. He is in there to capture rebel leaders, to fight Obi Wan Kenobi, etc. He could very simply have sent a bunch of grunts, but instead he is in the action.
* He is humble and does not tolerate arrogance and bullshit. When everyone is bragging how badass the Death Star is, he brings everyone down to earth and remembers how it is insignificant in the grand scheme of things. And he was right.
* He is resourceful. He doesn't care about hiring bounty hunters, which the empire leadership considers ""scum"". He does what needs to be done to get the job done, and in that case, the job got done.
* He does not tolerate incompetence among people who were put in a leadership position. When he chokes the generals to death, it is not because of pure villainy. It is because his general's bad decisions put unnecessary risk to empire , like alerting the rebels the Empire is coming to Hoth (which required a ground assault, costing men's lives).
* He also takes the time to go personally to the guy who is building the new Death Star to warn him ""our boss is pissed,  you'd better go back to schedule"". He is a bro trying to help his buddy before it is too late.
* On the other hand he promotes individuals who are smart. Like the dude who read a strange signal from the probe droid which might have indicated the rebel base was in Hoth.

1901,1708898838.0,"There is nothing wrong with subscription services, just the people who are choosing to buy them.","There is nothing wrong with subscription services. The issue is usually when people are grabbing all of them and never canceling.

A bit of background: I am subscribed to Amazon Prime, Costco, Max, and a local gym.

Subscription serves have been around for a long time, and no one used to complain. They just need to be worth their value to be worth it. For example, Costco has basically been a subscription service for decades. Yet you get your value in your subscription by the money you save by buying in bulk and all the sales. Another example of a good subscription service that has been around for a long time is Amazon Prime. If you are using Amazon frequently then it is worth it to have Prime for the quicker shipping.

The problem most people run into is when they are subscribing to services and not really using them. Which any person who is a normal adult can manage their money going in and out. 

When it comes to the streaming services, I much like this model over cable. I can pick and choose which streaming service I want to watch things from while not being subscribed to anything else. Right now I am working through Max content, and when I am ready for Disney+ I will pick that up for a few months and then cancel it. I dropped Netflix last year and will likely not pick it up again for another few years at this rate.

1903,1708898349.0,Ultimate Spiderman is the best spiderman,"Post is flagged with ""Spoiler"" because I kind of spoil the show ""Ultimate Spiderman"" a little bit on the post, so be aware of that

Most people say Tobey's Spiderman is the best live action Spiderman, and Spectacular is the best cartoon Spiderman, but I come here to digress. Ultimate Spiderman from the disney show is far better than any other version of spiderman i've ever seen. I know this is a really bold take, but this is the correct subreddit for this I think.

Most people really dislike the Ultimate Spiderman show, but I love it. The jokes are all awesome I don't think a single one of them is particularly bad, most are funny. The overall plot gets better throughout the seasons, and I love the Spiderverse episodes and Ultimate Goblin. I think the finale was perfect for the show also.

Overall, when I see Spiderman, this is the kind of spidey I want to see. Funny, making jokes mid battle, breaking the 4th wall. Serious at times when the plot demands it. Tobey doesn't make good jokes and Spectacular isn't on the level of Ultimate.

Tom Holland's Spiderman had a lot of potential but unfortunately they were held back by the other Spiderman movie series(Sam Raimi's and TASM) so they couldn't do something like a Spiderman: The Sinister Six movie which is what I wanted instead of No Way Home

IMO the 2nd best Spiderman is probably Insomniac's from the Marvel's Spiderman games, but that might be because they actually *did* get to do the Sinister Six thing, and it's hard for me to rate only the character forgetting that part. Oh also, Ultimate Spiderman also has several episodes where the Sinister Six come together, and also has in my opinion the best version of Carnage so far. I also love some of the side characters like Nova, Power Man and Agent Venom(Flash Thompson in this show).

I understand why some people may disagree, as they've grown up with more serious versions of the character, but I prefer light hearted spidey 90% of the time, and the other 10%, the same spidey but serious, like in the part where Ben Reilly(Scarlet Spider) reveals Peter's identity to Doc Ock

And then there are some movies and series that seem to ignore that besides this symbolism, you need a structure that doesn't depend on it to remain solid. I can name a few series like that here: Midsommar, Hereditary, Evangelion, Zima Blue (episode from ""Love, Death & Robots""), some episodes of Black Mirror.

1954,1708814648.0,Git is needlessly complicated,"Git is an extremely useful tool to use when working on any kind of project but for the last 19 years it's been used almost exclusively by software developers. Git is not inherently limited to software projects and can be used as version control for really anything that involves storing files on a computer. Version control software, such as Git, should be as commonly understood by everyday computer users as internet browsers and antivirus software. Git's learning curve is unnecessary and is the main reason why it is not used by everyone. 

Take the command line for example, open up an internet browser and search ""git tutorial"" or ""how to get started with git"". Every tutorial starts by explaining how to use Git's command line interface. I understand that entering commands into a terminal is not technically ""coding"", but to the average person, it looks effectively the same. It's a significant entry barrier that discourages people unfamiliar with the concept to put in the effort to learn it. No other software commonly used by non-software developers requires the user to use the command line for every task. Imagine having to type `word save report.docx` in a terminal window every time you wanted to save in Microsoft Word, or `google revert` to go back a page in Google Chrome. I cannot understand why it is still the default way to interact with Git when it could easily be made to be more user friendly. 

For example, I often use the program ""7-zip"" to compress and decompress files. 7-zip has a command line interface. If I wanted to I could type `7z a` [`file.zip`](https://file.zip) `file.txt` in a terminal window to compress file.txt. However, this is not the default method and does not show up on the first page of a google search. Instead, I can right-click on file.txt in my file explorer, scroll down to 7-Zip in the pop-up menu, and select ""7-Zip > Add to [file.zip](https://file.zip)"". Alternatively, I could use the user-interface that comes pre-installed with 7-zip and compress it from there. Both methods are intuitive and do not require any typing. I don't understand why it's not possible to commit by right-clicking on a Git repository open in file explorer and selecting ""Git > Commit"" in the pop-up menu, or to add a file to the git index by selecting ""Git > Add"". 

I am aware that Git comes pre-installed with Git GUI on Windows, but it looks like it was made in a day using Tkinter. There's no reason for Git not to include a clean, user-friendly graphical interface as part of its default package. I am also aware there are third-party programs like GitKraken that provide a intuitive user-interface. However, the average person is likely deterred before even considering searching for a third-party solution.

To me, Git has always had a strange aura of gate-keeping around it, where it seems intentionally kept needlessly complicated. While it's not difficult to use once you get the hang of it, the initial complexity is kept in to make those who use it feel smarter than the average computer user. 

It's a true shame that Git is not widely accepted as the defacto version control software. Instead, software for non-programmers often have their own built-in VCS. Imagine if Microsoft Office had built in Git support like Visual Studio does? You could create a repository for a class and manage versions for notes, assignments, projects, etc from Word or Powerpoint.

If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read my mini-rant. I'm sure you're all ready to tell me how Git is actually intuitive and I'm just a slow learner in the comments lol.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Git is extremely useful tool for any type of project but its needless complexity makes it scary for people unfamiliar with software development to learn and use.

I also have a similar opinion on products that are no longer manufactured like old consoles, phones, televisions etc., but that's besides the point of this post.

There is no way to limit digital content, people are going to either leak it (in the case of things that are standalone), or mod it into the software.

Now, for the conclusion, there is one type of artificial scarcity that I don't have as much of a problem with, and that's backer exclusive physical goods.  
This is because the people who get said products actually helped the project that they backed come into fruition. It is the way that the people who received crowdfunding thank their supporters, that believed in the project that was proposed. It's the way they can say ""It's thanks to you that we got this far.""  
Of course the scarcity is still purely artificial, and anyone with the design documents and contacts in manufacturing can still make them, but it's more about the connection between the backer and the product than the goods themselves.",unpopularopinion

These videos often talk about dying arts and crafts from around the world, talking about how these methods should be preserved and how these methods should continue to be used and safeguarded against the encroachment of modern techniques. I think that it's rather dumb and that if these arts are dying, they should be allowed to die. We've documented these methods, recorded their history, and now, allow them to die to make way for more modern techniques that bring costs down.

My partner and I both cook throughout the week. It is my opinion that on nights when my partner cooks, they should also clean up the kitchen afterward, and vice versa. Personally, on nights when I cook, I am already in a task-focused mode, so I have less issue with cleaning up after we eat together. To me, it's a better flow in the evening than, for example, if one of us has to work late, the other cooks dinner and then there's this expectation of ""I did you the favor of cooking, now you can clean up the kitchen"". Maybe it makes sense transactionally, but our relationship isn't meant to feel transactional. Maybe it's just my perception of it that makes it feel that way. For me, I just think it's more about ""finishing something you started"". 

Many times the cooking and cleaning is collaborative, but there's inevitably a leader and support person, for lack of better terms.

The sweetness of ketchup tends to overpower other dishes, and fries are no exception. While some may enjoy the classic combination of fries and ketchup, I find that the sweetness of the condiment masks the natural flavors of the fries, diminishing the overall experience for me.Moreover, the intense flavor profile of ketchup tends to dominate dishes like fries or meatloaf, taking away from the enjoyment of the meal. For me, ketchup is best reserved for burgers and bratwurst, where its flavor complements the savory elements of the meat. Outside of these classic pairings, I'll pass on the ketchup and opt for other condiments or enjoy the dish as it is. It's all about personal preference, and for me, ketchup just doesn't work with fries or meatloaf.Change my mind. Give me a recipe that will change my view on ketchup.TLDR; Ketchup only works on burgers and brats. Fries or anything else with ketchup on it sucks. I would like a recipe that will change my mind.

They look down on people who get told what to do and aren't their own boss.  They're out there living the dream in their own mind looking down on employees.

Ironically, they're their own boss but are being told what to do by the customer and market demand.  If they truly did what they wanted to do and it didn't align with demand they'd go broke.

We're supposed to priase them for ""taking a risk"" to start their business, that's like praising a gambler for betting all of his money on black at the roulette table.  Or praising a well-off trust fund kid for starting something when there wasn't much risk to begin with.

Not to mention small business owners could easily be criminals.  Why don't they want to work for a company?  A criminal record?

Another example: skateshops.  People say buy from your local skateshop, but sometimes the owners of those shops are elitist pricks who look down on beginners.

You can get a surprisingly diverse experience as you travel around the country, and so I believe that most people can find something they like about it. 

Countless towns and regions have their own cultural identities, ways of life, dialects/accents, food traditions, architecture, and genetic makeup. There‚Äôs a varied mix of cities and towns- from charming historic to modern planned towns, industrial eyesores, etc. Anything you could possibly want. 

There‚Äôs a good mix of ancient and modern - interesting history is found on almost every corner spanning thousands of years that we can learn a lot of lessons from. But there‚Äôs also great nightlife, shopping, entertainment, developed infrastructure, etc.

The countryside is beautiful - lush green and tranquil. The number of walking/hiking trails is pretty remarkable and easily accessible, and there‚Äôs also an extensive rugged coastline to explore.

1995,1708638991.0,Blended foot is better and more convenient than unblended food.,"Recently, I had the unfortunate experience of losing all my teeth, which required me to blend all my food and drink it through one of those large bubble tea straws. I won't get into how I lost my teeth because it's embarassing and not the point of this discussion, so don't ask.

But anyways, at first it was gross but now that I'm used to it, I think it is superior than the normal method of consumption. It's less messy, you don't need utensils, and it's way easier and portable and it just tastes better. I no longer have to waste time eating breakfast, I can just blend it up and drink it along with my coffee on the way to work. Same for lunch and dinner. I don't need to carry a lunchbox, just a cup. I feel like it's easier to digest and I no longer have to deal with constipiasion, although I do admit that this diet does give me the squirts. That's the only downside. Still, the body does not need to waste energy breaking down the food, since it's already been broken down, therefore I have excess energy for other things like brainpower and muscle building. I'm not a sciencetist or anything, but just think about it, the logic makes sense, right? Anyways, I digress.  In summary, blended food is:

* more convinient
* easier to digest
* tastes better once you get used to the texture
* makes it easier to eat healthy foods you don't like, like brocolli and eggplant
* can mix with sodas and coffee, or gatorade if you're exercising and need energy
* is better overall

1998,1708614792.0,There's too much singing on modern mainstream animation.,"In general, there's nothing wrong with a musical animated show/movie. Some of my favorite shows like Bob's Burgers, the Simpsons, and Morel Oral have musical episodes, or devote time specifically for the characters to sing. It can be fun, especially if the voice actors can sing.  
  
That being said, there really should be less of it. There should be more adult animated shows that don't do songs every episode. Animated kid's shows/movies don't have to end in a dance party or sing to progress the plot. It seems like a factory standard to do it that way. (Especially in the West.)  
  
The Into the Spiderverse series is a great example of using music to enhance the experience. Miles singing along with the first song then not again for the rest of the movie was fun! It was a hint of his character, and we still got to experience the music! It's just one example, but there could be more that's done to keep music in without adding singing.

* He is resourceful. He doesn't care about hiring bounty hunters, which the empire leadership considers ""scum"". He does what needs to be done to get the job done, and in that case, the job got done.
* He does not tolerate incompetence among people who were put in a leadership position. When he chokes the generals to death, it is not because of pure villainy. It is because his general's bad decisions put unnecessary risk to empire , like alerting the rebels the Empire is coming to Hoth (which required a ground assault, costing men's lives).
* He also takes the time to go personally to the guy who is building the new Death Star to warn him ""our boss is pissed,  you'd better go back to schedule"". He is a bro trying to help his buddy before it is too late.
* On the other hand he promotes individuals who are smart. Like the dude who read a strange signal from the probe droid which might have indicated the rebel base was in Hoth.
