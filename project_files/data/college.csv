20,1595636765.0,An Honest Letter from Your University President About Why We're Opening This Fall,"Dear faculty,

Oh, and staff. Sorry, we keep forgetting you exist. So sorry. You're like the middle child of higher education. You've been so quiet since you realized that unlike faculty we'll actually fire you for speaking up.

Many of you have expressed concern with our plans to move ahead with in-person classes this fall. I personally find the plan to be relatively simple.

All we need to do to safely and successfully reopen is require everyone to wear a mask at all times, test all students, faculty and staff for COVID-19 before fall semester starts, require all students to self-isolate for 14 days before they arrive, split most of our classes into two groups that will never meet together in-person, remove half the furniture from all of our classrooms and public spaces, dedicate entire ~~dorms~~ residence halls to housing sick students, train faculty to live stream their classes to remote students while juggling the virtual and in-person management of questions and feedback, assume students will maintain physical distance and wear masks when they're off campus, assume students won't go to any parties, prep faculty to move to remote instruction immediately if they get sick or have to self-quarantine, require faculty to designate a ""colleague on call"" to serve as their academic next of kin who'll teach their class for no additional pay if they get sick or die, rearrange foot traffic patterns in all of our buildings and stairwells, dramatically increase cleaning responsibilities for our overstretched environmental services team, completely change how we distribute food in dining halls, set the HVAC to blow as hard as possible in every building to keep air flow moving, hope our toxic work culture doesn't lead to people coming in sick despite us not updating our sick or leave policies to accommodate for a generational pandemic, and cross our fingers that we get to the point in the semester where we don't have to give refunds for housing or dining plans when we move to all online instruction anyway.

I don't see what's so complicated.

But since you all keep *insisting* on asking why we're taking such a ""risk"" in the midst of an unprecedented global pandemic in a country with a negligent federal response and a bunch of morons who think this is all a hoax and that mask wearing is how Bill ""5G"" Gates will steal their rights or whatever, I'm writing to clarify the university's motivations for fall.

**Money.**

Oh my god *we're so boned* if we don't get more money.

Do you not realize how much of our funding is based on dramatically overpriced housing and food? Do you not know what an auxiliary service is? *Have you not noticed a bottle of Diet Coke is $4.50 in the cafeteria?* Do you not come to the budget meetings we schedule once a year at 6:30pm the Friday before a holiday weekend?

Our endowment is like your savings account: Woefully inadequate and incapable of saving you. If we lose that sweet, sweet housing and food money we are going to have to fire at least a third of you to keep our own jobs safe, but at least we'll have a good reason to ditch those of you with tenure we don't like because you criticized us once three years ago. I'm coming for you, *Christina*.

So buck up, cupcake. Be resilient. Double your workload so you can help us maintain the façade that opening for in-person instruction is somehow going to be safe until we hit the tuition and housing due date.

We *need you* to do all this extra work so we can get that sweet, sweet student money and stay afloat. *You* are how we are going to get through this. ~~We're going to squeeze you dry and then ask for more (NOTE: Let's remove this line before we hit send).~~ By the way, here's a website about self-care that has three broken links to in-person yoga classes from last year.

This *will* involve you spending the summer designing your course twice for both in-person and online instruction. Extra funding? Hahahahahaha Nah, but here's a webcam and the login page for Zoom. Make it work.

To answer another question you've been pestering us with: Yes, we *have* noticed all the local K12 school districts are going to be starting the school year online. As such, I've directed HR to do absolutely nothing to accommodate those of you who have been audacious enough to procreate. Figure it out. We can always replace you with a grad student or post doc who's desperate enough to barely scrape by. Your call.

What? No, no we definitely won't be paying you more for the extra work you're doing.

Yes, this is probably your new normal workload moving forward if you're lucky enough to survive the Hunger Games machinations our CFO will be doing this fall.

No, we won't guarantee you won't be furloughed or fired anyway in two months.

Yes, this will put the Black and Latinx members of our community at risk since they're disproportionately represented on our environmental services staff. Unrelated note: Did I mention we're changing the name of that building that's been named after a white supremacist the past 83 years? I, for one, am grateful to be a part of solving racism forever.

Where was I again? Oh yes, money.

We need money to under pay you, the staff, and the adjuncts who teach 83% of our courses. So take this mask we paid too much to put our logo on and get to work. At least until the tuition refund deadline passes.

Love,

Your University President

We're in the middle of a pandemic, everyone knows that. Usual financial and health problems are worse for everyone, there's more anxiety in the air due to elections and covid, yet students don't seem to be getting any sort of recognition for the unusual times. The workload is as much as ever, no pass/fail grades, a lower quality of education online(I love online but it's still lower quality on average and everyone agrees on this)

But when it comes to problems with distance learning from the college's side(bad technology set ups, online exams not working etc), the excuse I'm given from them is that 'its a pandemic, we're trying to adjust to the new circumstances'. Well no shit so are we! You keep classes at the same difficulty, if not higher and want us to feel bad for you when you're not prepared to provide us a high quality education for literally thousands of dollars??

This guy lets in kids who are late but slammed the door for me, at 8am. The quiz had not even started. 

Since I had to take a 0 my quiz average dropped significantly (this is 1/3 of our grade).

I went up to him after class (he let me in after the quiz) and he told me too bad, I should’ve showed up at 7:59.

I WAS ON TIME. I feel like this is incredibly unreasonable and I do not know what to do.

Edit: emailed department chair, she basically talked to him and said that the quiz had already started so I need to go to his office hours and try and deal with it on my own. 

Edit: my final grade drops from an A- to a B+ (only 3 points - but still significant) 

Edit: appreciate the somewhat harsh feedback, I do need to be earlier. I literally show up like 7:57 every class and never have a problem. I just thought it was crazy to make my grade suffer when I was there at the stated time. But yes, I know how important timing is IRL

>**Today, a guy in my class made me a sandwich. It was turkey, cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes. Does this mean he likes me? Or was he just being friendly?**

And then a week after that, I posted an update:

>**I had a ton of people telling me to make him a sandwich back, so I decided to do it! When our lecture ended today, I walked up to him and told him that I made him a sandwich. When I handed it to him, he had a huge smile on his face and said, ""Wow thanks! I appreciate that"". We then ended up chatting for a bit and exchanged instas.**

So here's the final update - A lot of redditors were telling me to message him on insta first and to ask him to study for finals with me. So I listened to everyone and messaged him last week! He agreed to it and we ended up studying together and getting to know each other. We took our final exam last thursday, and after that he asked if I wanted to have dinner with him to celebrate the last day of school. I told him that I couldn't because I had car racing practice that night. So he then asked me if he can watch me practice, and I said yeah.

So that night, he watched me drive lap after lap. Then after my practice when my coach left, sandwich guy asked me if he can try out my car. Typically, you need a racing license to drive a formula vee at my local track, but I wanted him to like me so I let him ride it. I taught him how to drive it and he loved it. It was so much fun!

38,1647289406.0,"I banked on my professor basing his final exam on previous quizzes, I was right, now I'm being accused of cheating.","Had a class over this term with a professor who wasn't the best and I could tell that he didn't really care about teaching his class. We had a 10 multiple choice question quiz once a week in place of tests that were based on short readings from various webpages that he would give us. I was sitting at a high B and really wanted an A in the class. 

The week before the final he told us that the test would be based on the readings he gave us, and based on how short they were and the fact that I have had other bad professors do the same thing, I assumed he was just going to reuse quiz questions on the final. Rather than studying normally I dug through my old quizzes and made a document with every question and correct answer. Over the course of a few evenings I studied the paper as much as I could and got to the point where I had memorized the answer to all 90 questions.

Last Friday I showed up to take my exam, I sat down in my desk with nothing but a pencil and was ready to take my test. When he handed me my exam I was absolutely stoked to see that the first question was the first question from quiz 1. I answered it quickly and started to scan the page and realized that the final was every quiz question (with some removed to make the test 50 questions) in chronological order.

It took me about 10 minutes to finish the exam, and in hindsight I realize I probably should have sat around for a while but I was hungry and wanted to leave so I went to his desk, turned in my test, was told I would get my grade on Monday at 9am and left.

Fast forward to today and instead of getting a grade I got an email asking for me to come to my professor's office. When I got there he sat me down and said that he found it hard to believe that a student who struggled to get a low B on his quizzes throughout the term could be the only student to get a 100% in 10 minutes. He then told me that he made a request to be sent security camera footage from the exam and that he would be looking over it later today and asked if I had anything to say.

I told him that I assumed he was going to reuse questions on the final and that I just studied old quizzes and he seemed to get a little frustrated, and told me that using test banks can be considered academic dishonesty and that he may have to elevate this further.

Long story short, I misread and did question 26 instead of 36. He has a rule that something like that results in an automatic zero. I didn’t really get it at first, and I said oh so I just got that answer wrong then, and he said no you got a zero. Then I realized he meant I got a zero for the entire homework set. 

I didn’t really believe him at first, but he said it’s a rule he as it’s a way he’s found students cheating off of each other in the past. Unfortunately for me, question 26 was assigned last semester, so not only did I misread, but I did a question that was assigned the previous semester which made me look bad.

I told him I’d rather he think I was stupid than I cheated, and I didn’t cheat. He told me since I confronted him he doesn’t think I cheated and that if I hadn’t spoken to him he would’ve thought otherwise. Then I started to cry, just because I was feeling overwhelmed, the class is difficult, and I really need to pass the class in order to take the next set of classes. Then I started to cry more because I was embarrassed. He told me not to cry and that I would be fine, and that he would assign a bonus homework. He said I made a blunder, which aren’t allowed in the real world and to think of it as a learning experience.

I tried to get it together but couldn’t and was more embarrassed and cried some more. Then I just dipped without saying bye, and I feel bad.

Should I email an apology for my reaction? 
Anyways, thanks in advance.",college
61,1598314997.0,Please don’t do this. Worst ice-breaker ever.,"My professor decided to go around the (virtual) room and have us each say our names and what internship we had this summer to break the ice. He specifically asked for our internships. Over half of the class awkwardly came up one-by-one to say that they couldn’t find an internship or that their internship had been cancelled. I, luckily, had found a research position over the summer, so I was able to talk about mine, but I spent as little time as possible on it. 

Nobody wants to gloat about their internships when over half of the class lost theirs, and nobody who lost theirs wants to get up in front of the class and talk about how they lost it. We’re all seniors in STEM, so it was pretty important that we found an internship this summer, which made it even worse.

71,1592159754.0,Stop looking down on people for their choice of major," I am tired of people telling me that my major is ""useless"" and that I'll never use it in the real world if I don't go to grad school. I'm tired of people judging me for spending MY money (I pay for my own college, my parents don't help out) on something that I enjoy doing. I'm tired of people judging others for majoring in something ""useless"" or ""easy"" or ""low-paying"" while being completely ignorant of what others go through. So, to all the people who have majors that correlate to well-paying, specific entry-level jobs post-college and constantly berate others for trying to live THEIR lives, pay close attention.

1. Not everyone wants to do what you do. Do you ever think about that? We don't all want to be software engineers or nurses or business analysts etc. People have different interests and enjoy having the freedom to pursue those interests. If people want to study anthro, let them do it. If they want to study music, let them! Don't be an asshole. You would be surprised by all of the opportunities you don't know exist that people in the ""useless"" majors have that you could never dream of.
2. Not everyone has the aptitude for it. Yeah, I'm tired of hearing people tell others ""wHY diDN't yoU JuST do ENGinEEriNG?"" as if they know the person they are telling this to better than they know themselves. Stuff like that requires a higher level of understanding of math and science that not everyone can ""just do."" Just because it's easy for you or you are driven to succeed in it doesn't mean everyone else can. Forcing people into engineering or comp sci (for example) when they aren't good at math or coding only for them to get a 2.2 GPA and learn nothing and not get any internships because of their horrendous academic performance isn't going to do anyone any good.
3. Going off of the last point, just because someone isn't cut out for a certain major doesn't make them stupid. We are all different and we are all naturally good at different things. For example, I hate public speaking and being in front of people. I would be an awful performing arts/theatre major. Does that make me stupid? Of course not. I am not a big fan of working with kids all day. I know for a fact I would not be able to handle majoring in elementary education. Does not being able to handle the elementary ed curriculum make me a failure? No, it doesn't. Everyone has their own limitations and it's nothing to be ashamed of. I would like you to consider how well you would do if you were suddenly placed in a major like that.
4. Just because you think your major is ""hard"" that doesn't automatically mean everyone else's majors are ""easy."" I get it, especially as a science major myself. We tend to think that we are on more difficult path because of the coursework. However, that doesn't mean ours is harder, it just means it's hard in a different way. For instance, philosophy majors have to become really good at critical thought, which is an excellent skill to have and something most of us are severely lacking. Education majors have to become very knowledgeable in a subject area and be able to teach it to kids/teens/etc, which is something I think would be incredibly difficult. Classics majors, depending on the school, develop a high level of understanding of Greek and Latin and learn to write well in these languages, which is an amazing ability because writing in English is already hard enough. I encourage you all to check out the curriculums of these so-called ""easy"" majors.
5. Not everyone is motivated by money. Yes, money is good, I agree. However, there are people out there that want to pursue something they are passionate about and couldn't care less how much it paid. It is far better to study something you want to study and take a lower paying job and being happy with it than it is to study something just because ""it's going to get me money"" and then be miserable for the next 40 years of your life.
6. You don't have to go into the field that you majored in. I know this is gonna be a hard pill for all you specific entry level job majors to swallow, but it's true. You can take the skills you learned in any major and apply them broadly. If you know how to market yourself and you take advantage of the opportunities that are presented to you or the one's that you seek out, then you will be fine. Do you honestly think people don't have a plan? Yes, I am sure some don't, but the majority do have some sort of direction they are looking towards going and they have a college degree to help them out.

In conclusion, stop judging people for choosing what THEY want to do with THEIR college experience. All majors are respectable and offer something unique to the world. No major is useless and no major is easy and some people want more out of life than money. I can already see what the comments section is going to look like now: ""bUt maJOrInG in EnLIsH/tHEaTRe/mUSIc/PoliSCI/BioLOGy/whateverelsepeoplethinkisuselesswithoutgoingtogradschool Is NoT SMArt BecAUSe YoU wONt MaKE moNEy & tHEn YoU WOnt gET a JoB in THat FielD.""

104,1573592578.0,Writing Prof Here: How to Add to Essay Length Without Fluff or Format Cheating,"Alright folks, instead of the normal depressing content on the sub, Christmas is coming early ...though perhaps a bit boring. This is like getting socks. But hey, I know a lot of you need socks, so it's not that bad.

Common problem I'm sure a lot of you are facing is how to reach essay minimum page requirements. I'm here to help. This is only really looking at one specific technique, there's lots of others, and maybe I'll do write ups on them also. The key here though is that this *isn't* about just padding your essay. It's about reaching the minimum length *by doing what you're actually expected to do.* It's like cheating on a test by smuggling notes in your brain.

Let's take a hypothetical essay discussing polarizing foods. Here's a stereotypically bad bit of (hypothetical) student writing:

>One food that causes a lot of debate is pineapple on pizza. In Haidt's article he finds that 40% of people hate pineapple on pizza. This clearly shows pineapple is one of the most controversial foods on pizza.

Shit. We just covered pineapple in like 2 lines of text. That was going to be the centerpiece of the essay!

To improve on this, always look for more clarity, depth, and specificity. We'll start with the first sentence. ...Is there evidence of this debate we can point to?

>One food that causes a lot of debate is pineapple on pizza. For instance, a Reddit post ranked pineapple on pizza as the most controversial food.

Good start, but what lots of details are missing.

>For instance, a Reddit post on the popular r/askreddit forum asked community members what food they found to be the most controversial and pineapple was the clear winner.

Better, but we're using an internet sources a lot of folks aren't familiar with. Is it credible? More detail helps:

>For instance, a Reddit post on the popular r/askreddit forum asked community members what food they found to be the most controversial. The post received a net 14,000 upvotes and 3,000 comments. The highest voted comment was for pineapple on pizza. But, pineapple on pizza wasn't just the top response; it also ranked 7th, 14th, and 17th.

Our first sentence has now become longer than the entire original paragraph just be expanding on the ""causes a lot of debate"" idea. Now let's move on to ""In Haidt's article he finds that 40% of people hate pineapple on pizza.""

First we need to tell the audience who this guy is.

>Jonathan Haidt is an ethics professor at the NYU Stern School of Business and has written extensively on the subject of disgust.

After that, we should give more detail about just what the study found (I'm making up the study, btw, but Haidt does study disgust). We should provide more detail about the specific research results, and can add a bit of narrative about the research methods as well.

>In a study of 300 college students in New York City, Haidt found that on a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is ""strongly dislike"" and 5 is ""strongly like,"" 40% of respondents ranked pineapple on pizza at 1, while 30% ranked it at 5. Only 3% put it in the middle with a rank of 3.

In the original, 40% disliking it didn't actually tell us it was controversial, it told us only a lot of people hate it -- but we need to know how many like it as well, and the number of ambivalent people is another useful detail. We can go into more depth with some added context drawn from other questions in the study:

>While pineapple had 70% of all respondents answering 1 or 5, sausage only had 30% in either category, with only 5% saying they strongly dislike it.

Good, that tells us how it compares to an uncontroversial topping. How does it rate among other controversial toppings though?

>Compared to other controversial toppings, pineapple is still very polarizing. For instance, olives only had 40% ranking it 1 or 5, bell peppers had 30%, and mushrooms were at 55%. The only thing with more results at the extremes was anchovies with 90% having a strong opinion, though 85% ranked it at 1, showing it isn't controversial, just universally disliked.

Holy cow, now we've got ourselves a real life college essay paragraph. Let's put the pieces together and see how she looks:

>One food that causes a lot of debate is pineapple on pizza. For instance, a Reddit post on the popular r/askreddit forum asked community members what food they found to be the most controversial. The post received a net 14,000 upvotes and 3,000 comments. The highest voted comment was for pineapple on pizza. But, pineapple on pizza wasn't just the top response; it also ranked 7th, 14th, and 17th. Jonathan Haidt is an ethics professor at the NYU Stern School of Business and has written extensively on the subject of disgust. In a study of 300 college students in New York City, Haidt found that on a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is ""strongly dislike"" and 5 is ""strongly like,"" 40% of respondents ranked pineapple on pizza at 1, while 30% ranked it at 5. Only 3% put it in the middle with a rank of 3. While pineapple had 70% of all respondents answering 1 or 5, sausage only had 30% in either category, with only 5% saying they strongly dislike it. Compared to other controversial toppings, pineapple is still very polarizing. For instance, olives only had 40% ranking it 1 or 5, bell peppers had 30%, and mushrooms were at 55%. The only thing with more results at the extremes was anchovies with 90% having a strong opinion, though 85% ranked it at 1, showing it isn't controversial, just universally disliked.

That's more than half a page (TNR 12, double spaced).

Now what about the last line from the original? ""This clearly shows pineapple is one of the most controversial foods on pizza.""

Cut it. Don't need it. If I clearly showed you something, I don't need to tell you that I clearly showed you it. You know.

But wait, we're not done! We can get even more mileage out of this by commenting on the limitations of the study:

>It should be noted that the study was only of college students in New York City, and there may be a regional preference.

Again, we can expand this with greater levels of detail and specificity.

>It should be noted that the study was only of college students in New York City, and regional preferences may have influenced the results. Food preferences and traditions are known to vary from one region to the next, and pizza in particular has regional variations such as the Chicago deep dish. It may be that in some places were pineapple is more popular, pineapple on pizza is less of a contentious issue.

And, if you need to squeeze a little more mileage out of it, add a bit of your research narrative:

>However, in researching this topic, I was not able to find a study that compared regional attitudes towards pineapple on pizza.

That's all there is to it.

...One huge caveat of course. Expanding your writing in this way first requires that you have a clue what the heck you're talking about. You need to have done the research, have actual good sources, and understand the sources and your subject to be able to discuss it in a nuanced manner. If you're still in camp ""lol didn't read,"" this isn't going to help you much.",college

Even if you filed taxes as an individual. Nor will your parents be receiving the $500 check if you are not less than 17 years old.

Personally I am just super disappointed. This money would’ve helped me pay for my college tuition but **yet again** the government purposely excludes college students. There seems to be a lot of outrage amongst college students on twitter as well.

Edit: and of course the “college students have enough and don’t need anything else” crowd shows up lol

**Bottom line is, our parent’s tax returns don’t directly cover our own expenses. Not everyone is privileged to have their college paid for and just because others have it worse, doesn’t mean we shouldn’t benefit. To say that college students shouldn’t get anything because (essentially) “they have more than enough from being considered dependent” is grossly naive.

Universities are taking this seriously. They don't care about your opinion on covid-19. They will take the precautions and send you HOME.

1. This post was for people who are attending large gatherings with no mask on.

2. Yes, college can be about fun. I loved going to parties and bars with my friends. Right now we need to wait. We are literally going through a PANDEMIC. Yes, you may not be high risk and healthy but those around you may not. 

3. One semester without partying isn't gonna hurt you. 

4. Do you want the same scenario that recently happened at UNC? No? Then practice social distancing and avoid large gatherings.

Edit 2: Some of you are really exhausting me so I will explain it again. This post is in regards to those that are attending large parties during a PANDEMIC.

He talked about how drugged and controlling she was all 3 days of class, and called her a whore. Every word that came out of his mouth was ignorant and superficial. All 60ish of us huffed and puffed at everything he said. He barely even discussed what we’re supposed to be learning or doing in the course, all we did was cruddy introductions, and then on wednesday, he decided it was hilarious to introduce his next talking point by loudly banging on this metal cowbell with a kitchen mallet, incessantly for over 2 minutes!!!
I received an email about an hour ago that the instructor has been let go, and we will have our course reassigned in the next 24 hours.

I’m convinced he must’ve not read it 😂 either way I’m so relieved and so happy to be done with that. Ended the class with an A- and overall made the Dean’s List this semester! LET’S FUCKING GOOOO!!

Original Post:

I didn’t even know that this was humanly possible, but I did it. Somehow. 

I had this paper that was assigned in MARCH and my professor repeatedly told us all over and over again throughout the semester, “please do not wait until the last minute to write this paper. I promise you will regret it. Please please start it early and do a little bit each day.”

Well what did my dumbass do? I started the paper 4 hours before it was due. I have never regretted a decision so much in my entire life. I’ve always said that I have no regrets, but for the first time in my life, I have a regret.

I was crying the whole time while writing this paper and felt intense anxiety the entire 4 hours but I did it. I somehow fucking did it. I genuinely did not think I would pull it off but somehow I submitted all 22 pages at 11:54 PM, just minutes before the deadline.

Now granted, they were 22 pages of pure dogshit and I’m probably gonna get a horrible grade but hey, given the circumstances I’m proud I at least finished it and powered through.

If y’all want an update once I find out my grade, let me know.

EDIT: A lot of you have been asking what the paper was so I’ll go ahead and explain. It wasn’t a research paper luckily so no sources needed or anything like that. It was for my marketing class and throughout the entire class we did a marketing simulation project where we had to run a business and marketing campaign selling products and it was divided into quarters. So the paper was basically explaining every single business decision you made in the simulation for each quarter and WHY you made that decision and what the result of each decision was and reflecting on the results so mentioning what you would have done differently, etc. Sounds like it wouldn’t take too long or be too difficult but you’d be surprised lol because overall there were A LOT of decisions made during the simulation and you had to go in depth on every one of them.",college

141,1643925357.0,I’m a college professor taking a freshman level course at a local community college and I got a 79 on our first exam,"I am working on completing an additional k-12 teaching certification and I needed 3 credits in a certain subject to finish.  It can be any course as long as it’s in the certain subject, so I found a freshman level course being offered online by a local community college to take.  I’m only 3 weeks in and I have a new empathy for my students.

As a student, I am incredibly anxious and perfectionist.  I have two bachelors and a masters degree, both of which I received with honors.  I’m a life long learner and quite honestly very interested in the subject matter of the class and have a good background in it, so I’m not sure if I am humbled or annoyed by my first test grade.

I very honestly studied.  The professor puts up power points to read and question guides to answer along with the power points.  I read EVERYTHING she posted, and I mean everything.  There were fyi handouts and videos that I read and viewed.  I filled in the review sheets.  I went back and reviewed the sheets and power points before the test.  I printed out the power points so I could have them as reference during the test as allowed.

So I kinda feel, if you have a student who is also a teacher, with a master degree, taking your freshman level course who can only get a 79….either something is wrong with the testing material or the teaching material.  Most of the questions I felt I knew with confidence but there were several that I felt were either super wordy to be confusing on purpose or I could have made a case for multiple correct answers.  I feel like I can clearly explain the material and the conclusions the professor is asking us to draw, but that is clearly not reflected in the grade.  I can not possibly imagine how a student right out of high school or brand new to college would have done well on that test.  I feel like they would be crying at the computer at the overload of information they were being asked to synthesize.

I know that not everyone gets A’s in everything.  Again, maybe just my ego is a bit bruised and I’m eating a slice of humble pie because I thought taking a freshman level course would be relatively easy for me.  I guess if you take anything from my ramble it’s to not beat your self up over not getting perfect grades all the time.  Sometimes even if you try your hardest, a 79 is the best you can get.

Little update: one of the questions I though was formatted incorrectly (like it was entered in as a single answer but should have been a multi answer) was confirmed to be incorrect by the professor and I was allowed to answer that question and gain the points there.  The professor also wrote me a nice email that once the test closes we could discuss the questions I got wrong as she felt the wording could have been tricky to understand.  So I do want to give her credit for a)responding quickly and kindly and b)being open to reflecting on the question integrity.

Other update: Thanks for everyone who commented and shared stories! I didn’t expect so many responses to my whining ha!  I have definitely learned a lot.  And yes, you can be a college professor with out a PhD.  My official title is assistant professor and I am tenure track.

Annnnddd one more update: The professor shared the class data, the class low was a 24, the mean a 67, the high a 100.  She felt two questions were not worded properly so they were thrown out.  There was also an extra credit opportunity on the test that I answered correctly, so I ended up with a 99.  Even with her throwing out two of the questions and the extra credit, more than half the class failed.",college

I've been struggling this semester with personal issues and decided to withdrawal from this particular course. The deadline to withdraw is not for another month so I've stayed enrolled to prepare for my second attempt and that leads me to my current issue. 

About 2 weeks ago, midterm 2 was scheduled. I didn't attend because I'm planning on withdrawing. Yesterday they posted the results and for some reason I got an 86%. Before the exam I had 62% in the class and now I'm at a 69% which means it's possible for me to pass the course (above 70%). This all brings me to my dilemma; I could let the professor know which would surely bring my grade below failing or I could wait it out and hope the mistake isn't caught allowing me the opportunity to pass. 

I honestly feel like I should email the professor and do the right thing but I wanted to know what everyone else thought. I've been thinking of nothing since when I saw the wrong grade and I have no idea what to do. Thanks in advance for the help!

EDIT: Just thought I'd update those who are curious. I decided to attend office hours a few days after this and explained the whole situation. The professor seemed surprised and was very grateful that I told him the truth. He said he will be changing my grade to a zero because it's a required course and the material is bound to show up again which I completely understand. He offered some extra credit in the form of attendance points (my attendance has been lacking) but I declined and told him I was planning on withdrawing before the whole mistake. Sure, I could've said nothing but it would've been weighing on my conscious for god knows how long so I'm glad I told the truth.

155,1683164995.0,I did it! I finished my undergraduate degree with a 4.0 GPA!,"It's been a while since I made a post on this subreddit, but I wanted to just say that I finally did it. After five years of undergraduate classes (first community college, then transferred to a uni), I have officially completed my degree with a 4.0 GPA. I made A's in every single class I have ever taken, in both community college and university.

I started college in 2018 as a shy almost 20-year-old who was very unconfident in my abilities. I ended up not only doing well in class, but I joined the student government association and became an advocate for my fellow students. I became comfortable with public speaking and gave many speeches at my school.  I graduated from CC in 2021, right after the horribleness that was Covid19 and getting dumped by my first boyfriend (whom I'd signed a lease to move in with at a university)

I ended up not going to the university I'd originally planned for, since it had been mostly my ex's idea in the first place. I instead applied for a well-known and prestigious local private university. I got accepted with an almost full-ride scholarship and was determined to keep my grades just as good as before.

It was hard. Unlike my community college, the university used a +/- system, meaning I needed to maintain a 93 in every class instead of a 90. I also had to *always* maintain taking 5 classes (15 credit hours) to keep a grant I got to pay for the remainder of my tuition. I commuted 35 minutes daily, attended events, did a work-study for 10 hours a week, got involved with the student government, and more.

I finished my last ever class on Monday and found out today about my grade on my final. I made a 100, meaning that I was able to make a 95 in the class and keep my 4.0 GPA. I'm extremely proud of myself and the stress was well worth it because I got offered a position at my university that I have accepted. The position didn't even exist and was created specifically for me, so that they could keep me on board.

I know this post is long, and I'm sorry for that. I'm just so happy that I have been able to make my parents proud as a first generation college student.

TDLR: I finished my undergraduate with a 4.0 after five years of hard work. Also got hired at my university for a full-time position.

Half the assignment was discussing which modes of transportation are more or less common and where they're most often used. Totally fine. 

The second half of the assignment was reading the country's national transit company's website and watching their COVID-specific informational/rule videos and reading a commuter blog FAQ about the new restrictions. 

None of the information is anything radically different than the guidance we're getting from credible medical professionals in the United States, so there's no real ""cultural difference""  learning goal involved in researching the other country's protocols. Besides, it's not like any of us can leave the country right now anyways, so whatever small bit of country-specific information we are getting about their situation is unlikely to be useful by the time we are allowed to travel there: these restrictions will have been significantly lifted or changed by then. 

As a language instructor myself, I get that they're trying to make the assignment relevant and give us the vocabulary for our new situation, but I don't think professors understand that regardless of how lax or seriously they think their students are taking the pandemic, we're all sick (no pun intended) and tired of hearing and thinking about it constantly. I take my classes to bury my head away from the outside world, to hunker down alone in my apartment and immerse myself in the subjects I love, not to have to engage with faux-cheery soulless mask-wearing cartoons riding a train over and over again to get the gist of the material or to have to try to redefine everything I hate about moving about in the world right now into another language.

I was going through my day as normal, and then I went to my 1:40 class. In this class, the professor talked for about 5 minutes, then turned off all the lights and played a 50-minute documentary on which the students were supposed to be taking notes. I was taking notes for about 20 minutes, but unfortunately, the monotone documentary mixed with my sleep deprivation got the best of me and I fell asleep for 15-20 minutes before waking back up and continuing to take notes.

The professor did not say anything about it, and while I felt guilty, I continued with my day.

I might understand if this was a continuous thing or if I was falling asleep during a lecture that he was leading, but this seems like an unprofessional and honestly unreasonable email to send, especially considering he sent the email almost 20 hours after class.

He was also extremely eager to help me, and would ignore my lab partner, which I found strange because he was struggling more than I was. I was a bit uncomfortable, but I wasn’t sure it was flirting and so I ignored it. The next couple labs went well, he didn’t really have an opportunity to talk to me but I hoped it was just a one time thing.

Today, we were doing a lab with a long wait time, so he was talking to me and another group for a while. The other group finished and left, and then all his attention was on me (ignoring my lab partner again). It started with a continuation of his conversation with the other group, about hobbies and academics. He asked what I do on the weekends and seemed upset when I said I drive home for the weekend. He asked if I like clubbing, and when I said no, he said he’ll bring me out of my shell? He also told me I’m free to visit his apartment and he’d show me how to play a game, and asked for my Snapchat. I didn’t know how to say no, but I’m pretty uncomfortable with all of this.

184,1604426993.0,An Honest Letter from Your University President About Fall and Our Plans for Spring,"Dear faculty and students,

Oh, and staff. I keep doing that. If I had any shame at all, I’d feel embarrassed. It’s so hard to remember people that don’t have academic freedom. You’re like Gen X; angsty and frequently forgotten in conversation.

I’m writing to follow up on my original post: [An Honest Letter from Your University President About Why We’re Opening This Fall](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/hxd9z8/an_honest_letter_from_your_university_president/)

First, I’d like to address the disappointing survey results we received from you. Yes, faculty, over 17% of the student body is currently in quarantine or isolation, but we gave you a Zoom license and a 720p webcam with a microphone that captures all sound within a two and a half foot radius. Be resilient. This sounds like a “You” problem. If you need help, ask the instructional technology group that we’ve underfunded for the past decade and kept on a hiring freeze even after they lost a quarter of their staff to private industry. 

And please stop asking if the students in quarantine are okay. They’re perfectly safe in the Holiday Inn down the road. No, the bad one. Dining Services is making sure they get their meals at least three times a week. Breakfast is an overripe grapefruit and Saltines. The vegetarian option is a chicken salad sandwich. We include a 6oz bottle of water. That’s 2oz per meal! For those of you who’ve asked: the wifi matches the quality of a strong home internet connection from 1997, so don’t let them lie to you when they get kicked out of your hybrid/flexible/in-person/circus/flipped/blended/shitshow/mishmash/Sisyphean instruction on Zoom because “their internet cut out”. They’re fine. 

Students: We built our entire reopening plan around your ability to do something all 18-22 year-olds excel at: Self control. Yes, this has led to a massive uncontrolled outbreak on campus, which is why we need to assign blame to the people who’ve done the most to create these incredibly dangerous circumstances: **You**. I cannot believe that when freed from the restrictions of home life with your parents, the first thing you decide to do is try to *make friends*. I mean, who does that? It's not like we've spent your entire lives selling you on the college experience. We’re trusting you.

Faculty: Since we don’t trust the ~~scapegoats~~ students, and to reassure the business faculty who are assigning tests that Pearson and McGraw Hill wrote in 2003, we’ve invested heavily in Proctorio. This will allow us to surveil the students from the discomfort of their apartment or dorm room (sorry, “residence hall”). Blinking more than 15 times in a minute, wearing red sweatpants, or having dark skin will automatically fail the student and trigger a meeting with the student conduct board. Via Zoom, of course. 

Now then, on to spring. I know many of you are feeling tired from not having any fall break, but good news! This proves we can get through a semester without *any* break. Maybe even \[drum roll\] spring break! That’s right! Instead of a much-needed break in the middle of one of the coldest, darkest, most uncomfortable times of the year with no major holidays or time off between January and April, we’ve opted to eliminate spring break in 2021. For those of you feeling stressed, we encourage you to try any of the following meditative exercises our Wellness Czar/CFO has provided:

* Spend time reflecting on how lucky you are to have a job. 
* Create a spreadsheet of how expensive it’d be to take a job at the next closest university 58.3 miles away. 
* Disconnect from social media.
* Calculate the chances someone with COVID actually washed their hands properly after they left the communal bathroom you just used. 
* Make a list of how many days it’d take for you to become homeless if you quit right now. 

If you are a faculty or staff member who fought us tooth and nail for accommodations to work remotely this fall, this does mean you’ll need to re-apply for spring. The application process will require you to submit the following to HR: A form with a detailed rationale about why you need accommodations (with citations in MLA 9th edition format), two doctor’s notes (one must be from your dentist), a Starbucks gift card with exactly $2.37 left on it, blood samples from your children that you personally extracted, a fourth grade report card (doesn’t have to be yours), the last five digits of your mother’s social security number, and President Obama’s long form birth certificate. The original. If you cannot provide these things, your application will be rejected. This policy should help the administration continue its decades-long tradition of disproportionately disenfranchising our female faculty and staff who have children *and* the desire to follow a meaningful career path in their field. 

Now to answer some other questions you’ve been collectively ~~pestering us with~~ asking:

No, we will not acknowledge the backbreaking burden of the affective labor staff have been doing since March. I don’t care if you’re not “fine”. Do the same thing I’m convinced you do when you say you’re working remotely: Pretend you are. Our faculty need strong, reassuring leadership, which is why  you as the people tasked with executing the mission we've created with no input, representation, or feedback from you are going to provide it. Act like everything’s normal and do it with a smile, sweetheart. 

No, we will not be paying the Student Life staff more despite the extraordinary circumstances. We let them live for free in the same dorms as their COVID-infected classmates, who they are now required to check in on daily so my administrative assistant can tell these annoying parents that their student’s taken care of when they call. The dozens of hours of overtime this semester on top of their regular courseload mean nothing. You thought we meant it when we said ""Their first job is being a student?"" Bahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, oh that was good. Wait wait, let me get the senior staff on a Zoom call so you can say that again. They're going to love this! Oh, and tell the RAs to consider this semester a life lesson on what it means to be on salary, and that “Other duties as assigned” is a literal statement. 

Yes, this semester has put the Black, Hispanic, and Latinx members of our community at higher risk since they're disproportionately represented on our environmental services and dining staff. But if they don’t like it, they can just go get another job. It’s not like we’re in the midst of a second generational recession. I mean could you even *imagine*? 

No, we will not be doing pass/fail this semester. Why does everyone keep asking that? Be resilient! When I was a junior in college I got strep throat and was out of class a whole afternoon! I did the work to keep up despite the massive hurdles placed in front of me, and I expect the same of our students. 

I feel this must be said in closing: You all seem to have forgotten that a key part of the administration’s COVID strategy is **Performative Normalcy**, so don’t expect your “pedagogical mission” or “safety” to trump our operations. We are back in-person for a reason: **Money**. I don’t know how you missed this. We sent it via email at 5:01 on last Friday, 23 minutes after we’d sent another email announcing the largest uncontrolled outbreak of the semester. Contact your supervisor if you need productivity tips for managing your email.

It helps because I have a lot of doctor appointments because of my disability and I can easily forget if I have homework due if I don’t have a physical reminder so that text notification is really helpful.

Most people don’t wanna see a tree die so it helps forces you to get off your phone and actually focus on what you are doing in that moment.

Edit x4: If you have problems with retaining info then I suggest you write you notes in class on paper and then transfer to computer app such as Microsoft OneNote or Evernote. Since you are rewriting it you naturally will retain more of it.",college

Because I signed up for housing that is gender-specific, I am uncomfortable with this arrangement because I chose to live with a man. I am not transphobic in any way, I just want live with the gender I chose to live with.

He was fine when he taught lecture on Monday, said he'd see us today, but apparently had a heart aneurysm or something and passed away suddenly on Tuesday morning in his office. The chem department head came to inform us in class and introduced us to the professor that is going to be teaching us for the rest of the semester, who said he would try to keep the class as similar to the way our previous prof did as possible. I guess I'm just in shock and grieving... Our prof was really good and was so excited for the next chapter coming up! He wasn't even that old. Never would have expected it. I'm also nervous the next exam, which is coming up in 2 weeks, because I have no idea how this new prof writes exams and what his expectations are.

197,1674140543.0,How do I nicely ask my professor to stop lecturing 15 mins after class ends?,"He has an attitude problem and takes everything personally. The class starts at 5:15pm and ends at 6:45 pm so its an inconvenient time and its pretty long. He usually tells us to just keep sitting and let him finish and sometimes he doesn’t finish talking until 7. Its pretty annoying and i feel awkward telling him its time to leave because his answer is always “let me just finish up”.

Update: So, u/seacaptain200 wrote a professional and respectful sounding email, so I used the template they gave me and around 3:30 pm today I wrote my professor an email that said “dear professor X, I want to confirm we meet for class from 5:15 to 6:45 pm, correct? I have other obligations after class and will need to leave promptly at the end of our scheduled class-time each night. Respectfully, (my name)”

He emailed back like 5 mins later “please refer to your syllabus if you can not remember what time our class is scheduled.”. I look at the syllabus. 5:15 to 6:45. I look at my actual class schedule, 5:15 to 6:45. Im confused why he had to word it like that. So I go to class, everyone starts to pack their things at 6:45, and he says “I’m not done, please don’t start packing your things yet.” 

I sent that email, so I continue to pack my stuff and I stand up and he tells me to sit back down, so I said “I’m sorry, I have something to do tonight. I sent you an email earlier today, I can not stay past when class ends anymore.”, and a few other people were trying to leave too when i said that and he says he will mark us all absent if we leave but I said i attended the entire class and if he does that i’ll ask the dean to take a look because I have proof I attended the whole class for the time we are supposed to be there, and he smiled at me and the other students leaving and said “bye-bye” like a weird evil villain. 

I’m going to try and make an appointment to meet with my professor tomorrow to try and smooth things over because I do want to stay in the class and learn the material, but now he is really starting to scare me. If he did count me absent I will try emailing the dean.

Update 2: I went to his office this morning, i apologized again and said i did not intend to offend him or cause a scene, and said i genuinely had somewhere to be. i have classes with no more than 10 min breaks in between from 12 pm to 6:45 pm, so when 6:45 roll around I’m starving and ready to be out of class, and the dining hall also closes at 7pm. He asks where I had to be(like its even any of his business), and i begin saying what i just said about my schedule, and he interrupts me and goes “i didnt ask for your life story.”. Like, so rude. I just stare at him because of how disrespectful he’s being and i say “i want to take your class, I care about natural resource policy, but I’m going to leave when it ends.” And he said he is gonna work on getting me removed from his class!!!!! IDK WHAT I DID/SAID WRONG??!?! Now i wanna take it out of spite so he has to see me everyday!!! Wtf is wrong with this fool! I did email the dean, and the dean simply replied : “you are allowed to leave whenever you like, but your class ends at 6:45.” And to let him know if i have any more issues. Lol im staying in the class im a senior and i care about this topic i need to know these things im learning.

TLDR; I thrive on schedule but have to legitimately force myself to stick to them. I used these tips to stay on the Dean's List, procrastinate mindfully, stop wasting time on studying ineffectively, and ease the stress of 18 college hours with my 3 homeschooled kids and a job.

-MAKE A WORKSPACE: Make a little area that you keep your school stuff at. Sit there an hour a day to work, make important phone calls, ect. Your ""adulting"" spot. Dont doodle there. Dont eat dinner there. Dont play video games there. Even if it's a backpack, chair, and a tv tray. Mine is a desk in a closet. Decorate meaningfully. A school vision board and an erasable calendar maybe. 

-If you can, take notes on one word document so that you can search your notes instantly for a keyword. 

-MAKE TIME (just a little) to actually work. Everyday. Like a job. Even when you have no work to do, sit down at your desk for a bit every day and find something important to do that is unpleasant/has been put off and do it in that ""work time"". Make that appointment you havent made, call the matenience to fix the dishwasher you have been not using for a week bc you havent called, do whatever and limit the adulting to that hour and do it everyday. You'd be surprised how much an hours of actual work can get done if its consistent. But consistency is hard for me so I have to enforce it. My kids have an hour or so of nap/quiet time in their rooms while I work, and I rarely if ever need more time than that. Most of the time I spend outside of that is on important tests that cant be interrupted. 

-RITUALS: No not those. But you cant just sit down and expect to switch gears. Do something everytime you sit down to work that gets you ""in the zone."" Maybe it's a cup of water and a journal, or checking your calendar or whatever, or even a cigarette and 20 minutes of a game that you only play right before you buckle down, set a timer. Setting out 15 minutes  or so to sit at my desk and bullshit actually makes me work better. 

-ONLY HIGHLIGHT key words in notes and textbooks. If the course has many dates and names, consider highlighting those in a seperate color.

- COMBINE POWERPOINTS all the teachers powerpoints she sends out into one giant  PowerPoint that you can search for keywords efficiently.

-COPY AND PASTE all test questions that allow it into ONE master document of test questions for each class: if you can correct the wrong answers after, even better. This takes no time if you do it during the tests, or print screen after you've taken it. Not all classes allow this, though.

-INDEX everything that you cant search easily. If you do it as you go, it's easy but it's hard to get started. 

-  *Leave it for the due date* , if you have to, but not the night it's due. Work in the morning. Trust me. Wake up at the same time everyday. Do something pleasant for a limited time and then work until you're done for the day. Then you can enjoy you're whole day without the clock ticking down to 11:55PM when that quiz is due that you've known about for 2 weeks and havent done. It's going to happen, it always will, but it you do it that morning, you will always feel better. 

- Bring your snack or drink with you and dont get up, if you can manage that.

- totally optional: Bullet journals. Especially for those that love to be creative, hate taking notes, and cant seem to get organized. Everyone loves to be organized and consistent, deep down.",college

I'm 21 and in my senior year of college but I know there's people here that can relate to this in one way or another.

So last semester, in the final weeks of the semester, I had a powerpoint presentation due in my nutrition class. We were all assigned a vitamin and had to make a presentation about this vitamin.

This project was assigned to us on the first day of the semester and I knew this was going to be a quick, easy A, so like every student ever, I said ""meh, I'll do it later."" WELL, later never came but you know what did come? The day of the presentations. So I stroll into this class, 9:30 am, iced coffee in hand, laid back, no concern over anything. The kid (S) next to me (B), leans over and goes

S: How's your presentation look?

B: Ha, what presentation?

S: ...

B: ...

S: ...

S: The presentation that's due today.

Let me just say that my heart has never dropped so low, out my ass, and into the center of the Earth so fast in my life.

B: ...oh shit.

So, my last name starts with A... and the professor (P) goes:

P: Alright, we're gonna start the presentations soon and I'm just gonna go in alphabetical order.

Thank fuck that there were a few people before me that also had last names that started with A. So I I M M E D I A T E L Y open a fresh powerpoint, make a title card, and start Googling like I've never Googled in my life. I pulled up the project rubric in a small window on my laptop and I literally just started copying and pasting every question that was required to be in the presentation.

I literally made a decent looking in 10 minutes and long story short, I got an A somehow. I somehow got an A on the most rushed piece of a shit thing I have ever produced in my academic career. It was so hard for me not to laugh while I was presenting and S was sitting there giggling his ass off cause he knew what I had done and that he had saved my ass.

But yeah, don't procrastinate, set reminders, keep a planner, use a calendar, something.

213,1698422167.0,my class has an absolutely ridiculous attendance policy,"Someone please try to understand the logic of this attendance policy. Now my class has lecture twice a week and a discussion section once a week. We have an attendance grade that's worth 10% of our grade for lecture and an attendance/participation grade worth 20% for our discussion classes. 

Now in the syllabus it states that every absence from class results in a 10% grade deduction of your overall grade. That seemed completely illogical because whats the point of an attendance grade if you get docked a whole letter grade for missing class anyways right? So I went ahead and asked one of the TAs about that at the beginning of the semester and they told me that that policy only applies to our discussion sections which made sense to me. 

Now midway through the semester after I've already missed countless lectures but 0 discussion classes, I'm being told that the policy applies to lectures as well......

Whats the point of an attendance grade if you're losing a whole ass letter grade for missing class anyways?!?!?!

Edit: After some backlash, I wanted to clarify some things. I asked a TA about this policy **before** I started missing classes, and they explicitly told me that it did not apply to lectures. I also asked a separate TA a few weeks into class to double check, and they told me the same thing.

218,1594857840.0,Some Incoming Freshman Tips That I Wish Someone Had Told Me,"1.) Make your room cozy (if you want). Even putting a few posters on the wall will make a world of difference. Also, LED lights were the best (non-essential) $20 I spent all year, highly recommend.

2.) You know what kind of person you are. By this I mean, if you want your room to be cute and decorated, don't let someone convince you that it's a waste of money/time. I loved having a cozy room to come back to and made lots of friends due to them wanting to hang out in my room.

3.) This also means you know what you use. Don't bring a water bottle if you never use one now. Don't bring that piece of clothing you haven't worn in months because it will just take up space.

4.) Keep the pandemic situation in mind. You probably don't need to pack swim suites because pools won't be open anyways. Also, stuff like a printer may not be as necessary as most classes will turn things in digitally (unless you need it to scan things)

5.) Also with the pandemic in mind, pack lightly and keep containers in your room. You want to be able to move out at a moments notice if things get really bad again.

6.) You will need a lot less clothes than you think you do but will probably overpack anyways. If you haven't worn something by the time you go home for your first break, take it home with you.

7.) If drinking/smoking isn't your thing, don't worry! There are plenty of people who choose not to for whatever reason and most people are respectful of this.

8.) If you do go out partying, you leave and come back with the same people. You make sure everyone got home safe and sound (especially the girls in your group). Don't let your girl friends walk alone at night.

9.) Probably an unpopular opinion but don't be afraid to cut your friends off if they've had too much. It's not cool to pressure someone into drinking more than their bodies can handle. Look out for all of your friends and if they don't do that for you, find new friends.

10.) If someone passes out from drinking, *PLEASE* roll them onto their side. Lots of people die every year from choking on vomit while unconscious.

11.) This may be obvious, but try your best in classes and put them above all else. You pay so much money, to do otherwise would be silly. I say this as someone who partied A LOT and still had straight A's, it's important you find a balance.

12.) Bring a basic first aid kit and some basic OTC medicine. I was very happy to have fever reducer and ibuprofen on standby when I got tonsillitis a month into school.

13.) Lots of people say a TV is a waste but we used ours a lot. Especially with the pandemic happening, you should expect to be inside a lot more anyways. (Same goes for PC set ups)

14.) You'll soon learn that people weren't raised the same as you. Set guidelines with your roommates about cleaning/partying/bringing people over ect. during the first couple days of school. Also, bring up issues with your roommates as soon as they're on your radar.

15.) Be safe if you're hooking up. Let a friend/roommate know where you're going, I found using snap location made me feel safer. Also wrap it up!

16.) Some stuff that I brought that was never used included: Ear plugs, desk lamp, paper clips, post its, water bottle, swimsuit. It all depends on the person though. Ear plugs are good to bring just in case, better to have and not need than to never have them at all.

17.) If you have a car on campus, maybe keep that low key unless you want people asking for rides all the time.

18.) Be safe. Wear a mask outside your dorm at all times. To not do this is so selfish and you're not only endangering yourself, but those around you and everyone they come into contact with. Maybe you would be fine if you got covid, but the asthmatic kid down the hall may not be so lucky. You are not invincible and life will soon show you otherwise if you think that.

19.) Have fun! The 7 months I was on campus last year were the best of my life. I've made so many life long friends and I hope you will too.

234,1695917664.0,People keep on sitting in my reserved seating even though there is a very clear sign saying that it is reserved and during what time. What should I do?,"So I have disability accommodations for preferential seating. Every semester I email student disabilities at my UNI and tell them which seat in which lecture hall that I would like (usually one in the back and near the door), and they put a label on that seat that very clearly states that it is reserved during that class and for that time period. 

In past semesters I haven't had much of an issue with others sitting in my spot since I get to my classes very early, but for this particular class, I have to arrive only about 5-10 minutes before lectures start since I have another class that ends right before. There is almost always another person sitting in my spot by then, however. Because my disability isn't visible, people look at me funny when I explain to them that I have that seat reserved and act annoyed when I ask them to move, if they move at all. And as a note, I am the only person who had that seat reserved, so it's not like I'm kicking them out of their seat. Our lecture isn't jam packed either and there are often many other seats for them to sit at. 

I've spoken with my professor and student disabilities and there isn't much they can do about it.

I tried to send in my hand-written outline to the teacher, but she refused to take it.

What had me most upset was that the prof saw the AI similarity score on the draft as well and didn't even talk to me about it. I just don't think it's very fair to give me the ok to keep going with my draft if it had a false positive too.

I'm actively redoing this next essay because I'm genuinely afraid that it will get flagged too. If I get another false positive, there's a good chance I'll lose my scholarship.

245,1595043120.0,Safety Tips for college women,"I am reposting from a list made by girls at my school. 

1. Share location with good friends. I understand you don’t want your parents tracking you but it is a good idea for your friends to know where you are or your last location in the event you go missing or need help sent to you. If you have a date that night let someone know. 

2. Be very cautious when meeting anyone from online for the first time including tinder, bumble etc. when meeting someone for the first time meet them in public or in your housing. Do not go alone to a strangers house. You could be assaulted by the person your meeting or worse walk into a set up. 

3. Have your own alcohol (I would include drugs in this too) Do not take random drinks from anyone including other women. Bring your own alcohol to parties or stick to sealed beverages such as cans or drinks being served to everyone such as beer from a keg. Avoid any random concoctions. 

4. Drink among friends. Do not go out alone always have at least one friend with you. Be aware of each other’s where abouts throughout the party. 

5. Make sure everyone is accounted for. Everyone who came together leaves together. (I personally have seen this problem happen) While going out in a large group of friends may seem safer but it is not. The more girls, the easier it is to lose someone without realizing. If two girls go out they are unlikely to leave each other during the party and you would notice immediately if the only person you know is missing. In a group of friends it can be easy to lose someone because of diffusion of responsibly, everyone is talking to someone else, someone must know where she is mentality. It is easy to lose one girl when party or bar hopping throughout the night in a group. Keep track of your friends. 

6. Do not go to the bathroom alone. (I personally know of a girl who was followed into a bathroom and raped while at a house party) This one is more so for house parties than bars as bar bathrooms aren’t single stall so many women are in there at once also bar staff tends to keep an eye on bathrooms for all sorts of reasons. Bring a friend into the bathroom with you or at least to stand outside. It is very easy at a party for a predator to follow a girl into a bathroom and for bystanders to assume they are a couple looking for privacy. Never use a bathroom in a secluded part of the house alone.  If you are followed into a bathroom scream your head off for help. People will care I promise. 

7. Make sure your phone is charged before you go anywhere. You do not want to be in a situation where you are unable to call 911 or a friend or an Uber. Keep your phone on you as much as possible. 

8. Always have a healthy level of caution in a professional or educational setting. Meet professors before class instead of after. Schedule one on one meetings in less secluded places if the option is given to you. Such as meeting a tutor in a library instead of dorm room. Bring a friend along if the matter is not confidential when meeting a professor or other college staff member. 

9. Have a healthy level of caution among friends. Predators are stereotyped as strangers who hide in bushes but many sex crimes are committed by a person who knows the victim such as a friend of a friend, friends boyfriend or brother or even a friend themself. Be careful where you sleep. Always sleep in your own bed whenever possible. Do not sleep on a friends couch in a house with many people in the house. 
Be selective about who sleeps in your house as well. 

10. Just because someone attends the same school as you does not mean you “know them”. Many girls who would never dream going back to a strangers house think it’s safe to go back to the room or house of someone they just met simply because they are also a student at that school. This person is still a stranger. 

11. Other women are not always friends. (This one applies mostly to sex trafficking and abductions) Many girls are lured by other women into being victimized. Predators are often smart and realize women are much less suspicious of other women. Be wary of anyone who randomly approaches you with a “job offer” like modeling or photography. A random woman in social media trying to get you to meet her somewhere is another one. 

12. Stay away from the worst. In college do not let a little youthful rebellion or college partying make you think there is anything glamorous about a life of crime. You may feel invincible but you are not. There is a very big difference between college kids experimenting with drugs or making fake ids and being a career criminal. Practice good common sense. College aged women are very vulnerable to being manipulated into sex work by drug addict boyfriends or pimps. College is a time for taking risks and having fun but do not take it too far. 

13. Educate yourself on the signs and behaviors of an abusive boyfriend. This will allow you to educate yourself before potentially entering an abusive relationship that will ruin your college years.

14. Do not go home with anyone you met that night. You can give your phone number and agree to meet another day. If you really want to see more of them that night bring them back to your housing. This will you to be in control of the situation and your safety. If they refuse to go to your housing instead of theirs that is a major read flag. Going home with a stranger after drinking leaves you vulnerable to many potential problems or high risk behaviors. Ranging from assault from the person you went home with or his roommates, to impulsive consensual unprotected sex.

15. If you see something not right happening get involved. Be a friend to a girl who needs it. Do not let your school be a place where violence against women is tolerated.",college

252,1604185290.0,Stop Self-Sabotaging Because You are Capable.,"Fellow students,

I know it's so easy to procrastinate, to push your work aside and cram in the very last minute. You tell yourself that you'll work on it after watching an episode of your show, or after taking a nap because you're too exhausted to start this assignment. After hours of putting off your work, you finally decide to open your laptop and start. You click on the assignment and 5 minutes later you find yourself on your phone, distracted once again. 

I just wanted to remind you that you are completely capable of acing your classes, of earning the grades you'll be happy with. All it takes is a conscious effort to complete your assignments and set aside time for your studies. 

Procrastination stems from fear, and the key is to do your work despite *feeling* like you want to procrastinate. There is no physical barrier between you and your assignments, it's all mental. So, ground yourself, stop the self sabotaging, and get it done. You’ll feel awesome and accomplished and still have time to do everything else you like. Nothing is above you, nothing is too difficult for you, and you are more than capable of being *that* student.

At this time of year, there seem to be lots of posts about asking to raise your grades.

Please take the initiative to let me know early in the semester if this is a serious problem for you, and I can refer you to that office. In addition to the special fund, I can also see if the publisher will provide you with a free copy of the textbook, which they've been known to do - particularly if our school is a good customer of theirs. Or I may have an old copy of the textbook that I can lend or possibly even give you. No guarantees that I can help, but it can't hurt to ask.

For example my friend who is a nursing student literally have 12 hour internships at a hospital and she still manages to stay focused, and when she gets back to home she still has the energy to study and read a book/whatever. How is this possible with all the sources online telling you thag you should AT LEAST get 7 hours of sleep, and 8 is even better?

Edit: don't you all realize that the people who 5 hours are enough for them, also happen to be college students/workers who are forced to wake up before 8 am? While the people that can sleep as much as they want sleep 8-10 hours? My theory is that your body can adapt to as little as 5 hours of sleep or even better, that amount of sleep is just as fine as 8 hours. That's the only thing that would make sense evidently.",college

276,1675704461.0,PSA!! Start saving your drafts when writing to avoid accusations of AI cheating.,"I've been stumbling across more and more posts of students getting zeroes for writing their own papers. Every day more and more professors are incorporating programs into their grading to detect writing styles similar to Chat GPT, meaning that professors are no longer grading their work by themselves, but instead with the helping hand of an unreliable and inaccurate software. 

That being said, SAVE YOUR DRAFTS! Especially with large essay assignments, you should start savings proof! Your grade is YOURS, and the last thing we should be doing as students is giving our professors the power to discredit our hard work on the basis of internet tools they aren't willing to understand, without any ways of defending ourselves. 

These detectors aren't going anywhere. In fact, they're likely to go even more mainstream, and soon will be affecting  the whole industry. Don't let your professors hold that power over you, because these situations can happen to you, and I want you all to be able to save your grades.

279,1692588791.0,"My professor falsely accused me on cheating, failed me for the class, and reported me to the college board for academic dishonesty. Advice?","I am in my final quarter at a community college, and I am admitted to a large university in fall quarter this year and was accepted to my major. My acceptance to the program was contingent upon the completion of one final course, so I was taking the course this summer and was to send my final transcript over once final grades had been posted. Everything was going well, I had a 96% in the class, and submitted my final assignment this Tuesday. 

I check my email today and see that my professor gave me a 0 on the final project, which brought my grade down to a failing grade as it accounted for 40% of our total grade. The only feedback she gave was ""You are not allowed to use outside resources and AI generated responses"". I absolutely DID NOT use AI or use any outside resources. The assignment was computational and I showed my work. The only resources I used were notes that I had taken throughout the quarter, most of which were directly paraphrased from her lectures. She gave no rubric for the final project and I don't even understand how she could have extrapolated me using ChatGPT for a math project? 

I am absolutely shocked and I feel so upset. She reported it to the college board which means this will be on my record and I am extremely afraid that my acceptance to the university will be rescinded/revoked. I have worked so, so hard for the past 3 years and I have never once been accused of cheating or anything of the sort. Has anyone every experienced something like this before? What do I do? 

Tl;dr: My professor falsely accused me of cheating/using chatgpt on a computation project and reported me to the college board for academic dishonesty. I am supposed to be transferring to a 4 yr university this fall and I am so scared I will get kicked out. WTF do I do??!

UPDATE: I emailed her and we are speaking tomorrow. I am scared because i know she’s going to ask to see the version history, but the issue is that I work on google docs and convert to word doc to submit because she only accepts word files. The word doc doesn’t have an edit history because of this, and the file is completely gone from google docs and I cannot recover it seemingly. Fuuuuuu*k me! Thanks for all the support and advice guys!

UPDATE 2: Alright so i met with my professor. I don’t know why I was anticipating her to be more understanding of this whole situation, but she was extremely accusatory and confrontational seeming that she was 100% certain that I had cheated. Her explanation was that I used a method to solve an equation that she allegedly never showed us, therefore I must have looked it up or had a bot complete the problem for me. I proceeded to tell her that in one of her lectures that she shared (pre recorded from seven years ago, she hasn’t updated anything since), she mentioned this method as one of three acceptable methods of solving the problem. So for the whole quarter, i had been using this method. I even found the video clip of her referencing this method. She back tracked and said that she never provided the specific template for this method, so i must have had to look it up. I showed her that I found the template from the assigned textbook. Then, she proceeded to ask me other impromptu exam questions for me to solve on the spot which I could not do because this is an intro level class and I am not yet equipped to solve these philosophical math questions on a whim. While i tried to answer these questions, she made mocking/confused faces at me.

Once she had prodded me about everything, I simply asked her if she was going to proceed with reporting this to the school board. She said she would not do this, but there were numerous other students that made the same mistake (?) as me that she will be reporting. She did not fix the grade, but will all my completed work, i rounded out to a C and i am okay with that as long as I do not have academic dishonesty on my record. Once the conversation was over, i tried to politely thank her for her time and understanding and she responded “yep, bye” and signed off the meeting. 

All in all, very strange experience that i was so not expecting. So glad it is taken care of. Thanks to everyone for your advice and kindness! Hope this situation doesn’t affect any of you for the remainder of your college years.",college
280,1605147608.0,Professor gave me a 0 on a test for emailing her a question.,"I was taking an exam for a resourcing class which was open book. I had put the wrong choice for a question and wanted to change it however, the test did not allow back tracking so I took a screenshot of the question I had put wrong and emailed the professor after the exam asking if I could change the answer to this question. 

After some time, my professor emailed me saying I was given a 0 for taking a screenshot of the question and being on an electronic device.

This makes the class extremely difficult for me to pass as I need a 100 on the final exam and 100 on all other assignments now to pass with a 70 average for the class. 

I am confused on why I was given a 0. The test was online and open book so I would have to be using my computer. I took a screenshot for her to know which question I was referring to. I can’t cheat because it’s an open book test. If I was cheating I wouldn’t be dumb enough to have went to the professor.

282,1606235453.0,Here's what might happen to you if you get caught cheating,"Well, I never thought this would happen but it did. As we all know, online courses have been a mess this semester. In particular my chemistry class has been hell. Our average test scores are 20%-30%. I usually get lower, and chemistry has never been my strong suit. 

Since this is reddit, im not going to lie. On our 3rd exam last week I was having trouble with a few questions. Our tests are technically open note, but I went to the one place that is usually off limits: chegg. I searched some questions and some people had clearly copied and pasted the exam questions to chegg, and received answers. To my credit I did look at the explanation of questions and figured out how the answer became to be, but ultimately I did see the answer and therefore put that answer into my exam. 

Yesterday my professor sent an email about how people posted the exam questions on chegg and how my schools Dean Of Students would be contacting chegg to request who posted the questions AND who accessed the questions. He mentioned how the penalties will be lesser if those who cheated came forward on their own. So I did. 

Because I came forward and its my first offense, my punishments include a 0 on the exam, have to take an online academic integrity course, and get an official report filed at the Dean of Students just to have it on record in case I offend again. The real part that sucks? I work within the Dean of students which makes this 10x more embarrassing. Im pretty sure nothing will happen to my employment, but there's still a worry in the back of my mind. 

I never thought about using chegg to be honest. All of my roommates use it even on exams and a lot of other people in my class cheated on this exam as well. Its so common I didn't think anything would happen. But it did and its my mistake and I take the consequences. 

Basically. I want this to be a warning. I've learned a huge lesson, and I deactivated my chegg account. Id rather get a C in the class vs getting suspended from my university. Even though my punishments can be seen as mild, it certainly wasn't worth it.

Edit: there are people calling me dumb and an idiot in the comments because they believe my professor tricked us into confessing. I dont know exactly what to believe, because on cheggs policy they say they can and will give out extensive information on who accessed certain questions, meanwhile threads on r/professor say differently. The point is no matter if I was baited or not, I learned my lesson from looking at chegg and won't be doing it again. I find it takes my integrity to admit mistakes then try to get away with everything. Sometimes its just better to receive the necessary punishment and learn for the future.

Also, everyone is asking why on earth id use my real name on my account. I did so because I truly didn't start my chegg account to cheat, and when I looked at questions during the exam I wasn't even thinking about it because its so common to use chegg. Yes it would have been smarter to not use my name, but understand that I didn't start my chegg account with the direct attention to cheat.",college

But since Covid, I've joined this subreddit because I want to know what's going on with students' mental health, but don't want my students to feel weirded out if I ask.

What I've learned is that a lot of you are Not Doing Okay.   And that Covid-19 and online learning is really, really stressing you out.   And I'm sorry that I don't have any good answers for that.

But the other thing I see is people struggling on how to study in college, which is so different from studying in High School.

Unfortunately, a lot of students are missing out on the very thing that would help you out.  **I'm NOT SAYING THIS BECAUSE IT'S WHAT I THINK, I'M SAYING THIS BECAUSE THIS IS THE F\*\*KING SCIENCE.**

There have been SOOOO many epistemological studies about easy things you can change regarding note-taking that will literally improve your grades, your exams, and your general understanding.

Some of you will know all of this already.  But note-taking isn't just something we're born knowing how to do and bugs the hell out of me that no one bothers to ever teach it.

So for those who don't know what are essentially ""study hacks"", here's the science:

# #1) TAKING NOTES BY HAND AUTOMATICALLY STICKS INSIDE YOUR MEMORY MORE THAN TAKING NOTES ON A LAPTOP DOES, EVEN IF YOU NEVER LOOK AT YOUR NOTES AGAIN.

(Link to the study: [https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/sites.udel.edu/dist/6/132/files/2010/11/Psychological-Science-2014-Mueller-0956797614524581-1u0h0yu.pdf](https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/sites.udel.edu/dist/6/132/files/2010/11/Psychological-Science-2014-Mueller-0956797614524581-1u0h0yu.pdf) )

When it comes to remembering facts, like ""When did the civil war start?"" there wasn't much of a difference.  

However, when it comes down to understanding the CONCEPTS, students who wrote longhand did unbelievably better.  As in three times better.   If you want to know why they did so much better, go to hack #2.

# #2) USING YOUR OWN WORDS TO WRITE DOWN NOTES IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN WRITING DOWN EXACTLY WHAT THE PROFESSOR SAYS IN THE LECTURE.

Directly from the study: ""Overall, p**articipants who took more notes performed better whether or notebook or laptop,** β = 0.34, p = .023, partial R2 = .08. ***However, those whose notes had less verbatim overlap with the lecture performed \[even\] better,*** β = −0.43, p = .005, partial R2 = .12  


For instance, if the prof's slide says: 

`""Psychologists have investigated a phenomenon known as “attitude inoculation,” which works on the same principle as vaccination, and involves exposing people to weak arguments against a viewpoint they hold.""`  


Don't write that down verbatim.  Write down what it \*means\* and in your own words.  Something like:

`If you challenge someone's opinion with weak arguments, but a lot of them, they'll actually double-down on their opinion`

Or, for real shorthand, fast

`Lots of weak arguments = they'll double down`

So long as you can tell what that means.

# #3) VISUALS HELP

Draw whatever helps you understand the concept, be it graphs or maps or whatever.   Such as:  


WATCH THIS VIDEO:  

It's from a guy that scored 99.9th percentile in his med school classes, and he attributes it to his note-taking skills:

&#x200B;

# #4) HERE'S THE BIG BIG BIG BIG HACK THAT WILL SAVE YOU THE MOST TIME:

Review your notes within twenty-four hours.  This can save you hours of extra studying in the long run.

Make sure it's within 24 hours though!   Science isn't 100% sure why it has to be done within that time frame, but it could be because of (theoretical but certainly not debunked) ""neural dumping.""  Basically, this means as you sleep at night your brain shits out all the information that is non-essential.

Guess what's non-essential:  calculus.  history.  English lit.     Sure, not to you, but to your brain?  It says, ""F\*\*k it, we need the space.  Get rid of this crap.""

Let me know if any of this is helpful, or if it's just mostly annoying stuff that you already know.

Take care guys.  It's only 4 years of hell, I promise.  After that, it's only 40 more years of hell in the workforce, but at least it's a different kind of hell.

Neither of us wanted any sort of relationship, however I still thought she would tell me if she was also sleeping with other people. 

Am I just naive and innocent? Even though I am somewhat okay with casual sex, I still believe in respecting each other and letting them know when you’re gonna be with other people. Is this not thing?

I packed up quietly and tried to leave quickly, but my professor stopped lecturing and asked if I was leaving, to which I said yes and that I was sorry. She responded that she was 'sorry,' too and turned to the class to tell them that we need to inform her beforehand if we need to leave class early. 

I left class pretty much exactly five minutes earlier than it usually ends, too. I feel really uncomfortable and embarrassed by this whole thing. I've never left her class early before and I have a good grade in her class. Should I email her about this or just move on?

EDIT:
I did end up emailing her and let her know what the issue was and apologized if I caused any disruption. Her response was short and basically just, ‘okay thanks for the message… sorry that you had an emergency.’

315,1583969193.0,Some tips for online classes,"I saw a lot of stuff on r/college lately from students who have not taken online classes before. Since I teach both online and face-to-face (and have for some time) I thought I'd share some of the tips (and other considerations) with regard to online classes.

Tips:

1. First and foremost, it is WAY easier to skip the work when it's online. I plan on having asynchronous lectures for my switch over to online, but even for those faculty hosting live lectures, it will be much tougher to focus. Try to set up an environment where you can stay focused. Wear actual clothes, get your coffee, act like you would if you were in a face-to-face class so your brain doesn't try to switch into ""relax"" mode on you. Try to watch the videos/lectures around the same time your class would have met since you are already in the routine for it.

2. Take notes like you would in a regular class. Again, when it's online (especially recorded) it might feel silly to take notes. But notes help you learn, face-to-face or otherwise.

3. PARTICIPATE! You will not get to hear other students' questions as much (if at all, depending on the format). There is not really an easy way to do discussions so the more you make an effort to participate, the more everyone will get out of it. If you have questions on the material, for the love of God make sure you ask them because no one else is going to ask them for you as often happens in traditional classes.

4. Exams are probably going to be different. You might get a prof that just throws the multiple choice exam online, but most are aware that it is so easy to cheat online that they will format online exams differently. You will see lots more randomization of questions, question order, and answer choice order. You might see online proctor services like Lockdown Browser or Respondus Monitor that literally lock you out of everything but the exam and then record you taking it via webcam. You might end up getting an open book exam that is much more difficult.

5. Usually, you'd be in class about 2.5 hours a week and (hopefully) studying and doing some assignments on top of that. You should keep with that pattern. Assume it'll take you ~2.5 hours just to go through all the learning content. I think a lot of students just erase the class time from their brain and try to just rush through everything, which would not be possible in a face-to-face. This is another way that setting up a ""class time"" for yourself can really help.

6. Editing to add this one: Every prof is going to do this differently. Some might livestream lectures, some might record them, some might not lecture at all. It is really important you keep an eye on your emails, check your notification settings on Canvas/Blackboard/whatever, and get comfortable with 4 or 5 slightly different versions of this.

The best way I can sum this up is that in a traditional class you are often or at least often can get away with being a passive consumer of the content. In an online class you have to be more of an active participant in your own learning. 

Other considerations:

1. Many--MANY--of your professors hate teaching online and have no idea how to do it right. They have never had to before. It is not as simple or easy as it might seem to design a good online learning experience and many faculty have no experience with it and no time to learn. We are all dealing with this change, so try to be patient the best you can. 

2. Be open-minded. I teach a topic that can be put online pretty easily, but I have no clue how you would put a chem lab or an acting class online. And neither do a lot of faculty. This will be testing the creativity of many professors. Every course has learning objectives you are expected to be assessed on, and they will have to find a way to do that.

3. Technical issues are going to be rampant, both because of the pressure put on the learning management systems and because of instructor incompetence + poor user interfaces. Don't start stuff at the last minute. It's not a good idea in general but you run the risk of technical issues preventing you from finishing. Your professors are not tech support either and chances are they have no clue what's wrong. You should probably contact your campus tech support folks for help, not your professor, unless you're sure it's something wrong on their end.

4. Editing to add: Everything is going to be just fine. It's going to be weird. It's going to be an adjustment. But ultimately if you pay attention to your profs and keep up with the work this will just have been an inconvenience in the end.

I'm sure others can chime in with more suggestions or comments. Good luck with the transition.",college
316,1681004530.0,PSA: Choose the better professor over the better class time,"Maybe you needed to hear this from someone. ***If you can***, always choose the better professor over the better class time. The professor doesn't have reviews on ratemyprofessor? The professor's ratemyprofessor reviews are only from 10+ years ago? Try not to risk it; if you heard good things about a certain professor (from upperclassmen ESPECIALLY or cross-referencing ratemyprofessor reviews with your school's internal review system), TAKE THEM. When the time comes, you'll be thinking about how your professor sucks and your friend taking the same class with a different professor at a different time is basically chilling, and it's just not worth taking the class at an better time for such a shitty ass prof.

318,1701165065.0,Shooting on Campus,"Writing this at 5am since there’s no way i’m going back to sleep. At 3am this morning I woke up to the fire alarm going off in my residential hall building. Me, and the remainder of my suite mates and those on my hall, left though the emergency exit closest to us. After standing outside for about 5-10 minutes several gunshots were heard maybe a couple 100 feet away and everyone began running back inside in a mass panic. With the fire alarm still blaring and an active shooter on campus my suite mates and I all sat on the floor in the safest area of out apartment. For the next 2 hours we all remained hidden in our rooms while police scanned the area and eventually cornered the suspect on an area of campus. One more gunshot was heard shortly before we received an alert the suspect and their gun was apprehended and there was no longer a threat on campus. 

Something of note is that there are rumors that the fire alarm in our building was purposefully set off.

Another thing is that the emergency exit my hall leaves the building out of usually stays propped open so we can all get back in the building faster and is our fasted route to safety. Shortly before the gunshots and man in a black hoodie came up and slammed the door closed and the quickly walked away behind the building.

To provide some context:  The class is actually online, and our presentations were scheduled during a Zoom meeting. Our professor gave us the flexibility to divide the work however we saw fit, even allowing just one person to present if that's what we decided.

I had a midterm at 6pm, and our class runs from 5:30 to 7pm. I let my group know about this conflict in advance, and we agreed that I'd handle the entire PowerPoint while the other two would do the presenting.

340,1653569320.0,I think my professor died and I don't know what to do.,"This class is a completely remote late start class. There are no scheduled Zoom meetings and all lectures are prerecorded. Everyday since the course began my professor sends out a message via the class Chat feature about some obscure holiday, his dog, or a sports game; until last week. At the start of the course, he informed us he had COVID, so I'm a bit worried. However, there was recently a group of students who asked him to stop with his daily Chat messages as it clouds up their emails. The day my classmates did this was also the last time my professor sent out a message (two hours prior to the message my classmates sent) so I feel like he might have gone silent as per their wishes. Still, he hasn't uploaded our final exam to the Module, or graded the last test we took. As far as I can tell, its just him and his elderly dog. 


Assuming the worst, what do I do? Who do I contact?

Edit: Another classmate and I messaged/emailed our professor a few hours before I posted this.

Update: A classmate said she emailed our professor a few days ago and has not gotten a response. Another classmate has informed us that he has reached out to the department head.

Update 2: Another classmate left a voicemail with the Dean's assistant earlier today. She got a response from HR letting her know that the Dean has been in contact with our professor, who is seemingly having technical issues. Looks like we weren't the only ones having trouble reaching him. We're expected to get ""more information regarding this course tomorrow or ASAP"". I will post another update when I hear from the Dean or the professor.

Update 3: I received an email from the Department Head just a few hour ago, she says our professor is fine and working to resolve the technical issues. In all honesty, I don't buy it. It has been nearly two weeks since we heard from our professor and he would have realized immediately that there was a problem. Finals are this week, and I would've expect the school to have resolved the issue by now. I think the school knows he passed and doesn't want to tell us until after final exams are over. I hope this isn't the case, but we aren't being given much information. In any case, I'll post another update when I hear from my professor or the Department staff.

Update 4: I just finished taking the final for this class. I'm still unsure if it is the professor who uploaded it since the format wasn't given in its usual manner. My writing assignment has been graded, but the rubric is straight forward enough anyone can grade it. Our last test has not been graded and this test does require knowledge of the course to grade properly. There still hasn't been a response to my message from the professor yet. I plan to keep in contact with him over the summer to make sure he's ok. I'll post my final update when grades have been submitted, when I get a response to my message, or the school contacts me.

Final update: My professor finally responded. He is ""frighteningly ill"" and was locked out of his iPhone. I think he forgot his password to Canvas, which was more than likely stored in his phone. He has resumed his obscure national holiday messages (yesterday was National Smile day if you're curious). Thank you for all the suggestions on how to reach out to the staff.",college

And I don't want to blame mental illness as a *cause* for me falling behind, but it definitely predisposes me to higher stress and makes burnout so much harder to avoid.

Does this happen to you? Is there any actual benefit to reaching out to your professors to tell them you're ""struggling,"" even if your grades don't reflect that?

edit: I just opened this thread again a day after posting it. I didn't expect such an outpouring of support and solidarity. I can't reply to everyone, but thank you all so much for your input and I'm really relieved to hear that I'm not the only one going through this! ",college
345,1543162718.0,Does anyone else get discouraged when people who cheat on everything and learn nothing make better grades than those who put the work in?,"I know I am furious about it. I used to never care if people cheated, but a classmate made a comment that sent me over the edge. I should mention I am nervous as hell this time of year because I need to maintain my GPA to stay eligible for classes. So I take my grades super seriously lately. 

But there are a few people who blatantly cheat on everything and never learned a single thing all semester except how to say 'no comprendo' to every single question (I'm talking about a Spanish class) and then laugh about it with their group. Those guys also all have A's. 

One guy mentioned to me that he bets I have a high grade if he can get a 90% for the class. I was instantly furious because my average is less than a 80 even though I bend over backwards for that class and need the B to stay in school. 

Is it normal for people to get discouraged like that? You freak out over this class yet someone else barely remembers they're in it and they are the one with the better grade. I'm really not sure how to feel or if I should bring it up with the professor. ",college

347,1704597441.0,Is my professor allowed to do this?,"Context: 

I have a professor who teaches 2 classes back to back that are required for my minor. I just took the first this past semester and I’m about to take the second this upcoming semester. The class is small (30ish people) and all but 2 people who took the class last semester are taking the one next semester. 

The professor has zero work-life balance and struggles staying professional both in and out of the classroom. She’s also not from the country I go to school in, and usually she falls on that excuse when someone criticizes her behavior.

My issue:

On the first day of class, she made us sign up for a texting app, Pronto in order to communicate with us outside of class instead of using email. She has completely abused the this app, demanding near constant communication from me and my classmates. She would often text us at (or even after) 11pm asking us to watch 20+ minute long videos and send paragraphs on what we thought of them. If we don’t respond by our 9am class she would deduct points and yell at everyone, including the people who did do it. 

I was trying to keep my head down and just suffer through the class because she is the only professor that teaches it and I need the credits for my minor. I don’t think I can just do that anymore. 

Today she sent us an assignment that will take minimum of 20 hours and demanded we have it done by next week. The semester doesn’t start until 2.5 weeks from now. I refuse to do an assignment during my break for a class I’m not even in yet, and I’m not sure how much patience I have for this behavior next semester. 

Several classmates of mine, including myself, are planning to write a formal complaint to the department. I’m pretty sure we have a leg to stand on, but I just wanted to double check with yall before I attach my name on this email. 

Thus, given this information, do we have the right to complain? 

If yall have any other advice, I am happy to listen too! Thank you for reading all this.

UPDATE:

I’ll keep it short and sweet, but basically we tried to work it out with her and she claimed that she had every right to assign work since “its hardly a new class” (????). Anyway, that email got forwarded to the department head and the assignment was promptly shut down. 

Also many of you were right, Pronto is not approved by the school and violates IT stuff. Not sure what they’re gonna do with her, but thank you guys so much for the support and advice!!

If any of you are reading this because your prof did something similar, I just found out that most universities have a “grace period” where the prof can’t assign work. My university’s grace period is 48 hours after 8am of the semester start. Basically it’s just so we can all buy books and stuff before getting assignments.",college
348,1695131861.0,College making my nephew retake a class he passed because the prof entered wrong grade.,"I'm looking for some advice on how to go about getting this changed. My nephew Took a typing class. Did all the work, showed up to all the classes. And should have received an A. However, the professor entered an F instead and promised my nephew he would change it. That was last semester. Now the school is telling him he needs to retake the class  to cancel out the F. I have a HUGE problem with this for obvious reasons and it seems scammy. If I can't get help from the prof or my nephews academic advisor what would be your next step? My nephew is even saying the dean isn't helping either.

Update*** The class wasn't ""Typing"". It was a freshman Microsoft 365 skills course to make sure incoming students are aware of how all the applications work and how to use them efficiently. I just asked my nephew for the course description. My nephew has shown me the email from his prof confirming a grade of A and a pending change. Additionally the school doesn't avg in the retake class grade they replace the original for GPA purposes.",college

This is very different from high school. I used to excel at school without the need to study much. Now I'm studying 24/7 and it's draining my life energy away. I've fallen into depression and I haven't left my house in weeks now. Because of the online classes, I don't know anybody in classes and I'm staring at my screen all day. (my textbooks are all online). My eyes are deteriorating at a quick rate. It's the first time in my life that I'm doing all-nighters. I've been having mental breakdowns often.

352,1598630662.0,80% of my online class is just discussion posts,"I was just emailed the syllabus and saw that it’s on a point system where discussion posts are basically the entire grade. There’s a final essay at the end but that’s all. 

In the discussion posts, we have to write a 2/3 page paper and a 2 page response to a student. We also have to cite from the textbook and outside sources. We also aren’t allowed to say the usual “I agree, I disagree,” etc. 

I know this doesn’t seem like a lot, but there is nothing I dread more than a discussion post. Anything this is that I’m used to only ever really writing 1/2 paragraphs when doing discussion posts.

353,1625229604.0,"As an older person attending college, I find the content to be condescending to young people.","I’m 43. I returned to school to get a degree. I’m ending my final semester, and I’m taking all the stupid gen-Ed classes like public speaking, English, stats, etc. 

Every assignment in every class, when it can, is seriously condescending to young people. 

In my stats class, we had to do these dumb “Academic Habits” assignments once a week, where we watch a video on mental health, social media usage, having a “growth mindset” etc. The main theme overall is “put your phone down and go outside”. Our signature assignment in stats was interpreting 3 data sets about “social media usage”

In English, I have written 2 papers that included some sort of social media propaganda. One was a presentation about “teen mental health”, citing social media as a huge factor. The other was about “using social media in a constructive way”. 

What the fuck. College students are adults. Can we stop patronizing them about phones?? 

I was so disappointed in the statistics signature assignment. We spent all semester doing complex math and interpreting data. I finally learned how to do this all stuff and I thought maybe I could really apply it to a data set of my choosing, or look at some interesting statistics. But no, more Boomer propaganda shoved down my throat. 

I get that social media can be a problem for young people, and I understand that young people are struggling with mental health but can we challenge them with some interested material instead of reminding them constantly? 

Has anyone else had this experience or is it just my CC?

EDIT: I understand that the topic of social media usage is important, but do we have to make every assignment about it in every class? Social media usage is an exhausted topic in the media, at home, in high school etc. I have teenagers who I know have been listening to adults drone on and on about social media for most of their life. I want young people to get excited about other topics. It’s just my opinion.",college
354,1600019371.0,Afraid my friend group isn’t maturing fast enough. Or I’m just crazy and the Internet is skewing my perception of reality.,"So basically, my friends and I are all about 23 years old. Two of us are still in college, me included, one graduated, ones in the military, the other I have no clue about. We all hang out at least once a week. When we’re not together, some nights we’ll play video games together. 

When we hang out we just go to each others family homes. None of us own a place yet. Because I’m still in school I can’t pay for a place. I don’t want to work full time and be a student full time. My mom has no issue with me staying home. Similar situations with my friends. 

When we hang out we still avoid parents and rip nicotine sticks and get high. It’s fun but it’s getting repetitive and old. This morning my friends mom made us breakfast. I wasn’t sure how I felt about it. We’re 23 and still having sleepovers and having moms make us breakfast. Is this normal or should we be concerned?

357,1696947088.0,My professor had a baby and the new teacher changed a bunch of things in the syllabus,"We're about 6 weeks into the semester, and last week, right before our midterm for this class, my professor gave birth, and consequently, we had a sub for the review and midterm. It was then announced that we would be getting a new instructor for the remainder of the class. The new instructor is this young guy, and he has changed a BUNCH of stuff on the syllabus. So many new assignments were added overnight. I only stayed in this class because of the predictability of the assignment structure. He removed the quizzes and reading grades and instead changed it to in class discussions and projects. Multiple 10 minute presentation that we have to do now instead. I hate this.

For some reference, this class is a 3 credit hour global plan class that I am only taking to fulfill the 12 credit hour requirement. I just changed majors and I cannot take other classes until I finish two introductory courses for that major, so my other classes this semester are just fluff.

Is there anything I can do?

361,1612104169.0,Paying $150 for an access code is a scam. Just go to the website you’ll be using for you homework,"Access codes for webassign, Pearson and other sites professors what you to use really shouldn’t cost as much as a textbook if your only purchasing the access  code. So instead, just login to webassign( or whatever site you’ll be using) and just enter your class code and buy access through them. It’s called an online access code. If you purchase access online, it is automatically applied to your account and it’s normally a fraction of what you pay in the book store. [I’ll even link the support ](https://webassign.com/support/student-support/access-codes/) for doing so explaining each one. Same goes for Pearson. You still get the same resources as everyone else, but you’ll be paying much less. Just think about. Why pay, on average, $150 for a code though your bookstore, when you can go directly to the site and pay less. An access code for my algebra class was $190 but paid $90 after setting up my account and buying it on Pearson.                                  

Say it’s a scam for me to explain to you that you can go through the homework site with class key in hand. Access codes can expire or be recycled without you knowing. So instead of going to your school’s bookstore, go onto the site, select purchase online accesss purchase, and you’ll be saving money on top of the fact it’s faster than waiting in line for it. It’s one of the many things the bookstore will never tell you, because access codes sell quick.",college

Here's the list of schools so far that have cancelled classes in some major capacity:

Vacate dorms means the school has asked all students to move out of dorms. Extended means the school had originally announced cancellations, but added more dates or restrictions following it.

372,1645663649.0,Unpopular opinion: I like online classes more than in-person and I'm gonna tell you why,"I have heard a lot of people complain about online classes. They find that they are less motivated to do the work, there isn't much social interaction, and you basically have to teach yourself the subject. 

I hear you. I really do. It can be tough and frustrating at times. Especially when you have a question and instead of just raising your hand or swinging by your professor's office, you have to set up a zoom meeting or wait for an email response that will probably only answer half of your question. 

The thing I like about online classes, however, is that I can: 

* Work more during the hours I would have been stuck in a classroom
* No commuting to and from campus
* I can do the homework at a time that is convenient for me
* I can rewatch lectures if I don't understand it the first time instead of having to scribble notes as fast as I can and....oh he changed the slide before I could finish this chicken-scratch of a diagram that I won't be able to read later anyway. Sad. 
* Not have to put up with the loudmouths or know-it-alls in the classroom
* I can do the work anywhere I want in whatever outfit I want (the pajama game is strong)

For anyone who has issues with procrastinating like I do (literally me writing this post right now instead of doing Spanish homework), I recommend a couple of tricks I picked up after taking 10+ completely online college classes:

1. Make a schedule and put the due-dates of assignments a couple of days ahead of when they are actually due. This will (hopefully) help with not putting it off until the last minute. I figure that for small assignments, I need at least one day to do a good job and two to three days for bigger assignments. That way I can work on it in little chunks instead of sitting there stressing about a ten-page paper that's due by midnight the day you even think to start working on it. 
2. Work on it in bite-size pieces. Like I said, don't stress yourself out by trying to do everything the day-of. Break the assignment down into manageable chunks and do one part at a time. For a big research paper, for example: Set the due date for four days ahead.

* On **day one**, open the assignment and see what it's asking for. Start by figuring out what you're supposed to be researching. If you get to pick your own topic, spend the day finding something that both meets the papers criteria and that  also interests you. If that's the only thing you get done on day one, that's totally fine. You'll still have three more days to finish it, but at least you're slightly ahead of the game now. 
* **Day two** and **three** should be the actual research and beginning the paper. Try to finish the paper by day three if you can, but it's okay if it doesn't happen. Just try to get close.
* **Day four** is proof-reading and refining before submitting it that night. 

Another piece of advice: Actually email your professor if you get stuck on something. They usually offer online office hours and emails are highly encouraged. I have never had a professor be upset or bothered for me asking a question about something I didn't understand. You aren't bothering them, you aren't stupid for not understanding the material. Just. Email. Them. That's what you're paying them for anyway - to teach you. So let them. 

I could add so much more to this post but I'll leave it at this for now. I hope this eases your fears or unsureness of an online class. They aren't that bad and I actually really like them because of how flexible they are.",college

This semester I took ochem 1, calc 1, and physics 1, all of which are notoriously hard classes and they were all online because of covid and therefore low quality with high expectations. I’ve managed to get all A’s every semester of college up to this point but as you can imagine, this semester was extra hard. I was hanging on to a B in all three classes for basically the entire semester and fighting tooth and nail just to keep it that way. But I managed to get my physics grade up right before the end of the semester. And then I studied my ass off for the calc final and ended up doing really well on it, and our final exam grade would replace our lowest test grade (which for me was like a 58). Ochem was what really shocked me. All assignments graded put me at an 87. She did say she would curve our final grade but I didn’t think it would do anything for me, but it brought me up to an A. I don’t think I’ve ever been this happy in my life. All that blood, sweat, and tears I put into those classes actually paid off and I’m gonna graduate top of my class!

Edit: wow I did not expect this to blow up like this. Thank you so much for all the nice comments! I will say I’m kind of a perfectionist and trying to get into med school so getting straight A’s is probably more important to me than it really should be. Wouldn’t recommend because I had a fuck ton of anxiety this whole semester and now I’m in therapy lol. I’m transferring to a four year university this fall to finish my bachelors and I definitely don’t expect that I’ll hold onto that 4.0 streak, but I’m really happy to have achieved it for just one more semester, especially since I had given up on it a couple of weeks ago.",college
376,1656862994.0,Exposing the Disney College Program,"*if y'all can be so kind to crosspost, we'll get more views on this*

Hi everyone. I recently left my role in the Disney College Program and I thought I would come on here to honestly tell y'all what that experience was like. This is going to be extremely candid, raw and honest. Some of y'all may not like that, and may not like to hear this, but it is all the 100% truth and I feel like needs to be told.

 For starters, when we applied, there was no interview, but in order to accept our program we had to pay 400 dollars. The 400 dollar charge was required whether we lived at Flamingo Crossings (Disney's housing for CP's) or off property in our own place. We paid 400 dollars to come work for Disney, which already was odd, but I didn't think much of it at the time. Then, for those living at Flamingo they went over the rent and roommate processes. For rent, it is automatically taken out of your paycheck weekly, meaning you may only have 50-100 dollars to live on after that. The room layouts come in 4x4 (4 bedrooms 4 bathrooms), 4x2 and 2x2 (2 beds in a room with one bathroom per each room). They tell us that we have the option to pick if we want our rooms to be gender neutral or not, and that we have the option to link with one roommate with the exact same start and end dates. What they did *not* tell us is that if you don't link with someone and pick gender neutral they will often throw you with anyone. There was a case where an 18 year old girl got put into a 2x2 with an older gentleman, as you can finish college at any age. You don't get told who your actual roommate is until 1. You arrive there on your check in date and 2. You sign your lease. Even if you link with someone, they don't bother to tell you that you may still not get out with them. So if you're in a 2x2, you may each get put with the other roommate. For many people who have called Flamingo asking them about roommate issues, or their potentially unsafe matches, the response they have been met with is ""We cannot guarantee your safety"". 

Then there was disability accomodations. My friend, who ended up being my roommate, has celiacs disease. When she went to get an accomodation for her program they connected her with a case advocate who worked to help her get a role that was safe for her. For any of y'all that don't know, celiacs disease makes it so you have a serious autoimmune reaction to gluten, even if it's just simply inhaling particles of it in the air, and it can put you out for weeks or send you to the hospital. Well so she told them her main accommodation she needed was a role that wasn't food and beverage. So where did they put her? Food and beverage. Then she had to fight tooth and nail to get them to change that. Mind the fact this was *before* we even started working. 

Now let's jump to working and arriving. After you move into housing, you are required to go to Traditions, which is the start of your program. At Traditions our speaker blatantly told us ""There will be days you feel depressed, anxious, and not want to go into work. But you *will* go into work regardless. And you are to always smile. Why? Because the guest doesn't care. The guest doesn't care what you're going through"". After that they sent us to get our ID's made, and to finish our registration process. They had us line up to each be asked individually for our information. One part of that was that they asked up, out loud in front of everyone, what our weight was. As you can imagine that was fun for lots of people. 

Jumping into working: they tell you that you are to have 24/7 availability. The rule is that they need to give you at least an 8 hour window between shifts. That's their only rule. So they can schedule as much as humanly possible, for as long as they want as long as they give you 8 hours between then and your next shift. It is extremely common for CP's to be scheduled upwards of 9 days in a row with no breaks, and shifts up to and often times over 12 hours. One of my friends got scheduled 14 days in a row, with almost every day being a 12 hour shift out in the blazing Florida sun, and one of the days even was a 15 hour shift. One of my other close friends went into their leader to tell them how exhausted they were with their program and how they felt they needed a break, and that their mental health was declining and their leader responded ""you came here to work, so get back out there and work"". She has type 1 diabetes and when her number got super low one day she told her leaders she needed an Early Release because she didn't feel good, to which they told her ""The only way we will let you go home is if you are passed out on the ground or need an ambulance"". Now I will say, not every leader is like this, as with anything in life there are good leaders and bad leaders, but sadly this experience with leaders being like this was all too common to hear about at Disney. It also wasn't uncommon to be force extended. At my location we had a huge amount of people one night get force extended, and some of them got put on shifts up to 17 hours. Which in Florida this all surprisingly is legal.

Throughout the program, you learn very quickly that people start self-terming (quitting) left and right. Tons of people came to the program thinking it would help their depression and anxiety because Disney is their happy place, only to have their conditions seriously worsened and have to leave. The vast majority of CP's you talk to will tell you that they hated working at Disney. Some will tell you they liked it, but also hated and noticed all the aforementioned issues. I fell in the middle, as I did love assisting guests, and my coworkers, but that was the only thing holding me on. Disney also gave us a self admission pass, stating that our one benefit of the program was getting into the parks for free. Well that would've been great if we weren't pretty much blocked out from the parks all the time, and we're given the time between shifts to even go. The vast majority of the time we wanted to go to the parks, it was fully blocked out meaning it was unavailable to even go. We were allowed to put in ADO, meaning approved days off, on our HUB to state that we needed specific days off in the future. If we got our ADO approved it meant no matter what we were to not be scheduled. Well I once got my ADO's approved for a week, 2 months in advance, where relatives were coming down including my 90 year old grandma. Only about a week or so before those dates they decided ""nope, we take it back"" and scheduled me anyways, so I had to fight to get at least a few of those days off and then call out the other days which put points on my record. 

For me, due to operational need in the middle of my program they told me my role was being switched. I didn't mind this too much, but then they put me in a role that my disability accomodations didn't allow for. So going to work each day in food and beverage caused me to have allergic reactions  each day. After a week of that I advocated and said I cannot go back into this location, it's too dangerous for me, and that I need my role switched. The leave administration team told me that if I brought in a doctor's note saying I needed a certain amount of days off, that they would honor those days off until I got my role changed and that the points wouldn't go on my record. So I sent in a doctor's note, and they told me I had those days approved and they would tell my leaders and get me in contact with my case advocate so we can do a role change. Seven days into that I get a call from my internship coordinator telling me that they told me false information and that every day I've been out, points are going on my account and that if I don't go back into work soon I would be fired. So I hustled to get in contact with my case advocate and rush to get my role changed, and after 2 weeks they finally got things changed. They told me they would go on and contact my leaders to get the points removed from my account, because a certain amount of points means you're fired, regardless if it's your fault or not. Did they get those points taken off? Nope, instead my case advocated actually ghosted me. My friend had the same case advocate and he ghosted them too. 2 months later and still no points had been taken off and I had gotten reprimands for something that wasn't my fault. 

Jumping forward, after a while in my new role, which I actually did enjoy at times because of my coworkers, I decided that the pros of this definitely did not outweigh the cons and I decided to self term. Since leaving the program, my mental health has gotten exponentially better, I have time to actually enjoy Florida and do things that I am passionate about. Not everything in the program was bad, I had some leaders I personally really liked, my coworkers have become some of my best friends, and I got the experience of being able to truly see what I do and don't want for myself. I am greatful that I did the program because it taught me to advocate for myself and it also made me realize my self worth and what I do not need to put up with. It also gave me an opportunity to move to Florida, where I will be staying from now on. I choose to have a healthy relationship with Disney now and have decided for me, Disney is only for visiting, not for working and I don't want to mesh those two things in my mind anymore. I guess the moral here is that if something doesn't feel right, and you feel like you're being mistreated, you do not need to sit there and let that happen, it is okay to say ""this is enough"" and leave something when it's seriously affecting your mental and emotional well-being.",college

Reminders from the LMS sometimes get lost.

I'm doing course planning for an upcoming class and looking at doing text reminders.  It would be 100% optional and in addition to content pushed out through the LMS/email.  I would encourage students to use a bogus phone number (ie, Google Voice number) if they want to keep their actual number private.

Thoughts? Is it worth my time to set this up for students?

386,1691262226.0,"Am I crazy or are so many people in college ""fake poor?""","I'm talking about the fact that in college a lot of people I've met love talking about how poor they are. Like oh let's go to this place it has great deals, or how they can't go out or do this activity because they're broke, or how this restaurant is too expensive for them, etc. when it's just $25 for a meal plus tip.


Then during Spring break or, because I graduated recently, after graduation, literally all these people are traveling the world. One guy I know like this visited 7 countries in 4 continents. Another group of girls did a trip to 3 European countries. Some other person I know went to visit big US cities. Like, damn, I thought we were both sort of in the same boat but I guess you come from money? Unless it's your parents financing these trips to France or Singapore with your friends.


Unless I'm tripping or something. For the record, my background is ""never going on a plane unless it's visiting my family in Asia every 5-6 years."" And I already know how much that costs. I didn't come from much money at all, but in college I got some internships that paid $25/hr and then $40/hr. So these same people acting like I'm rich now are traveling the world with their friends or family and that's not something I could even imagine.

Hell, one girl I know straight up said she couldn't afford to buy lunch outside of her meal plan bc her bank account legit had only $4. Then next week she comes with her newest phone and the week after she's ubering to parties. All daddy's money (unironically btw, I asked her and she said her dad just venmoed her like a grand for the week) but it's so weird to me.


Is it just me or is stuff like this common as hell? And for the record, I go to a state school. None of these are international students. They're typically not cosplaying being poor.


Edit: Lots of people are focusing on the $25 + tip point which is a really not the main point at all. I mentioned that because for me personally that's a lot (I think $10 or less is fine and anything more usually hurts to buy) but $25 + tip is good for like a once-in-awhile thing. And the people I'm mentioning eat out way more than me. It's not like I'm carelessly going out for expensive meals. In college I ate out like once or twice a week max with like a $10-15 meal, the rest I just cooked. In my examples it's more like I will spend $12 on 5 meals a month and maybe $30 eating in at a restaurant once every 1.5 months while these guys be spending like $7 on starbucks every day and $15-20 on delivery several times a week, but anything more as a single purchase is expensive.",college

Today, I had a midterm in art history and I had the bright idea to once again, pull another all nighter. I thought I had the willpower to do so but I ended up passing out at around 7am and then waking up in horror at around 3pm. I had slept through all of my 37 alarms (Also apologies to my roommate I’m trying to get better at it) and missed my midterm. I frantically emailed my professor and told him my situation and if there’s a remedy to this whole disaster, but I have a good feeling he’s not going to cut me any slack. I don’t really know what to do at this point and if I should just withdraw from the class because the only grades we get are a midterm, final paper, and final exam.

I ended up going with the mug/candy suggestion. I wish I had taken a picture of the gift before I gave it to him (pretty standard though, a green Christmas mug that I filled with a hot chocolate thing and a handful of loose, wrapped chocolates). I spent well over 30 minutes standing in TJ Maxx trying to decide on which mug to get him (because I’m dumb and indecisive), but I found one that said something about the North Pole or some shit and was a good size to fit treats in.

I also included a little card, basically just saying how much I appreciated his enthusiasm and friendliness, especially since being a student can be really rough sometimes. I didn’t write *too* much because I didn’t wanna pour my heart out and write some long thing about my mental health and the fact this semester has been unbearably hard at times, so I basically just left it at “thanks for being cheerful and making it easier” or whatnot. 

He seemed super delighted and thanked me like a thousand times. I promised I’d continue to stop in next semester and just... thanks y’all. I can be a really anxious person and I overthink things a lot (i.e. spending an ungodly amount of time looking at mugs) and if y’all hadn’t been so encouraging and helpful on my original post, I probably would’ve been too nervous to get and give him a gift.

I am currently doing a master's. High school and university as a whole has been fucking hell for me, I hate studying, I hate the ridiculous demands asked from students, especially during this damn pandemic, everything is fucking shit and teachers only keep demanding more and more. Students are having fucking mental breakdowns and reaching burnout all over the place, and everyone talks about it as if it's just a quirky side effect of going to college. WTF.

My previous uni literally set up a ""crying chamber"" to ""let out all the stress"" so ""you can go back to studying with a clear head again"". Like, that is the most dystopian, ignorant bullshit I've heard in my entire life. How about fixing your messed up system? How about not driving students to the point of insanity in the first place?

I've been pushing myself through this, and I don't exaggerate this: HELL, just so I could live comfortably. Get more job opportunities, with hopefully better pay, so I can live a comfortable life. But I feel like I've reached my absolute limit. Teachers and other try-hard students alike expect us to study, seek internships, seek extracurricular activities, etc. 24 fucking 7.

I have news for you. I do not care this much about my studies. And I will never care enough about ANY type of study or job, to be spending 24/7 on it. I am violently against this hyperproductivity culture. The fact that I get called ""lazy"" for not spending more than 8 hrs per day studying complicated af stuff, instead of pushing myself to the point of complete exhaustion, is INSANE. I will NEVER stand for it. If there's people that manage to do it, I'm genuinely so happy for you that you're so tirelessly passionate about something, but for the love of God, do NOT act as if it's something normal that can be expected from everyone.

That's all I have to say on this. I am seriously considering quitting my degree because I'm just so, so done. I want to be surrounded by people with normal standards. I want to fucking breathe. I want to feel human again. I can't be the only one that feels this way right?

I'm sorry this system is so shit and that we all have to suffer through it. But I'm amazed at the strength everyone has to still keep pushing through. We really do deserve more credit than we get.

To give some background (as I saw some questions about my situation): I have a bachelors in psychology, and am now doing a masters in cognitive & clinical neuroscience, specializing in drug development. Basically, a whole load of STEM. Which I chose because I find it vastly interesting. But yeah, quite the switch in work ethic as I've noticed. Not that I think that justifies it in any way, I still believe everyone should have the right to have normal working/studying hours and maintain their sense of well-being regardless of which field they choose. I also see a lot of references to ""American work culture"", which I find funny because I'm currently studying in the Netherlands and have never been outside of Europe. But I'm not surprised this stuff is a global problem (hence the tag).  

Either way, I'm gonna set some concrete boundaries for myself and project partners/teachers for the foreseeing future, and then I'll see how next period flies. Might quit, might pull through after all, but let's hope that whatever we choose leads us to more quality of life in the end.",college

419,1646425497.0,"Pro tip before college: learn what ""liberal arts"" means","*Way* too many people are in here going in talking shit or praising liberal arts degrees while simultaneously **not knowing what it means**.

If you need a refresher (and oh my god some of you really do):

""Liberal arts"" refers to degrees focusing in the humanities, mathematics, and social & physical sciences. A ""Liberal arts college"" is a college specializing in undergraduate degrees in these subjects. 

No, a university that *has* these degrees does not necessarily make it ""liberal arts."" 

No, ""the arts"" are not the same thing. The arts can refer to a lot of things, but in general it just means creative means of expression, both fine arts and in things such as film, theater, and literature. 

""Liberal Arts Education"" *can* refer to the general education system in some instances. In general it's a similar concept to a ""liberal arts college,"" but context is very necessary here.

No, ""Liberal arts"" has nothing to do with the political ""liberal."" Liberal arts in this instance is derived from the latin *Liberalis ars* which generally means ""free art / practice.""

TL;DR: Social science, physical science, philosophy, math, and literature. Sometimes it means ""general education."" No, it's not political. You can be conservative and have a liberal arts degree.

430,1703107243.0,Professor refuses to admit he is wrong.,"Basically the title. 
Two days ago we had a multiple choice exam « online » (still in the exam hall but on laptops) that got graded by a computer. 


We got the results 2 hours after the exam and we noticed that the computer flagged some answers wrong even though they were the correct ones. 


Some students emailed the professor reporting the issue.


His response? « Yeah no there’s nothing wrong with the grading, goodbye. » 


So lots of us are going to lose ~5 marks on the exam just because he doesn’t want to check the answers.


And before you ask, yes, we are 100% sure they are wrong.


Is there anything we can do? Who should we contact if we can?

I already bought a greeting card that seems pretty generic, but also motivational.  Basically saying “you got this!”

She loves those Christmas butter cookies (Royal Dansk)

I *could* just order the cookies off Amazon and have them shipped directly to her…and just mail that greeting card with a stamp.

But would it be better/more thoughtful to put together a little care package?

437,1637259641.0,"Calculus Professor just assigned 8 hours of lecture, and 32 quizzes over Thanksgiving break… Please help.","I wish I was making this up… 

I’m a Freshman in Calc 2 and due to my professor rambling on and on in class about useless stories, and his “incredible math skills” he’s super behind on content. So naturally, he had the genius idea of assigning 4 chapters over break, each chapter containing 4 30-minute lecture videos, accompanied by a 30 minute timed quiz for each video. He’s just using his old lecture videos to assign to us. 

We got assigned these today, (the day before our break) and they are due November 29th (the day we get back) So he’s basically forcing us to teach ourselves the content and spend an ungodly amount of time studying during break. To make matters worse, the exam on these 4 chapters is also the day we get back from break.

So I’m wondering, is it normal in college for professors to assign this much work during break??? Anyone with similar experiences? And any advice on how to get all of it done? At this point, I’m so stressed out and now I won’t even have a Thanksgiving break. Thanks Professor!


Update: 

Wow, I didn’t expect to be given so much good advice! Thank you all for your concerns and great advice regarding my issue at hand. 

I ended up emailing my professor in order to clarify his work expectations for us over break, and he ended up telling me that there will be only 16 20-minute quizzes, not 32 as he originally stated. That makes more sense due to my calculations of 4 chapters, each with 4 videos and a quiz after each video.

It makes me feel a bit better about the situation, but it’s still a lot of work to be done, and quite frankly, pretty shitty of him to assign over break. As stated above, he is the type of professor that has a very difficult time actually teaching the course, and as a result, gets very distracted, goes on half-hour tangents, and brags about his degree. He also expects us students to often know much more than we actually do, so he gets frustrated when we ask questions. 

If I can take anything positive from this experience, it is that I will finally be able to learn Calculus 2 in an uninterrupted way. I will be free of his useless tangents and stories, so I can hopefully better prepare for the exam this way, as opposed to his “teaching strategy.” 

Thanks all!",college
438,1609694665.0,"You pay for college, you should know how it operates.","I’m gonna lead off the bat by saying this can be a long post. As someone that works professionally in Higher ed, and as someone who got their masters in student affairs and higher ed have a pretty strong understanding of how universities operate at their core. For you students out there, my plan is to lay a pretty decent foundation here to help you understand many different aspects of how your university probably operates, since you pay for it and are the reason these institutions exist. I’ll say, I’m not the expert on everything or every type of university, and my experience is entirely in the United States so that is who this will be most relevant to, but I’m hoping I can bring some interesting info to you on this Sunday morning! 

First and foremost, universities are businesses at the core. Just like Target, Walmart, or Amazon, they have a bottom line that needs to be met. Your tuition and student fees pay this bottom line, alongside federal and state funding if your institution is public. The more students a university has, the better faculty they can hire, the more research they can pump out, the better alumni they can get who will hopefully donate, and the cycle continues. Your money is being put into a long term investment by the university to sustain itself. The biggest expenditure of any university? Faculty and staff. Let’s break those down. 

Faculty are your professors and researchers who teach courses, contribute to scientific papers, and experts of a given field. Thing is, any bit of discovery or research faculty yield, their intellectual property in other words, belongs to the university. If I were a cancer researcher and made a massive breakthrough in cancer treatment, that belongs to my employer, not me. This is not an exclusive practice to higher ed, but consider how faculty are paid and tenured up front and how it is part of a larger system for an institution to protect their investments. 

Staff are everyone else. These are your custodial staff, dining staff, residence hall employees, student activities peeps, diversity center staff, etc. If the faculty are left brain, staff are right brain. Their job is to keep amenities usable, create safe environments for all on campus, and create learning/social opportunities outside of the lecture hall. I fall into this category. 

Let’s stick with this left brain and right brain analogy. Left brain are your academic affairs team, they are focused on the classroom experience and your enrichment in the field you have specified. Your advisors, faculty and program chairs are gonna work to develop your academic capital.  Your right brain, student affairs, will work to adjust you to being a strong functioning member of a global society, helping you network and meet people you would never normally meet. They’re focused on your social capital. These two parts of the brain are meant to work in tandem, but at many universities they grind up against each other. Some in student affairs view those in academic affairs as pretentious or uncaring. Some in academic affairs see those in student affairs as wasteful or unnecessary. I’m not here to say who is right or wrong, but instead advocate that they need to work together to create the best experience for all. 

Let’s talk about how your money breaks down further: your fees pay for all the above staff and faculty, as well as dining halls, programs on campus, sports and clubs. Sports are seen as big money makers on campus: this isn’t always true! Sure, some very large programs (think Alabama or UT Austin) turn a profit on their sports programs, and usually the profit from these programs go into paying for other sports on campus. Usually though, sports programs break even on their costs or even subsidize the costs across the whole student body. Sports have become their own worst enemy: they need to fill seats and charge fees to sustain themselves lest they fall apart. 

Another important thing to know about your money: it doesn’t always pay for what you think it does. Some departments or offices on campus are auxiliary services. What that means is that they do NOT receive federal funding. Housing is a great example of this. All money that housing uses is *usually* only what is earned by students living in the halls. So your money goes into paying for the maintenance of all buildings, housing staff, programming etc. Parking is another auxiliary service. This is not to defend they high prices of living on campus, but instead to help explain why some of those costs are the way they are. 

One last thing I’ll cover here is power. The head of your university may be titled President, Chancellor, Dean etc. You may believe this person holds all the power on campus: this isn’t necessarily true. Most heads of universities are tasked with two big things: build strong alumni relationships to get more funds, and build strong political connections on behalf of the university. These presidents or chancellors are truly political figures at the core and they have lots of different people in their ears telling them what to do: student governments, faculty and staff associations, alumni, parents, and the biggest of all, board of regents/directors. This board is where lots of power rests. I’d recommend you learn who is on your board and what their backgrounds are: this can help you understand a lot of decisions made on your campus. Ultimately though, the power is in the consumer, and that is the student body. The ability to make changes as students cannot be understated. 


Whew. That is a lot. And it doesn’t even scratch the surface of all that is there. I’m hoping that this helps provide some interesting information of how funds are allocated, how systems operate, and where the power rests in any given institution. As a student who is paying to uphold all these different things, I believe it is your responsibility to know how your money is spent and how you are being advocated for on multiple levels. My career is in supporting students through their higher ed journey and I love it to death. Because I love it so much, I really believe that it is my duty to be honest and transparent with those who pay my salary. Hopefully y’all enjoyed this and finds use in it!",college

My high school experience wasn’t the best because I felt terribly lonely all the time. I hardly had any friends, never went to parties or just out with anyone, didn’t have a boyfriend(still haven’t had one) and being introverted didn’t help the situation either. I missed out on a ton of things and memories because of my self esteem issues and introvertedness. I graduated with one friend I thought would be my life friend but that didn’t work out and I now keep in contact with no one from high school. 

Community college was pretty much the same situation. The first 2 semesters were great though. I met a lot of cool people but those friendships never lasted. The last 2 semesters I felt just as lonely as I did in high school. 

Fast forward to now, after me transferring to my university and doing all online classes for the past 2 semesters, I still feel like the same person I was in high school. I will say that I’ve changed a lot mentally and physically however. I gained a lot more confidence, came out of my shell a little, and my mindset isn’t the same. But after scrolling through Instagram and stalking the pages of my former classmates, seeing them doing great things, having fun with friends, getting married, having kids etc. I can’t help but feel like I haven’t changed at all these past 3 years.

This morning I received a canvas email saying my grade was changed, I checked my grades and saw that the essay was changed to a 50 and there was a comment from my professor added. To partially paraphrase what he said he noticed that a “good bit” of my essay had been AI generated, he stated that although this is against what he told the class countless times to not do he decided to give me a 50 rather than a 0 as most of my essay appears to be written by me, This is 60% of my grade.


That was a few hours ago and I feel like I have aged 4 years from how pissed off I am as this might mess up a lot of future planes for me as it means I have failed this class. I sent him an email stating my innocence and even ran my essay through an ai detection software which stated it was “extremely unlikely” to be ai generated and sent that screenshot to him. I also sent him multiple word documents of my essay progress in hopes that it will be enough. But I fear it won’t be enough to convince him. Is there any other proof that I can gather to prove my innocence?


Update: he sent me a response email stating I can go to his office to discuss this and to “be honest about it” he told me that it wasn’t a turnitin issue but instead an AI generator issue. No idea what exactly that means but I hope I’ll be able to convince him later today


Final update: we cleared it up together, set up a one on one and despite having no solid evidence like my full edit history since it wasn’t available on my MacBook he believed me because of the discussion we have had in the past regarding my essay and because I never missed class, he also asked me random questions about certain phrases I used and I was able to answer them so it led him to believe me. It turns out that a student that spoke little to no English with a C in his class submitted an A+ essay that had perfect English which led him to go around and scan everybody’s essay with AI detection software which he used on mine and it said some of my sentences were ai generated.

The uni I'm at has a decent amount of dorm options, but I really wanted to go with the one in the center of campus, which was in high demand due to the location. On room selection day I was lucky enough to get one of the very last rooms available at my desired residence hall. I was matched with a random roommate and thought everything good to go until they messaged me the next day telling me to switch out because the spot in his dorm was meant for his friend.

By now, there are no other rooms available in that residence hall since it was in such high demand, meaning that if I gave up the spot I would have to go to one of the dorms at the edge of campus. I was really looking forward to living in my selected dorm because it's really close to all my classes and I'm almost fully legally blind, meaning biking / driving / skating around isn't an option for me and walking was a super convenient option from where I was (planning on) living. 

Now, though, it seems that I've been given the ultimatum of either being forced to move out to another dorm or live with someone who does not want to live with me. On the housing application sheet, there was a section meant to indicate whether or not you were planning on living with a selected roommate or a random roommate, and this person says something went wrong with their friend's application which is why they weren't automatically paired. I've contacted the university housing department (no response yet) and my assigned roommate is getting pushy about me choosing somewhere else to live.

459,1589996198.0,Tips on how to raise your GPA as an average student,"I technically made the dean's list this semester with a GPA of 3.55. I know for some it may not too high, but as someone who made a post at the end of last semester how to increase my pithy GPA of 2.98, it has been a good reminder that grades are not an accurate reflection of your self-worth.

This sub has helped me in the past, so I decided to make a post giving some personal suggestions and reflecting on some of the study habits that I adopted this semester.

&#x200B;

1. ***Make a planner or calendar*** with all the due dates from the syllabus. Update this as changes arise. I also make a breakdown of grades for each course.
2. ***Grind to score well in your first midterm or major assignments.*** They cover the basic topics in the course that later material builds on. My personal opinion is that it sets the expectations for both how you and the professor believe you are going to perform in the course. Furthermore, they are usually comparatively easier & therefore important for courses in which you can only drop 5-8% points to score an A.
3. Be that kid that ***speaks up in class***. Clearing up doubts as they arise is very important. You will not remember to look it up later. This will help the professor remember who you are (hint: professors like students that are interested in what they teach!)
4. ***Do the readings when they are assigned.***
5. ***Review what you do after each class***. Summarise by writing down notes or typing out the important points that you have learned in class (each time) using your own notes, lecture slides, book, handouts, and readings.
6. ***Go to*** ***office hours,*** and not just before the exams. Office hours are for you to make use of. Ask your silly questions (if you still too shy to ask in a lecture setting) or ask for clarification on what the assignments are. Very important as soon as you feel like you are struggling. t is as simple as saying, that you feel like you are struggling or not doing well you had hoped.
7. ***Exploit the rubric***. For a majority of the assignments professors layout word-to-word an outline of what they expect from you in the rubric. Follow it!!

I've ran out of a room crying once when everyone looked at me to answer a question in class.
I wanted to change this about myself, so I went into college as a Communication major, marketing minor, joined a marketing club (now on the executive board), and got a job in hospitality and another job in sales. 

I have gotten a lot better EXCEPT for standing in front of an entire room of people looking at me while it's dead silent. Couple examples:

1. Gave a speech about boba tea in front of a class of about 30 students (could've been worse). Rambled for about 3 minutes about how a lot of people don't like it because of the sucking balls into your mouth part and the texture. Yea

2. Dad jokes. I wear glasses so I walked into a room to give a pitch and I said ""You know the great thing about being blind as a bat and having social anxiety? I can take my glasses off and it's like none of you are here"" and I took off my glasses and put them on the table and proceeded with my pitch.

It is now very much the norm for students to bring their laptops to class to take notes. I am fine with that and allow it as do a vast majority of my colleagues. But please know that it is very obvious to your instructor when you are doing something other than taking notes. You might be online, messaging a friend, playing a game, or doing whatever one might do with an open laptop; we know. You might ask 'how do you know?' There are many signs. Maybe I am not talking for a minute while a student speaks but you are frantically typing away. Maybe I am discussing something rather mundane and you keep looking at your laptop and smiling. Maybe I cold call on you and you have no idea what we are discussing. Maybe it is because you have not looked up from your screen for 30 straight minutes.

It is possible that you do not care that we know but you should. Because when you bomb an assignment and come running to me for leniency I will remember. When you email me asking for clarification on something I discussed at length while you were distracted I'll have to decide how quickly to respond to that email. I'm not a dick, I am very student-centered but respect is a two way street and if you show me none I am hard pressed to want to show you any.

My question is: where is that money going to end up?","After doing some research, it seems that the $23 billion, similar to the $14 billion, is being earmarked for the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF). But, does anyone know how these funds will be used exactly, and will it be similar to the March relief?

**EDIT:**

I think I found the allocation scheme. It's starts on line 16 on page 1872 of the bill which is titled ""HIGHER  EDUCATION  EMERGENCY  RELIEF  FUND""

Specifically on line 19 of page 1877, it states how the universities may use the funds allocated to them.

Here is the excerpt:

**USES  OF FUNDS —An  institution  of  higher  education  receiving  funds  under  this  section  may  use  the  funds received to**

>**(1)  defray  expenses  associated  with  coronavirus (including  lost  revenue,  reimbursement  for  expenses already  incurred,  technology  costs  associated  with  a transition  to  distance  education,  faculty  and  staff  trainings, and payroll);**  
>  
>**(2)  carry  out  student  support  activities  authorized   by   the   HEA   that   address   needs   related   to   coronavirus;**  
>  
>**(3)  provide  financial  aid  grants  to  students  (including  students  exclusively  enrolled  in  distance  education), which may be used for any component of the student’s  cost  of  attendance  or  for  emergency  costs that  arise  due  to  coronavirus,  such  as  tuition,  food,  housing,  health  care  (including  mental  health  care),  or  child  care.  In  making  financial  aid  grants  to  students,   an   institution   of   higher   education   shall   prioritize  grants  to  students  with  exceptional  need, such as students who receive Pell Grants.**

EDIT 2:

I think I found the provision that dictates the amount higher institutions are required to give as financial aid to students.  It's starts on line 11 of page 1880. It states the following:

>**(5)  Institutions  of  higher  education  receiving  allocations  under   section  314(a)(1)  of  this  title  shall  provide  at  least  the   same  amount  of  funding  in  emergency  financial  aid  grants  to   students  as  was  required  to  be  provided  under  sections   18004(a)(1)  and (c) of division B of the CARES Act (Public Law  16116–136).**  An  institution  of  higher  education  that  repurposes  funds  pursuant  to  paragraph  (2)  **shall  ensure  that  not  less  than  50  percent  of  the  funds  received under section 18004(a)(1) of division B of the CARES  Act  (Public  Law  116–136)  are  used  for  financial  aid  grants  to  students**  under  either  section  18004(c)  of  division  B  of  the  CARES  Act  or  section  314(c)(3)  of  this  title,  or  a  combination  of  those  sections:

&#x200B;

So, it seems that the students that received payments in March from their university will also be receiving it this time around, as well. However, I'm not sure if more students are going to be included in these payments. Given that there's going to be almost $11 Billion dollars more in funding this time, it would only make sense that either more students receive money or the students that received money last time will get more, but nothing has made sense this year, so I wouldn't bet on this making sense either.

I may be missing something here, so if one of y'all find better info, please don't hesitate to correct me. It'll help all of us get a better picture of what's going on.

Most schools have formal review surveys called “Professor Evaluations” that they ask folks to do at the mid term and the end of the semester. These are extremely helpful for the professor, administrators and future students. They are anonymous and the professors don’t see the results until after they submit a grade. Administration looks at these reviews when deciding to rehire adjunct professors and during tenure review for full time professors. If you’re experiencing a truly awful teacher this can also add to a paper trail when you report them. 

Throughout my schooling, My professors have had to beg students to fill them out and they get low responses. This sucks because it’s really a great way to commend great professors and chastise shitty ones. 

If you’re unsure if your school has this review system in place, it’s most likely in your student portal. You can also email the academic department or registrar.

499,1593356721.0,Weird and rude comments I’ve gotten when telling people my major,"My major is elementary ed. Here are some of the responses I’ve gotten when telling people that this is my major:

“Oh, that’s cute” (what the hell?)

“I’ve heard ed majors skip class a lot. Is that true?” (I go to class, thanks for asking)

“I’m (engineering/pre-med/etc) so I’m taking a lot of science and math classes you don’t have to take.” (Good for you, I guess? I don’t really believe that more difficult classes make a major superior to others, so I guess I just don’t really get the point to this one)

“Do you ever feel like you’re selling yourself short?” (No.)

“Wouldn’t you rather be a child psychologist/social worker/lawyer?” (I think for some reason the fact that I’m *not* jumping straight from undergrad to grad school makes a lot of people uncomfortable. That’s really not my problem, sorry)

EDIT: I just remembered a bonus one: “you should try to get into a private school! Public school teachers make so little money!” Fun fact: public school teachers tend to make more money than private school teachers. As a general rule, it’s not a good idea to give advice when you don’t know what you’re talking about. 

I think the more polite thing to do is to say something simple like “cool!” when someone says their major, or make a connection (“my sister has the same major!”) or ask a relevant, easy-to-answer question (“I heard the department of xyz is merging with your department. Is that true?”). 

I’m sure plenty of people in other fields have similar experiences. What weird/rude responses have you gotten when you tell people your major? How would you prefer the conversation to go?",college

This is a discussion of my experiences  in a dining hall and standing up for myself. I am a college student who was kicked out of an a ""all-you-can-eat"" dining hall 2 times and harassed multiple times for eating too much over the course of this semester at the dining halls. I complained to the dining executive management, who said it was unfair and he said sorry. He seemed kind of sad when I told him of these incidents. He then said he would have a talk with the dining hall staff workers. Today, I sent him an email explaining if he came to a conclusion on the dining hall matter. He said he would inputted 25 dollars for all my troubles and he sent over a team to the dining halls so it would never happen again. I'm really proud of myself for reaching out to him, but I felt the money wasn't worth losing my dignity honestly. I only ate one meal at the dining hall(it was all I could afford), and I am a skinny boy who weighs sub 160 pounds who ate roughly 2 thousand calories per day from that dining hall. I am glad it will(hopefully) never happen again at my university's dining hall. My university is a rich university so idk why the dining staff harassed me for my eating habits.

A concern I have is possible retaliation from the bullying dining staff. Will they seek revenge if I go back to the dining hall(advertised as all-you-can-eat)? I'm worried.",college

What to do when your professor asks questions on quizzes and exams that they never went over in lecture? 

This is an ongoing thing with all of her exams and quizzes, and she offers no extra credit for the class. 

Example: we learned in class that cooking cast iron increases iron absorption.

On the quiz: what increases iron absorption? 

The answer: cooking in cast iron and using acidic sauces.

Not once did she mention acidic sauces in class and there is no way this is a critical thinking Q with what she’s taught. 

This isn’t the only example I have but she locks the exams so I can’t go look back at the specific questions. I am trying to remember the Q better now that I know she has answers she never taught. 

Another ex of how she asks questions: infants need 9 essential amino acids, adults need 8  (learned in lecture)

Question: how many amino acids do adults and infants need? (I remember this Q specifically bc I had to think it through)

I answered 8, she said the answer was 9(when I asked what I got wrong). I feel like this was a trick question?? Because both need 8, not 9. 

I emailed her about it and she didn’t respond. I looked up her rate my professor and this is a common theme in this class and her more advanced class too (I will be paying $$$ to take the class anywhere else than with her next semester). She asks things she never discussed in lecture and sometimes the questions/answers are wrong. 

With the recent Q on cast iron, I asked for credit for the answer I gave because she never went over acidic sauces in class. 

Exact message: “Cooking with acidic sauces was not taught in class lecture and there is no mention of it in the notes. Is there a way I could please receive credit for this question? I went back and re-watched the lectures as well as looking through my notes thoroughly and there is no mention of cooking with acidic sauces. Using cast iron is the only thing you taught us so there is no way I knew that. Thank you, name”

533,1596397339.0,"To help people who are wondering how much stuff they need to bring for college, here’s some guidance.","I was a transfer student, so I’ve lived in the dorms at multiple different schools. I’m generally a bit of a pack rat, so I’ve developed a minimalist approach to packing for college in order to keep clutter at bay. This minimalist approach is especially important this semester, since you might end up having to leave with short notice due to the pandemic. Here’s some advice:

(Note: I am a girl, guys might pack a bit differently, but I think most of this advice is gender-neutral)

Clothes:
- only bring clothes that are appropriate for the climate and season where your school is. Think to yourself, “will I realistically need this clothing item between now and the next time I come home?” If not, don’t bring it. 

- only bring two week’s worth of clothes. This will keep clothing clutter to a minimum and motivate you to do laundry regularly so you don’t have dirty clothes everywhere. 

- Most of your clothes should be casual and comfortable, but you should have one “going out” outfit (you shouldn’t be going to parties this semester, but you might want to dress up if you have a date or something) and at least one professional-looking outfit for if you have a job interview or presentation. 

- maximum 6 pairs of shoes. Any more than that will be difficult to find space for in your little dorm closet, and will take up a ton of space in your luggage. You will be walking around a lot more than you did in high school, so plan your shoe choices accordingly. Function over fashion. 

Decor:

- This semester I’m actually not bringing any decor at all. I know it sounds depressing, but a lack of decor will make it much easier to pack everything up if I end up having to leave. Under normal circumstances, though, I recommend photos, posters, and string lights or garlands. 

- DO NOT BRING ANYTHING that takes up space on a horizontal surface. Your desk is small, and you will need it for your school supplies, papers, and as a space for eating and/or doing makeup. You will regret bringing anything non-functional that takes up space on your desk or other flat surface. If you want to decorate, use your walls!

- I wouldn’t recommend bringing a tapestry. My roommate had two of them and they were constantly falling down because dorm-friendly wall adhesives (i.e. adhesives that won’t damage the wall) aren’t strong enough for tapestries. 

- Some dorms have really crappy lighting. In my first dorm, the light was so dim it was essentially useless. I ended up buying an LED floor lamp to solve this problem. If you don’t know what the lighting will be like, wait until after you move in and then buy a floor lamp from a local store if it ends up being necessary. 

- If you ever do makeup, bring a desktop mirror so you can do your makeup at your desk. Your roommates/floormates might get annoyed if you’re constantly using the bathroom sink mirror for applying makeup. 

Other things:

- Don’t bring too many dishes. One or two of each item is good. Plus, some items can serve double-duty! For example, I didn’t have a bowl and whenever I wanted soup or something, I ate out of my coffee mug. Make sure to bring dish soap, a sponge, and a dish towel so you can wash your dishes in the sink. Your dorm probably won’t have a dishwasher. 

- Only bring the hair care stuff you actually use. My mom told me to bring a hairdryer, but I hate blow-drying my hair, so that hairdryer was a total waste of space. You know yourself best. Bring the stuff you know you will use, leave behind the stuff you probably won’t use. The same applies for makeup and jewelry. 

- Bring cleaning supplies to keep your room hygienic. If you have a bathroom in your dorm room, you and your roommate(s) will be responsible for cleaning it, so bring bathroom cleaning supplies. If you have a communal bathroom though, you will not be responsible for cleaning it. 

- For school supplies, bring the stuff that works best for you. If you prefer using pens instead of pencils for note-taking, bring lots of pens and only a couple pencils. If you love organizing with folders but you hate 3-ring binders, don’t bring binders. You are the boss of your organization system in college. There is no school supply list. Pick the supplies that have previously worked well for you, and leave the ones you’ve always hated behind. 

- Even after using these less-is-more tricks, you might still feel like you have too much stuff. At that point, you probably don’t have too much stuff. 

Hope this helps! Feel free to add your own tips in the comments.

Edit: One last thing... if you end up needing something that you didn’t bring, you can pick it up from home on your next trip back or order it online. Sometimes it’s actually better to underpack than to overpack. You might be surprised how much you don’t actually need.",college

So my professor ended up contracting COVID-19 and disappeared. With about 2 weeks left in our accelerated 6-week summer course, Prof slowly started coming back online. We ended up dropping a lot of labs and quizzes altogether from the syllabus and focused on the important shit. Also, prof made it clear he would be generous with grades since we were left to our own defenses to learn 6 chapters. We wrapped up on time and I got a solid A so I was happy to just wait for the prof to come back in the end. However, I did not learn what I would have had we had a normal class and so that is a little concerning. I am following up with the second part of this subject in the fall ( I took class A1 and now need to take class A2) so I may struggle but only time will tell. Prof did video lectures remainder of class - even being clearly sick he made a solid effort, and I really appreciate that. I thought he was strange for using a cell phone but turns out he was teaching from a hospital while in isolation - which is crazy and I have no idea how Prof did that but they did. 

So here is my advice to any student who ends up in a similar situation. First, start reading the textbook and plan on teaching yourself - while making sure to follow the schedule unless it changes. Message your classmates (even if its 100% online and you don't know them personally), because odds are they have the same questions and will respond to you asap). If you get to the point where you haven't heard anything in over a week first email the Prof, then if no response then email your advisement consular who can help too. If all fails come back here and let us know because we have a LOT of awesome people in this sub that have really good advice. 

Life happens. Stay committed and on task. and this too shall pass.

No one dares to admit it, but college students are awful about abandoning animals. Many students graduate and move to new places that don't take animals so they ""just so happen"" to lose their animals and leave their cats and dogs behind as strays, especially cats.

If you live in your college town during the summer, you may notice that many stray cats pop up immediately after graduation or when leases tend to end. It's also seen somewhat in the shelters, too. 

Don't be an asshole. Animals are not a toy. If you adopt one, either keep it or hand it off to another responsible owner, but for the love of all things, don't just toss it on the street.",college

541,1683641626.0,Over 75% of my Class got a perfect score on an exam I almost failed,"I go to a college in the US. I just took a final in a class that up to the final I was near the top of the class of, I was one of the only students that could answer questions the professor asked and did significantly better on open-ended quizzes. It's a very difficult class so I spent over 4 days and probably 40-50 hours studying for the final, reading the textbook, memorizing vocab, etc. Also for context, this class is a lecture class with hundreds of students.

The day of the final came and on the multiple choice section I got a 32/50, so a 64%. I thought that the exam was really difficult, and while I figured I did worse than the average student, I thought the average would be pretty low, but over 50% of the class had a perfect score on the test, and 75% had it right within 1 point of perfect. I am assuming that a test bank for the exam was leaked, especially since over half the class finished the exam in under 20 minutes.

Am I right to assume that people cheated on this exam? And how do I recover from this to focus on the rest of my finals? I am a straight A student for the most part and I have only ever done this poorly once before. All of this is just putting a massive pit in my stomach and I feel like such a failure, it's making me feel like studying is pointless. Like I worked so hard and I still failed, so why even bother trying? And if cheating is this rampant then a good grade doesn't really mean much anyway.

edit: I should mention this is a senior-level genetics class, and generally considered one of the harder classes for my major. It's heavy memorization and concept based, so even if you understand the concepts, if you forget what a particular gene does, you will still probably get the question wrong, and vice versa. ",college

548,1565663878.0,"Dear Incoming Freshmen,","As the summer is winding down and you are getting ready to leave home and go off to your college of choice (if you haven’t already), this post is for you. 

Leaving for college is both a liberating and terrifying experience. You leave everything that you’ve ever known to go to this place to peruse a better life for yourself. While there is much honor in doing this, there is no doubt that you feel scared to leave the comfort of your parents home and the life that you have become accustomed to. You will be leaving your parents and your home (for those of you not commuting), your friends, your pets, your room, etc. You go to this new place with no idea what to expect and not knowing many people. Many college students have gone through this. 

As a sophomore, I will admit that I do not know everything that there is to no know about going away to college. However, I can say that I can offer pieces of advice. 

Going away to college is a big deal. It is a major transitional period in your life. Your parents know this, your professors know this. That being said, in your freshman year, professors and school officials do tend to be more lenient toward freshman because they are adjusting to the new lifestyle of living away from home and on their own. 

Once you move in to your new dorm, the reality of the situation will not begin to set in until your parents leave (If they helped you move in. I know that some kids drive themselves). Once they leave, take some time to unpack and organize your things. Then maybe take a walk around campus, either by yourself or with a roommate, to familiarize yourself with your surroundings and the layout of the campus. 

Don’t try to join too many clubs or organizations because if you do what I did, you try to sign up for as many things as possible. Please take into consideration that you are acclimating to this new lifestyle and don’t try to overwhelm yourself with unnecessary activities. You also need to make time to do everything, such as study and do your laundry. More power to those that can handle it all though.

Remember to be respectful of your roommate. You will share a room and maybe a bathroom with this person for the whole year. It is better to be at a good understanding of each other’s boundaries then to deal with the fallout from not doing so later. Also remember to set up those boundaries earlier. Your RAs will most likely encourage this. An RA told me something that I will never forget and its that you will not always be best friends with your roommate, sometimes you are just simply that; roommates. 

Keep your classes and classwork organized. You will save so much time not having to dig through piles of paper to find one assignment. Personally, I use separate binders for each class but that’s just me. 

Figure out a good sleep schedule that works for you and stick to it. Don’t wake up at staggered times and go to bed at staggered times. There were countless times that I would have an 12pm class as my first one that day and sleep until 11:30 and then not want to go to bed until 1 or 2 the following night before I had an 8am the next day. Sleep is more important than you think.

Always print things out in advance. You don’t want printer problems to screw you over 15 minutes before you have to turn it in. Print it out ASAP to save yourself some stress. 

Never feel pressured into partying. If you want to go to a party, then by all means go. If it is not your thing, then don’t go. Just make sure that it will not be an inconvenience to your schoolwork. It is okay to say no to going to a party. I know many, many people that made partying their first priority and they dropped out by the start of the second semester. It’s important to have a good balance between fun and work. 

Go to class!! Just go. You don’t want to miss one and be out of the loop and have no idea what’s going on. If you have to miss one because you are sick or there are family issues going on, email your teacher or ask classmates to catch you up, maybe even bring you a copy of class work. You have unlimited resources to keep you caught up. 

In regard to the above paragraph, you are allotted a certain amount of classes that you can miss before you fail. Do not abuse these because I guarantee you that there will come a day where you really wish that you had a freebie to use but you used them all in the first two months. Just keep a couple in the reserves and use them wisely. 

And last but not least, do what YOU want to do. Do what makes YOU happy and what you feel is best for yourself. Don’t do things you don’t want to do because your friends are doing them. Don’t do something that you don’t want to do because your parents are forcing you to. Do what makes YOU happy. And while you may feel pressured from all sides to do things that don’t make you happy, in the end is that really a way to live your life? Constantly bending over backwards for something you don’t like? Be yourself. Do what you love. Be happy. College only lasts for so long so enjoy the time that you have there. 

Sincerely, 
Your neighborhood sophomore

549,1622493452.0,One of my favorite professors collapsed on exam day (May 28),"I remember everything. He was just at his computer and also working on stuff at his lectern.

I’ll never forget that scene. He was saying “I’m sorry for not telling you guys.” and other variations. I didn’t hear what he was saying because I ran straight to security begging for help. 

Once we got there, another prof told us the truth. He has pancreatic cancer and didn’t want to admit it. He’s 63, and pretty healthy. It kinda makes sense because he kept adjusting his suit jacket while teaching because he was developing stomach bloating. It’s been on my mind ever since. I’ll hopefully see him in the morning.

The appointment was regarding my low iron deficiency. Essentially, I was experiencing problems where I couldn't feel parts of my body when I woke up, and I would often wake up with a headache and feel confused. Therefore, I had to visit the doctor to address these issues. Since I was concerned about my health, I couldn't email my professor earlier to inform them about my situation. After spending three hours at the doctor's office for tests and examinations, I immediately emailed my professor. I explained that I couldn't take the exam due to the emergency doctor's appointment. However, my professor responded by saying that she couldn't offer any makeup opportunities and emphasized the importance of reading the syllabus. The syllabus only mentions that a student forgot to take the exam without considering the circumstances.

So I called my insurance provider, and they scheduled an appointment for me with a hospital, which I was able to complete in four days. My RT-PCR test revealed that I had covid.

Just curious if anyone has experienced anything similar, and if so, what was the outcome (though I hope no one else has been here). 

So, I *graduated* in spring. I was accepted to a grad program, moved across the country, and have been taking GRAD classes/working/conducting research all summer. 

I received an email this afternoon from my UG uni stating that I could apply for readmission and graduation, if I wanted to graduate in December. 

Say what?! 

It turns out, I had an incomplete (thanks to Covid) THAT WAS NEVER CHANGED. Mind you, this was a research course that was an elective (didn’t need it to graduate). The instructor turned in the grade after the deadline. 

Again, say what?!

Before finding out that a degree wasn’t granted, I contacted the uni asking why I haven’t received my diploma yet. They mentioned they were backordered and I wouldn’t receive until the end of summer. NEVER did anyone mention that I wouldn’t be awarded a degree.  

It’s likely my grad school won’t mind at all, and I’ll continue on like nothing happened, but my mind is blown right now. And I know the pandemic has really hit academia hard, but shit. Can’t a girl even graduate?!

573,1676833652.0,My roommate locked me out for an hour and a half after I showered,"Hey everyone!
You may remember me from a post from a few months ago, called “my roommate is about to make me fail my exams.”

I realized i forgot to update that post: basically my RA had a talk with us, which pissed my roommate off even MORE, and she started doing more microaggressions towards me. Now she likes to play her shows out loud all night and screams at me when I try to turn the lights off. I invested in a blackout eye mask and ear plugs, which have greatly helped. I was also told nothing much can be done, as she absolutely refuses to move, and I can’t move my stuff to any of the other dorms available, they’re all across campus and no one I know has a car.

I’ve been spending less and less time in the room and for some reason it’s pissing her off so badly. I was gonna just stick it out for the rest of the year, until today, when she locked me out of the room after a shower. I don’t bring my keys to the shower as she’s usually in there with the door unlocked, and I usually bring undergarments and a robe but no towels, as our room is directly across from the bathroom. I don’t think I’ve ever gotten so mad at someone in my life, nor do I think I’ve ever screamed that much in my life. She flat out told me that she hoped I got assaulted so I wouldn’t spend so much time out of the room. 

I feel so violated and disgusted. I immediately went straight to my RA and I’m meeting with my housing director tomorrow. I am going to try to find someone that can help me move, I’m done.",college

582,1695888804.0,HELP: My brother deleted four years of work,"I'm 22 and in my final quarter of college. About 2 and a half years ago, I got an iPad to start taking notes. I love it, both for the convenience of carrying one thing and for the organization it gives. A lot of my course material overlaps, so it makes it easier to have the notes in one place. I plan to go to grad school, so it'll be nice to reference them later should I need refreshers.

However, it goes to sh\*t when it comes to my brother. I love him, but he likes to play around on my devices (he has his own device, he just likes to use mine for whatever reason). Usually, he'll just look through photos or play music, but on a few occasions, I've left my iPad with the goodnotes app open. He thinks its a game and will scribble/erase all over them before I get the make a copy. Unfortunately, Goodnotes doesn't have a revision history feature so usually I'll just have to redo everything.

If I get mad or try to explain, it'll stick for a few minutes but it never stays. He's severely autistic, so he genuinely does not know any better. All he understands is that I'm mad at him or that he did something wrong, so he just cries. Then all I can do is hug him, point to the iPad, and shake my head ""No touching."" He'll understand for a minute, but he's incredibly OCD when it comes to his routine. So the next day he'll repeat the cycle, he just goes back to playing with my devices. I've updated his own device to have everything mine does, but he still uses my device.

After he deleted notes the night before a midterm (I went to go get a snack), I broke down. I completely changed the passcode and added a finger ID.

While I was out getting groceries, he security locked the shit. Everything online tells me I need to reset it to factory settings, but I don't know how many notes I've actually saved. So I don't want to reset it and delete everything. Also, it's been a while since I've updated the software so I'm unsure if that's up to date.

I don't know what to do. If there's a way to bypass the security access and open it so I can back it up, please let me know. If not, is there a way where I can make good notes require a PIN code to access it every time I open the app? That way he can still play on it, but my notes will still be safe? Or a way to disable the ""too many attempted failures"" feature?

It's really shitty I got to do this in the first place, but I don't know what else I can do. As much as he drives me up the wall, I still love my brother. So I got to work around it I guess

**TDLR: my bro keeps deleting my notes in Goodnotes. I changed my password and he security locked my un-backed-up ipad. Everything online tells me I have to reset it completely to reuse it again. Can I bypass it to back it up before resetting, or am i fucked entirely?**

It’s my first year as an RA and I’ve had trouble with many people in my building but nothing like this night. So to begin the story i had been hanging out on another floor in another RAs room. I’m on duty this night because it’s my usual duty night. So as I’m hanging out with the other RA in their room I hear a loud noice in the hallway and I come out to see what’s going on? As I leave out I see this guy with a whole mattress he had stolen from another room walking down the hallway. When he gets back to his room he slams the door and begins screaming at himself. He’s clearly drunk and can’t comprehend what’s going on. So me and another RA attempt to get him to take the mattress back and and go sleep the alcohol off. Eventually we get him to take the mattress back to the room it came from. Now he’s walking down the hallways trying to hug us to try and I guess make things right. He suddenly spots a random kid on his ways back to his room and attempts to punch him. We stop him and call the cops who come and give him a citation. He’s begging and pleading with the cops asking why this has to happen but the still give him the citation and tell him to go to bed because if they have to come back he’s going to jail. So he goes in his room for 15 minutes before coming back out and hurling insults at one RA. He then goes back to his room and slams his door so hard the lock breaks. We call the cops again and when they show up he gets tackled and arrested he resist the entire way down to the point where 6 cops have to take him downstairs and put him in a car where he is taken to spend the night in jail. This is 2 days before spring breaks start for our school. 

When we returned from spring break a week later I’m at my desk shift At night when he approaches me asking why I called the cops on him that night. When I refused to say I was at fault he left calling me a “fucking coward”. The next day at my weekly meeting with my coworkers I tell my boss to cover my butt if he ever attacks me or try’s to. I find out during this meeting that he was on probation and had to attend weekly meeting with my boss for the rest of the semester or be expelled.

My dorm room isn't particularly bad or anything, but no matter what I do it just doesn't feel like home.  A common answer when I looked up this was just to decorate and stuff and even when I do that I still hate it.  Even among posters and lights and rugs, it's still a very very barebones room.

Part of it is definitely that it doesn't really feel like there's a clear separation between school and living.  Like even after all my stuff is done I still live at my college which means it's hard to really feel like I get a break.  Also, the dorms, at least at my uni, are all quite loud and filled with hordes of partying freshmen.  It legitimately feels like I'm living at the zoo with how hectic it is, and compared to off-campus apartments/houses that I've visited, it's way more severe in a dorm.

I also don't really have the ability to cook my own food or even store food that's not candy or bags of chips.  There is the dining hall, obv, but it doesn't really feel the same.  This is obviously a very trivial complaint but I like having control over what I eat and the ability to actually cook and eat healthy meals.

I'm lucky enough that next year I'll be living off-campus in an apartment of my own, and I'll be able to have a far more normal life.  And next semester there's a chance that I'll be able to get into a nicer, quieter, dorm as well.

594,1566577453.0,A Former Student’s Top Tips for College,"As a recent graduate and with many people starting college on Monday, I thought I would pass on some tips that helped me throughout my studies. These are some tips I really haven’t seen mentioned before and although some of these tips may not be applicable to everyone, they sure helped me out. 

1. Network as many people as you can to and go out of your way to help people. 

I would say I talked to about 50% of the people in my classes (about class size of 40) and got to know about 5 people from each class really well. When I had a question about homework I always had someone to ask and when people asked me a question I tried my best to answer. I would even used my tablet to make a step by step example to help them understand the topic better. When I graduated I got multiple jobs interviews/offers because people knew the type of person I was and recommended me for the job at the company they worked for. 

2. Talk to your professors and show them what type of student your are. 

Put in the extra effort into studying for your tests and completing your projects. Spend that extra time in creating your presentation and attempting to have the best results for the project possible. Let me tell you professors recognize this and when they need someone to help with their research they may turn to you. I had a couple of professors approach me during my senior year offering me a job working for them along with PAYING FOR MY MASTERS DEGREE. I know this may not be true for some majors but for some it is. 

3. Learn to read PDFs on your computer. 

I didn’t buy a college text book in 4 of the 5 years I was in college (sophomore year throughout my masters) because I either found PDFs online or was given them by other students (this is where networking and going out of your way to help others comes back around). The last book I bought was a chemistry book and the only reason I bought that was because I had to have the online access code (such a rip off). Some of the books were the previous edition but the information in them was still 95% the same. The only thing that was altered was the example and homework problems. 

4. Make a study guide that summarizes all of the important topics with worked out example problems for every course relative to your major. 

Right before every test I made a short summary guide of every major topic that would be on that test along with a few worked out examples. Many of my courses called for knowledge from a previous course and I used this study guide to quickly/ easily remember those topics. I also used this guide to study for my job interviews. You will be thankful for this when the person interviewing you makes you solve problems on the white board 

5. Find out where your department staff is and always be friendly with them. 

Over the first two years I got to know the office staff of my department and every time they had leftover food from meetings they would let me know. I got a free lunch one to three times a week from this. 


I hope this helps you out some and if you would like me to further explain just let me know!


Edit: Many people are asking me through on and commenting about how to network. I was/am an extremely introverted person that enjoys being alone at times. To show how introverted I am here is a story: I didn’t like talking to people so much that in my first semester I would eat my lunch in my truck. Well one day a guy from my calculus class saw me and came to my truck and started talking to me. The day after he found me again and did the same thing. The third day I park in the parking lot across campus so I could eat lunch alone again. Fast forward 5 years and I actually have a great job because of this guy.

So here is how I did it.  At the start of my sophomore year I started small by sitting in the front row next to people that were actually engaged in the class and I would ask them how their weekend was or how their other classes were going. After I got to know them the first couple of weeks I would ask them if they would like to stay after to work on the homework or study for the test. Then I would invite them to go to lunch or dinner. I found a common interest with some of them and did that with them. This is a long story but in summary one guy and I played ping pong in the rec every Tuesday my junior year.  He became one of my best college friends and we now talk every week even though he is 10 states away. Also when you are in group projects pull you weight and step up. People remember this and will want to work with you again. This is how I began to network. I hope this helps some.",college

What am I supposed to do in this situation?

EDIT to add: I mentioned this in one of my comments but i’m especially confused about this because the professor isn’t supposed to input any homework grades manually. All of our homework assignments are done on a different website. We answer questions and read about course material on a separate website and upon completing each module the grades are transferred from the website directly to our grade book so I’m not entirely sure why it ended up as a 11/1 since my professor doesn’t enter the grades herself.

He doesn’t have lesson plans; he doesn’t have a syllabus; he doesn’t record and post his lectures online like every other instructor/prof at the school; he doesn’t answer email; it’s unbelievably bad.

We’ve had ONE graded assignment in 2 months of class and the assignment used multiple concepts that aren’t in our textbook that haven’t been taught in-class. The class average is 49%. The one assignment was due 9/24 and we didn’t get it back until today, 10/19. The withdrawal deadline is only 8 days away, no refunds of course. ~70% of the class has a failing grade. The instructor said verbatim that there will be no grade curve on anything in the course. 

The guy’s lectures are him holding a 2L of Diet Coke while he rambles about his personal and work history. He’ll tell us a story about how statistics apply to reporting the weather or something else totally unrelated to what we’re supposed to be learning. Sometimes he’ll show us how to solve some complicated statistics problem that has close to no basis or no basis at all to what’s in our textbook; the class just stares at him with glazed over eyes because we’re all thinking “how the hell are we supposed to follow any of this”. We haven’t been introduced to any formulas, vocabulary, or anything meaningful. 

I emailed the department head once and the head got him to post a barebones syllabus on Canvas but there’s been no other improvement. 

I feel like I’ve been scammed out of $1200 and a W on my transcript will look pretty bad.

I don't even feel like a progressive young adult woman, because I'm not studying natural sciences.

I’m mostly in asynchronous courses so I don’t have to worry about attendance, which  helps.

I also was really never effective in learning in class, I always had to do outside research and studying which is how I mostly learned my material, even since HS.

610,1597253630.0,I hate overly political professors,"To be clear: I'm not a political science or a humanities student. I know that politics are extremely important in those disciplines! I'm a STEM major, and am taking a Soil Science 101 class right now. The second that class starts, the professor complains about having to use a plexiglass divider and proceeds to NOT USE IT. And he said that he hates masks and if my college didn't require it, he'd snatch it off! He also proceeded to say that the USA has done more for the environment than any other country. He kept sprinkling in his conservative politics to all of the things he discussed. It drove me nuts. 

Also, on the ""optional reading"" page on Moodle, there's an article about socialism being bad. He's a soil science professor! Why is it necessary to put all of your political convictions (which are bigoted and dangerous in this era of COVID) out in the open? This is going to be a fun semester.

UPDATE: I filed a complaint to the dean's office yesterday. Today when I went into class, he used the plexiglass protector and did not complain about the mask at all. I don't know if it had anything to do with my complaint, but I'm quite happy nonetheless. He still voices his political opinions in class, but that's okay as long as he takes measures against COVID.

617,1599309698.0,To those wondering what it is like to go to a university THAT HAS NOT SHUT DOWN,"Let me start by saying  I have yet to get sick, but I have had to move locations the past month due to people around me becoming infected.

For sake of anonymity, I will not disclose my school directly. I will say I attend a college in Virginia that is currently getting hit hard with rona, and is a hot spot zone.  The most common thing I have seen people blame is that it’s people partying. Yes that is a factor but I will list all the things I have seen on campus.

1) No mask enforcement, even though they market that they are mandated on campus.
  You can walk on campus and  if people do not have masks on, they are wearing them incorrectly. I witnessed a girl with a mask below her nose ,sneeze and not cover her nose.

2) Buildings do not enforce policies
   I worked in a public area on campus and many  times students would overcrowd elevators, take off masks before they left the building, and come when they were sick. 

3) staff and professors did not follow procedures 
Students are not the only one to blame. I would say that as many students that were not following procedures, staff and faculty were not either. On my first day back, a professor and student stood in-front of the library door talking less than 6 feet apart ( no masks on) and you literally had to go in between them to get into the building.

4) The administration has their head in the sand
 While you notice everything wrong on campus you will continue to get  emails saying how great everything is. In a recent email , our president said that this outbreak was expected and it is coming to a head. They also said we have no evidence of community transmission on campus(blaming off campus students), even though positive COVID cases make up 3/4 of the county positive results.

5) Not enough testing is being done
 Our university has a COVID dashboard and anyone with basic understanding of statistics will see how skewed the data is. They only tested kids coming from hot spots and just recently have held mass testing for willing individuals. They only update the information once a week. I was tested on a Friday and did not receive my results until that next Thursday, a day AFTER the university updated their weekly stats.(may just be a conspiracy I have).

6) You can do everything right but it doesn’t matter if those around you aren’t.
I live with a roommate who doesn’t take COVID seriously. They think because they are young and “ Never get sick”, they shouldn’t worry. I did everything right and because others don’t take it as seriously, you will be affected.

7) Faculty are struggling 
Professors are having a hard time teaching in this environment. I am very close with one of my professors and they relayed to me how stressful all this has been, especially being an older population and having vulnerable parents at home.

At this point I don’t know if we will shut down. I think it will take everyone overloading the isolation dorms or someone dying. The administration is full steam ahead...",college

Last week we had a computer science assignment due that we both forgot about until he looked at the course page and realized it was due at 11:59 which was in half in hour. We both busted our laptops out and wrote the code as fast as possible and finished around the same time... 12:01. frantic and not wanted to get stuck with a zero we both sent separate emails to our professor with the files attached. The fact that we did this assignment so quickly is an important detail to me because it means there is no way we could have worked together and still get done so fast. 

Fast forward to today, about a week later. This morning she replied to the email finally and asked us to come her at her office hours. my roommate had a class so I went alone. My professor accused me of plagiarism citing that our code was too similar, we made the same mistakes, and we both tried to turn them in late, around the same time. I tried fighting for my case but of course she was very dismissive and at one point laughed at me. She tried getting me to sign off on a paper that would be sent to the office of student conduct but I refused and wanted to consider my options before admitting to something I didn't do, so I have to go to her office hours again on Monday. and that brings us to right now. I don't know how to prove that I didn't cheat and I'm worried about suffering consequences that I don't deserve. Any advice would be much appreciated right now.

628,1683716961.0,Given a 0 on a significant grade for using Grammarly,"So in April, I had to write a Synthesis essay for my entirely online English class. The essay was about 10% of my overall grade. I turned it in on time, but when it got graded last week, I had received a 0, and the teacher's feedback said ai use had been detected and that I needed to email her. I emailed her and asked to schedule an in-person meeting, but I had to settle on a phone call because she wasn't available. I called her two days ago (The first communication other than email I've made) and explained that I didn't use any ai and explained my process and drafts for my paper, which I stated I had written on Grammarly.

&#x200B;

After this, she said she didn't think I used ai, but that I was admitting to using Grammarly to help write my papers, which is cheating as per the academic dishonesty policy. I explained that all Grammarly does is help fix spelling and grammar and that it isn't different from Word's built-in spell check, and all she said was that she was familiar with Grammarly and felt the grade was appropriate.

&#x200B;

I have been using Grammarly with no issues, and at the advisement of my teachers for several years now, and nothing in her syllabus or any other documents say anything against using Grammarly. I currently have a 4.0 GPA, and I had a 99 in this class before this assignment, but now my grade is an 84. Even if I were to get 100s on all my assignments left in the class, I would still finish with an 89.37.

&#x200B;

I was unaware that using Grammarly wasn't allowed since it doesn't say that anywhere in her class. I asked her if I could rewrite the assignment, and she said no, and I'm pretty sure this is going on my permanent record as cheating. Should I try to fight this with the dean or just give up?

I got zero feedback on my actual responses, which honestly is a little infuriating.

I just went from a 1.2 gpa during my freshman year to a 3.0 this semester (first semester of my sophomore year).  

I was always one of those kids that was in gifted and talented  and never studied, but university hit me like a ton of bricks.  High school was an absolute breeze for me; so much so that I never really learned HOW to study. Fast forward to college, and I’m the type of student that never studied/cared about classes too much, and that resulted in me being forced to leave my university due to not meeting SAP.

I’m attending a community college online this semester (while working full-time at a grocery store), and have managed to get a 3.0. I’m absolutely ecstatic rn honestly.

I’m posting this to say that, if anybody else is currently in that position that I was in, it’s NOT the end of the world. You CAN improve your grades. You decided your own outcome in college, so please don’t squander it. Don’t come this far just to miss the mark because of procrastination/lack of effort.

663,1638319810.0,EXAM TAKING TIPS (take 'em or leave 'em),"Prof here -- I don't know how helpful this will be, but I thought I'd give a few tips for folks that are nervous about taking finals for the first time.

Just like my other advice, this is science-based.  Because all that feel-good vibes stuff drives me nuts. 

**1.)  IF YOU HAVE TO ""CRAM"" DON'T DO IT THE NIGHT BEFORE.**   For instance, if you have only 3 days to study, breaking it into 2 hours per day per subject is way better than doing 6 straight hours the night before.

**2.) ANKI IS YOUR FRIEND.**  Make the cards now, it's a fantastic way to memorize --but if you don't understand your flashcards, don't bother.  This is a memorizing thing (great for languages or formulas)  [https://apps.ankiweb.net/](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)

**3.) MEMORY DEVICES:**

You might have heard of **PEMDAS** (P*arentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction*) make a word out of first letters.  If it doesn't make a word, make a sentence like...

  ""**K**eep **P**ots **C**lean, **O**r **F**amily **G**ets **S**ick"" for the taxonomy order of *Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species""* or if you're a scuba diver ""**B**ruce **W**illis **R**uins **A**ll **F**ilms"" for *""BCD, Weights, Releases, Final Check""*

**4.) CALMING DOWN:**   Here's something I learned from freediving.  If you find yourself going into a major panic, you need to lower your heart rate.  You need to get it as slow as you can.  Now, a lot of folks achieve that through yoga/meditation.  I can't do that.  It just doesn't work for me.  It's too slow and I'm too distracted.  So I had to learn the scientifically proven heart rate lowering hack:

1) Exhale for the count of 8... (this is hard).  A full slow count of 8, so almost a full 8 seconds.  Not a fast 12345678, but 1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8 

2) Hold breath for 2 seconds

   3) Inhale deeply for 2 seconds

   4) Hold breath for 2 seconds

Repeat starting at one.  If you don't believe it works, read this article about how some freediver's breathing can allow them to lower their heartbeat to the point where they can stay underwater for 7 minutes.  [https://theconsciousclub.com/articles/the-art-of-holding-your-breath-exploring-the-freediving-breathing-technique](https://theconsciousclub.com/articles/the-art-of-holding-your-breath-exploring-the-freediving-breathing-technique)  They do it using the breathing exercise, then going into deep cold water (which has to do with the mammalian dive reflex which you can't do unless your exam is underwater.)  

**5.) GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP:**   *Tell your roommate to shut the fuck up.*  A good night's sleep is CRITICAL.   This is another reason you shouldn't cram the night before.  Your brain actually absorbs some stuff during sleep.  

**6.) SKIM THE EXAM BEFORE YOU START ANSWERING QUESTIONS:**  I always suggest this to students, and then some of them don't take it.   So what happens?  They spend a half-hour working on a question they don't really know the answer to, and then run out of time -- and they aren't able to get to the questions that they absolutely do know the answers to.  Answer the questions you can ace FIRST. Then go back and tackle the others.

**7.) WAKE UP EARLY.**  Rushing to class gets your heart rate up.  When your heart rate is up, you are more likely to panic.  When you panic, you are more likely to second guess yourself and more likely to make a mistake.  (again, ask any scuba diver.)

**8.) EAT BREAKFAST IF YOU USUALLY EAT BREAKFAST.**   I know some people who just can't eat breakfast early.   But you don't want to be hungry during an exam.

**9.) ONLY USE STUDY GROUPS WITH PEOPLE WHO GIVE A SHIT.**   I remember this from when I was in college.  We'd schedule ""study groups"" and do nothing but eat pizza and bitch about classes.  That was only until I did a study group with a roommate that was pre-med.  We were studying totally different things, but she'd give me flashcards, and I'd ask her questions, then I'd give her my flashcards and she'd ask me questions.   What really worked about that was that if I tried to give some bullshit explanation on one of my computer science answers she'd have no idea what I was talking about and would say... I don't know if that's the same as what's on here.   Ditto with her pre-med questions.  If she wasn't able to explain the answer in a clear way that I could understand as a non-premed student she knew she needed to work on it.   But with some of my friends, it wasn't so much of a study group as it was a pizza party with textbooks open.  

**10.) READ THE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS!   READ THE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS!   READ THE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS!   READ THEM BACKWARDS IF YOU HAVE TO!**    I can't tell you how many of my really good students lose points because they didn't read carefully.   And they aren't trick questions!   I'll write something like ""Give two examples of scene transitions that do X"" and they'll list one.   The reason?  They just saw ""Give... transition.... do X"".   And boom - they lose 5 points on a 10 point question.

**FINALLY -- IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.**  This exam does not determine whether or not you get cancer.  It is not worth beating yourself up for.  Work your hardest to pass it, but if you can't -- I promise you that it's not the end of the world.  You're not a bad person because you failed an exam.  You're not going to get disowned. I promise that you're going to be okay.   Your career is a marathon -- if you slow down and don't do great on one mile, that's fine.  You've got 25 other miles to prove you're a hard worker.",college

Other people told me they've also been kicked out by this prof for being two minutes late. I also heard that the prof is trying to change her syllabus to include her new late policy (I don't think it was in the syllabus) so honestly screw that. It's literally community college.

Thanks for the advice everyone. 

Basically I didn't read between the lines about the attendance policy and should have known that ""best possible steps to take"" means that she could fail me... Also I should have gone and talked to her after the 4th absence, but I didn't.

So what I'm going to do now is try and hold out until Dec 12 and prioritize getting to this class... 

&#x200B;

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Original post:

I already talked with the prof about this. Prof does not grade attendance. Prof says ""if you don’t come to class (from now on), an F will be the only possible grade, unless you decide to withdraw. To my mind, a student who, at the beginning of October has 7 absences, has missed too many classes.""7 is probably too many, and I thought Prof graded attendance and was going to take the low grade for that... Attendance is still kept in record and I have a 42% but it doesn't actually count toward the final grade.

Even though I still have SOME attendance, prof said my work is ""excellent,"" AND I have an A in all assignments and tests/quizzes, prof says they will fail me... :)

ALSO university policy says I should attend class but that it is up to the prof to decide policy and it should be on the syllabus (which it was not...) Only thing on the syllabus about attendance was "" Students are allowed four absences during the semester. If students will miss more than four classes, the students have to report to the teacher as soon as possible to discuss the best steps to take to move forward."" and no grade penalties were ever mentioned.

Also the reason I don't go and am willing to take the fall is because I am a HS senior trying to balance work, school, 5 college classes, one HS class, and social life... I also struggle w/ depression and anxiety and most days I can't afford to drain my battery on a lecture that I don't need.

Basically what do I do to fix it and is it fixable? I don't want to escalate.

&#x200B;

EDIT:

So these are not my first college classes... again I was prepared to take the zero grade for attendance (but it was my bad bc she doesn't actually grade attendance when I thought she did)

&#x200B;

I have done this in all of my other college courses and I have As in the rest of my classes too...

&#x200B;

I know 7 absences is too many and the prof reserves the right to say that its too many... The problem is the penalty which I was not made aware of and the fact that prof says they ""don't grade attendance"" when attendance apparently does directly impact my grades for assignments the rest of the semester.

I keep up with all slideshows and course content and I am not struggling to produce work. I mentioned I am in HS because I have one morning class at my HS that is at the same time as this class so I don't come all the time bc of that too.... I'm just wondering how I should talk to prof and what to do so I can continue doing the work & get the grades I earn without an automatic fail bc of low attendance.

Semester is ending and you're about to move on and forget your current professors.  Somebody else still needs to take the course you you just finished.  Pass on what you learned.

This matters.  When I go to register for classes, I check my professors ratings.  If there are 3 or less ratings, then it's useless to me.

Eventually, when correcting, my professor realized that both my code and theirs was nearly identical, so, this professor gave us both a 0. 

Thankfully, my friend admitted to copying me very quickly and explained that I did all of the work. 

Later on, my professor replied to us explaining that they advised for us to not share our code with each other since it can lead to similar situations (as said earlier in the semester) and because of this, she’ll leave the grades as is. 

I apologized to her for the mistake that I did, pleaded for her to at least only penalize me for the small section of the code that was plagiarized or only give me half a credit on the work.

I'm still considered a SOPHOMORE at my age, and it's extremely frustrating when everyone else is graduating with their masters at 24!

My biggest issue is that I used to take two courses per semester because I have ADHD, and get side-tracked so easily. I go from studying to thinking about what I should eat for lunch, and my mind goes on an adventure. Next thing you know, two hours have passed, and I didn't get anything done.

Full-time semesters are HELL for me, and I recently changed majors from nursing to software engineering. The only way I can get out of college on time is if I tackle full-time semesters instead of just two courses, but how on earth are people surviving 12+ credits when they're dealing with calculus and upper level programming/engineering classes?? How do you manage to not fail taking these overwhelming classes all at once?

I should add that I am not getting any professional help for my ADHD.

Another HUGE issue of mine is insomnia. It’s currently 4:18 AM, and I can’t sleep (this is the norm). I have constant racing thoughts, and it leads to day time drowsiness.

All of the transfer students were significantly older than me (like, old enough to be my parents old). I got stares for coming by myself (but mostly from parents who'd brought along their kids), and when I said I was from CC, they just started staring more.

At another uni I was planning to go to (but did not because aforementioned uni accepted me), they had a session for those who'd been accepted to that major, and when I told the other students I was from community college, their jaws quite literally dropped and they were like ""Ur FrOm CoMmUnIty CoLlEge???"" and everything. Like...isn't it good to save money? Good thing I'm not going to that uni!

Since my uni requires a full-time semester GPA at the uni before applying to my major's actual program, I haven't gotten an Associate's yet (am one semester away from doing so, plan to finish it if I get rejected from my major's actual program). So just a bunch of credits from my cc.

Thursday. Even my bank account is overdrafted.

705,1604078334.0,Professor won’t allow me to make-up a midterm?,"So I had a midterm this week and got in a serious car accident the day before. (the midterm was only open during the day it was due.) I was unable to do the exam, and in the course syllabus it states, “Make-up tests are given only if there is solid evidence of a medical or otherwise serious emergency that prevented the student from taking the exam”. I wrote her an email stating my situation and offered to provide all documentation as necessary. My professor replied that since they went over the test during the following day’s lecture, there is nothing I can do to make it up. 

My grade went from an 85 to a 51. 

EDIT 1: So I should probably clear this up. I emailed the professor before the test was due, and she didn’t respond. Then I followed up after the test was due. I also didn’t make it to class where they reviewed the test, but the lectures are recorded so technically I could go look at the answers at any time.

EDIT 2: Some of you are asking for the exact wording from my professor so here it is. The first email I sent, several hours BEFORE the test was due was where I explained my situation and stated that I would be unable to take the test on the given date and asked if I can make it up. To this I got no response. Then I sent a second email the next day asking again if I can make up the test in some way, as the syllabus says I should be allowed to. Professor replied to my email with, “No you can not make up the test. The solutions were covered in class. Thank you.”

Hope this clears the confusion.

On my first day of class this past week I had my Microbiology professor say some things I consider to be really unprofessional.  
  
First, as he begins his introduction he pauses to ask me and another student (we are seated in the front row) if it was okay if he didn't have his mask on while he was in the front of the class (which is JUST barely 6 feet away). He said he already cleared it with the Administration and as long as we were okay with it they would allow it.  
  
Then he goes into a spiel about how masks are pointless because they don't work; virus' are too small to be blocked by masks. When I questioned him on why would they mandate it if it didn't work he went into it about how Fauci is an idiot who was out of touch with reality and hasn't worked as a clinician since his residency many years ago.  
  
He also mentioned he got COVID-19 last January though I find that odd because I don't even think they were testing for COVID-19 at that point last year in the US.  
  
He then ends it with saying the only way to get over this mess that is COVID is herd immunity.  
  
Of course it's my fault for not speaking up right away, I just found it hard to when the whole class agreed immediately. I have a bit of social anxiety. But I do find all the things he said to be unprofessional. I know professors are human and can have opinions but I'm really put off by him asking if we would be ok with him taking his mask off.  
  
I'm looking for any advice on what to do in this situation or if anyone has been in a similar predicament. I'm weary of approaching I guess cause of my grades since he has control of them. Not sayin he would do anything but bias' are a real thing.

Last-minute students - is there anything your instructors can do to help you? Or is this a lost cause?

*UPDATE:*

*Thank you all for your thoughtful feedback. I knew that students lived a stressful life, but I didn't realize just how bad it is. You have my sympathy!*

*For what it's worth, I've observed the same behaviour in traditional, in-person labs. We had a lab that used to be two hours long, and students would just barely get it done in time. We expanded the lab to three hours, without changing any of the content. Students still barely got it done in time. I'd wager that I could make the same lab 1 hour or 4 hours, and nothing would change. Whenever you give a deadline, students will just barely meet it.*

*This is why I'm wary of suggestions to break a lab into pieces, each with their own deadline. If students are struggling to meet one deadline, then making them meet three deadlines doesn't help.*

721,1681957399.0,I got my grade in my upper division art class changed from a low D- to a 94% by asking my professor to explain his reasoning on my project scores.,"I have received 10-20% credit on every major project in this course despite following all the rubrics and project guidelines and including everything required. I thought it was a bit weird to get scores this low since I had put in a lot of time and effort for each assignment and handed them in on time, and usually a score below 50% means you didn’t even complete the work. Today I finally spoke up and made the professor literally read every one of his own rubrics and project guidelines and then pointed out how i had hit every point on them on my work like I was explaining something to a 4 year old. He admitted there wasn’t actually anything wrong with my work and changed all my grades which took about 2 minutes. I’ve emailed him and asked for feedback on how I can improve so many times this semester without getting a response, and he has never left a single submission comment or piece of critique on my online submissions for the class. He was pretty pissed that I caught him just entering random numbers for my grade but it’s like come on I’m literally paying 30k$ a year and this guy barely lectures or teaches for 20 minutes of his 3 hour class, so the least he could do is give me a passing grade.

I’m honestly so over the terrible professors at my university, this is my final semester at college and the average professor won’t respond to emails or hold office hours, and a lot honestly seem to have a real contempt for students trying to get an actual education. This professor literally screamed at a girl and made her cry earlier this week for submitting the wrong file type. 

Obviously there are also great professors but they are few and far between at least in my major. I only have two teachers this semester that seem like they’re trying to teach something and are willing to talk to me outside of class. It’s just a struggle having to go through a bunch of extra nonsense and deal with weird teachers on power trips to get a degree.

724,1700613329.0,Professor emailed me in regards to my rate professor rating.,"Basically long story short, I have been sick and this has caused me to fall behind in some of my classes. I emailed all of my professors in regards to me being sick and provided a pretty generic doctors note just stating I have been under a doctors care. This was no issue for most of my professors except for one. Of course, it was the professor teaching the fully online elective course. He basically stated that the doctors note wasn’t enough to make up any assignment because the date had to be the whole week the assignment was open. So I pretty much just gave up on trying to make up any assignments in his class and just accepted that I’m going to do the best I can from here on out. But I did leave a rate my professor review just to warn other students that this professor is not going to work with you on life events and he is difficult. Well, two days later the professor reaches out to me via email basically asking if I left a rate professor review and how if I did it’s no hard feelings but everything I stated was basically untrue and I’m the only student with current health issues going on that’s why he knew it was me. It’s was a three paragraph long message discussing this rate my professor review. So obviously I told him it DEFINITELY WAS NOT ME and asked again if I could make up the assignments with my doctors note. He responded yes but from here on out I need to contact the SSD office. But I’m highly concerned about retaliation from here on out. I’m not sure how to handle a situation like this and I am looking for advice.

725,1661900536.0,I am proud of myself,"Hey, I'm 39 years old I'm a single mom and I'm in my second semester of college. I am back in college approximately 20 years after I graduated high school. This might be silly, but I was proud of myself today. A little quick backstory. When I was a teenager, my mother married a very violent, felon and criminal. He would regularly beat us, terrorize us, and needless to say, it affected my education. I was kicked out of 7th grade, and had to go to another school. From the age of 12 to 19 years old, I never went to the doctor, the dentist, went clothes shopping, or had a haircut. By the time I was 19 years old my hair was way past my bottom almost touching the back of my knees. I also graduated high school living in a homeless shelter. My mother and her ex, were addicts, and teenage years were absolutely horrible. I regularly read books from a very young age, so I had a healthy vocabulary, I was articulate and I knew how to spell very well. Anyway, my math education was lacking. Math is very formulaic, and I always had difficulty with it. Last semester, I got all A's, and this semester I just started taking career math. Today was my first day. These past couple months I went on Khan Academy to freshen up for math class. While in class today, the professor put a problem up on the board. A division sign, a minus sign and some parentheses. He asked the class for the answer, no one knew what it was. Because I practiced so much these past few months, I raised my hand and told him the answer. I found out that I was right, and he asked why, I said that parentheses means multiplication. It's really silly, but I felt proud of myself today. I've never been able to raise my hand in a math class and give a right answer, and the reasoning behind it. No matter what background you come from, you can do it.

732,1681454995.0,Did I overreact about people having sex in the shower?,"Sorry for the long post in advance and I didn’t know if this was the right flair. I’m tired 🥲

I have been living in the same dorm hall since I was a freshman and when we have orientation, the staff always say “don’t have sex in the showers. It’s uncomfortable for other residents who also have to use that bathroom”. I’m a senior now and there hasn’t been any issues. 

I currently live in a room that shares a wall with the shower so I can hear when people start the shower or play music. Most of the time it’s relaxing as just white noise so never really had an issue. 

For the past 2-3 weeks there have been multiple instances of people using the shower as the sexy time spot. If this were a gender neutral bathroom and it was private in a sense that u had your own room. Probably wouldn’t care as much. 

 I have gone in to brush my teeth and the shower was going and I heard a dude in the shower with a girl, I just left and walked to the other bathroom down the hall. When I came back into my room I can hear them having sex. So I just put my headphones in and just try to forget about it. 

I’m in the bathroom and two people go in to the shower (I’m guessing they didn’t know I was there and I didn’t recognize it was 2 of them) until they start doing the thing. That’s when I just got up and left. Again frustrated but moved on. 

But within the past week there were multiple instances and it’s really becoming increasingly difficult to not say anything. Especially when this hasn’t been an issue before and I’m just trying to chill in my room and not hear other people’s sex experiences. 

Tonight I’m doing laundry and the same thing happens when I come back upstairs from doing the first load. It’s like 12:30pm and I talked to some of my friends about it before and they said I should talk to my RA/SRA. Luckily she was on duty. She is also my friend. I explain the situation and she agreed that it was uncomfortable and inappropriate. 

She did her RA duties and said she was gonna contact the RD about it to send out an email reminder to the building and that was the end. 

Until later when I’m finally finished at 2 am. So I just went and opened the door and said “people can hear you and this is a public bathroom for the people who live in this wing. It’s really uncomfortable to hear what’s going on” (not verbatim as I’m tired and over it) then I put up a sign that basically says the same thing (the SRA suggested it). After that they stopped at least with the noise as it’s also I was able to just chill and here we are. 

I just wanted to know if I was being unreasonable. As a college student myself sometimes u just gotta get it 🙃. But at the same time they aren’t gender neutral bathrooms and you can hear the noise most of the time which is uncomfortable when u go to wash ur hands or writing a paper.

Because I changed my mind during my senior year, it was obviously too late to switch my major. And I'm realizing that, my degree isn't so useful outside of academia. It's not getting me a single job offer or not even an interview, and McDonald's pays more than my current research job in astrophysics. Has anyone had a similar experience? That is, realizing that you don't wanna stay in the field of your major too late, and you can't switch your major nor get a decent job with the degree you're getting. It doesn't have to be in physics, obviously.

I stopped texting for a while, and he sent multiple messages asking where I was and if I was okay. I just felt weird. He texted me a couple weeks later and asked if we could talk about the project, and I said okay.

Everyone in the groupchat who asks questions about homework and actually puts in effort, has grades in the 30-40 range.  

Fuck this.

Update for clarification:

So essentially, the first midterm was adjusted because some of the questions were wrong, so everyone got 30 extra points. I didn't think that the class average was after the adjustment (even though it's pretty obvious now that I think of it) so the class average was a 70 and I got an 80. The curve is added after the class so I have a lot of reasons to be optimistic.

All the answers for the first test were on the internet and chegg. Essentially working through the problem with just 1 number changed. So a lot of people probably cheated. You do not have to show any work  and grades are just based off the answers. The first test was just 5 really long questions. It's not a great format imo. 

I have another midtern soon and hopefully all the answers won't be on chegg like last time. I'm just gonna take it without chegg and hope for the best.",college

Seriously, every professor I’ve seen do this always cites a study that information is retained better when hand written.

Students can write less by hand and thus miss information trying to keep up. 

Assignments are turned in electronically anyway so it is easier to use the same medium for everything.

It’s like every professor I’ve seen do this is trying to signal some level of higher moral compass by saying, “I know what learning method/medium is better for you than you know for yourself”.

757,1622731062.0,My mom threatened to not pay for college if she can’t track me.,"Not sure if this is the right place to post this but I needed advice. I told my mom she can’t track me in college and she immediately asked me “what are you going to be doing that I can’t know about????”. I have never done anything. Like seriously ANYTHING. I have no friends, have never gone to a party, haven’t had a sleep over since the 9th grade, never snuck out, never been in a wreck, never underage drank without them knowing and never done anything ever. But she still tracks me on Life360. She then asked “well do you want me calling and texting you all the time?”  She already does this WITH the tracking. She threatened to take my car, take my phone, and not pay for room and board (I got tuition and fees paid for). She is overly cautious of everything and the type that goes to bed at 8 pm. I’m careful but she just plain out doesn’t do anything ever and has no desire to ever. I know it’s downtown Birmingham and it’s dangerous but roommates track roommates! And friends track friends. I don’t want to do anything crazy in college, I just want to be able to go out without my mommy knowing my every move. Is she being ridiculous or me?

UPDATE: Wow! I am so surprised and honored so many of you cared about me and my situation to respond to me😭 and I got two hugging bear awards??! I’ve read about half of the comments so far and y’all have suggested everything from softwares, burner phones, sucking it up, going out anyways, a heart to heart, paying for my own stuff, loans, and everything in between. And some suggesting my mother may even be right. 

To clarify some things: I am 18, I will be 19 this year, I have a job but I just can’t make enough to support myself yet, my DAD (who I don’t think anyone has considered yet) is partially on my side, Birmingham is dangerous but my mom is especially scared bc she is not from the city. 

My mother is controlling and overly cautious of everything. She is toxic but I don’t believe her to be “abusive” (maybe that’s just the language of the abused though). She also 1000% has anxiety as someone suggested. I understand why she wants to track me, I really do. But I just want to go out to eat with friends without her asking me who I am with, when we will be back, how is Sarah’s mom?, and what I ate...

I want more than anything to be independent. I acknowledge that I’m not yet (and it kills me). I make $8.50 an hour and am trying to come up with another “side hustle” too. 

I appreciate you all. Thank you for making me not think I’m crazy (for once)💗",college
758,1696738851.0,"Graduated and walked, now I'm told I didn't graduate.","Not sure what to do from here. I graduated back in May and started applying for jobs over the summer so I ordered an official transcript when I noticed there's no indication I received my degree, so I emailed the office that handles diplomas and they responded that I have a hold preventing me from graduating. I checked my bursar and I owe $0.00, so I know it's not a financial hold. They responded and told me to email my advisor and check, so I did. I have 2 advisors because I minored in spanish, but my main advisor was horrible. She never responded to any of my emails and if she did it was two months later. So I assumed she was the issue, but I got an email over the weekend from my spanish advisor that I am 1 class short of graduating with a minor. Here's where the drama starts. I have 3 separate emails from this guy stating that studying abroad over the summer would complete my spanish minor because I was ""1 class short of graduating with a minor"" then. But here's the thing, I was in 18 hours last semester and the study abroad fulfilled 2 classes or 6 credit hours, so I dropped the class I was in for the spring and signed up for the summer study abroad. I have an email asking for confirmation that ""I'm one class short now, so if I drop my current course and do the study abroad I will complete my spanish minor since it counts for two elective courses, right?"", to which I have two separate emails stating ""Yes, the study abroad will complete the spanish minor"".  

So what happens now? I dropped like $3,000 for this study abroad just to be told I'm still one class short when I was told last spring that it would be enough to complete it. 

UPDATE: So my main advisor still has not responded (grr) but my Spanish advisor did respond to my email to him. I informed him of our previous messages and he emailed me back this morning saying he now sees the classes from over the summer and it WILL complete my minor. Woohoo.

Ah, you are about to enter college and have high hopes and dreams for what you are going to do in college. People tell you it will be the best 4 years of your life and you will make so many memories. Enjoy this time because you will never get it back in your life. Also, this is the phase in life where you should be experimenting and trying things because, after all, you have so much more freedom than you ever might have in your life (yeah right).  


You enter college and maybe a year goes by, and well, you just feel extremely letdown and intense FOMO.  


This pretty much sums up my freshman year. I had envisioned myself joining technical clubs, and social clubs, going to parties, and making lots of friends and memories. I had created this very high ""image"" of what I expected from my college life. This image and expectation had just led to disappointment as I wasn't able to achieve them.  


Making friends was replaced by low confidence, low self-esteem, and image issues. Joining clubs was replaced with anxiety about grades and schoolwork. Going to parties was replaced by being a horrible networker who couldn't meet people. Going to college events was replaced with fear of chaos. I think you get the point here.   


What contributes to this anxiety is when people emphasize how important it is to make friends, maybe get in relationships, network in clubs, and go to social events and how we will miss out on this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. For me, this created intense FOMO. I'd wake up and beat myself up for having less life experiences than others and this lack of experiences affected my confidence because I thought I was just boring. Whenever I see others having fun, I fear that I am missing out and I will never get this chance again.   


I thought I was alone until talking with other peers and reading so many Reddit posts about how people are worried about missing out. I think this whole idea of ""college life"" is just a narrative shoved down our throats but the reality is that like no one achieves this.   


Throughout this first year, I learned just how bad I am at meeting people and forming friendships and just experiencing life in general. The whole ""have fun in college"" just feels like a scam. I've decided I'm gonna completely tilt in the other direction next year. I'm gonna focus on building my ego and my skills. Basically set me up to be a successful person after graduating college. If I can't have experiences and friendships, I'd at least want to grind life, do good in college, and become successful.  


I wouldn't say this often, but I would encourage some of you who feel stuck in a similar way to do something similar. Go grind at the gym and get a body. get a high GPA. start a club/business project because frankly, my ego and drive is the only thing I have faith in at this point.",college

766,1571526145.0,My roommate rarely leaves the room,"So this is one of those complaints that really does get the response ""Suck it up, everyone gets bad roommates,"" but I'm about to lose my mind. I can generally handle roommates from hell. I'm a sophomore, I went to boarding school for 3 years and had roommates lock me out of the room for tinder hookups, hide drugs in my fridge, and was once roomed with someone who hated my guts, but I can't handle this. As it stands, I'm living in an 8x12 room with someone who hardly leaves. All of our classes are at the same times, so I can't even rely on time to myself while she's in class. She always eats in the room, either microwaving her food in her microwave, or only leaving for roughly 15 minutes to go pick it up and come back. I know the typical response is to just tune her out, but I also have ptsd and am hypervigilant and literally can't do that.

Honestly, if it was just her not leaving, I'd likely be fine, but she's also very controlling of the environment in the room. She always wants the lights off and the heat on. If I even turn on the small light she gets up and turns it off within 5 minutes. It kills my head to be on my computer or phone with the lights off. The heat makes it so I can't sleep because I'm way too warm and literally wake up drenched in sweat. I can't work on my computer after she lays down to sleep because apparently she can't sleep with me typing, which isn't loud in the slightest, but I'm constantly hearing her music through her headphones and she won't turn it down.

I'm incredibly wound up right now because I have no privacy and am not allowed to take up space in my own room. Even if I leave the room (as I did today, I've been out for 6 hours), its not the same as alone time and I still have no personal space.

Right now, I need some advice on just getting through this semester, since I can't get a room change until after winter break.",college

771,1702234638.0,"Heard my roommate tell her friend that I ""literally never leave"" the dorm while she thought I was asleep. I think it's time for a change and I need help.","So, my college life so far has been extremely bland. I've made 0 friends, and spend the majority of my time with at work, working on homework, or alone.

Working 2 jobs, one of them which kinda makes me miserable, kinda results in me being chronically underslept and as an invidual I've always been depressed and a loner. I've had 0 friends since middle school because some extreme trauma I went through made me extremely socially incapable since it resulted in me becoming mute and it's kind of hard to make friends with people when you can't speak to them. Although I've mostly recovered from the mutism, the social aspects of it still haunt me as being alone basically the entirety of my childhood has kind of trained me to prefer that way of living.

Freshman year I briefly attempted to make friends with my dorm hall but the social interactions were so mentally painful and exhausting for me I eventually gave up on it. And when I did eventually make one friend last year they were emotionally and financially abusive to me, and we kinda existed in a codependent relationship until I eventually cut them off during summer. I can understand my struggles freshman year since I'd just gotten out of an abusive household an was trying to cope with the changes. But even back then I feel like i left the dorm more.

This semester, I've just had even less motivation to make friends after cutting off the previously toxic one and knowing that everyone has basically settled into their frirnd groups. Because of that I know I've been in the dorm WAY more. But hearing it from the perspective of my roommates kinda stings. I've never wanted to be that kind of roommate. Kinda hurts more since I'd just got off an opening shift and decided to actually sleep for once, otherwise I wouldn't have been in the dorm right now because I DO leave sometimes. But still, I understand from having a roommate who never leaves how annoying it can be and I don't wanna be that person.

The professor did not give any explicit or written requirements for the project, just a few sentences at the start of the semester. Imagine something like ""Go make a site that behaves like Reddit. It should have users, mods and admins. Users can make posts, comments and edit them. Mods can do what users do + delete posts and comments. Admins can do what mods do + delete users, create users"". That was the level of detail.

We scheduled time with him last week to review it. We asked to schedule in advance because I have a kid and needed to get a babysitter. We were scheduled at 6:00pm. We got there early but at 6:00 when he arrived he sat down with another group. He didn't see us until 7:30. He looked at our site, logged in, tried the first link and was unhappy with what it did. He told us we failed, we clearly didn't meet the business requirements, we're not a good group and should find new partners and that we should start from scratch. He then said he had a class to teach soon soon and that we had to leave, he would not talk with us anymore.

It was insane. We had an entire semester of work into a site and he gave us literally <5 mins and said we failed. I emailed him the next day asking him to please look again, there must have been a misunderstanding (was trying to be polite) and that we had a fully functional site. He responded the next day saying that he did not meet any business requirements, our implementation was entirely incorrect and we need to start over.

&#x200B;

I emailed him again, reiterating the misunderstanding and listing off several business requirements we met (the things he said in the beginning of the semester) and that we just wanted him to review the entirety of our site because he only visited a single page. He agreed. We met with him yesterday and sat down for **2 hours** reviewing our site. He was hostile and he nitpicked every single little thing, none of which were requirements he mentioned.  Things like: our site used military time instead of standard time. That one of the sections of the site only listed the user's email, not their phone number (email was a requirement, phone number was never mentioned) etc etc. At one point he complained we were missing something, I told him he could find it at a different part of the site and he said ""if you want to argue with me i'll just leave"". At the end he said he was going to mark our project as Incomplete, that we should both find new partners, we had a ton of work to do and that all our data was bad.

&#x200B;

I do not believe it was possible to pass this class. I don't know if he had a grudge against me for some reason, if its because my group was entirely women, because im young and have a kid or what. I'm not claiming our site was perfect, we definitely missed some details here and there, but i'm 100% confident it should have been sufficient to pass (its a graded class but hes just marking it as incomplete). I've reached out to other groups in the class and the majority failed and many of them were taking this class for the 2nd or 3rd time. He's been the only professor to teach this class for a few years but after enough complaints they added a 2nd professor this semester apparently.

&#x200B;

I'm not sure what to do. I landed my dream job and i'm supposed to start in 2 weeks. I don't know what's going to happen if they find out I didn't graduate.

I was thinking of calling my advisor and seeing if there was any way we could get the other professor who teaches this course to grade our project but i'm not sure if the school would even listen to what I have to say.

&#x200B;

Any advice on what to do? I'm terrified of whats going to happen with my job in 2 weeks. I'm afraid to email my professor asking for am actual grade or any clarification of what exactly he's looking for,  because i'm afraid it will set him off. I'm just not sure what to do.

My third year I had to move to the tiny satellite campus away from the main one away from my friends so that sucked super hard.  Then just when things started to look better COVID hit.  And everything just went to shit.

So now I'm accustomed to half assing everything.  Why go to class when you could just go to a zoom meeting.  Why pay attention in class when you can just look at the notes later.  Why bother to study for anything since every test is open note open book open internet.  I'm not really learning, I'm struggling to complete meaningless tasks.  When you compare my first year of college, I was in a classroom half the day, studying in the library, sleeping in the dorms, making friends and partying.

In nursing, I broke down crying in front of a few professors, primarily because of anxiety. One of them was really sweet and gave me a chocolate bar, but the other one kinda just stared at me until I was done crying, then continued with what she was saying.

I just got up and began to leave, because I figured why in the world would I sit here and do homework when I could get a head start on my commute home and do my homework… at home? I also had to poop. The professor interrupted me as I was leaving and said “You can’t just leave, you know.” 

I just kind of looked at him like ??? then left anyways because it was awkward and embarrassing. He gave me partial attendance for the day.

It has a full kitchen/dining area, bathroom, living space, and a big closet that can fit all my clothes. AND it’s in walking distance from my school. It’s perfect for the next year or two until I graduate. I plan to be pretty minimal since it’s a tiny space. A couch, bed, tv, maybe a dresser that can be used as a TV stand and storage, and a table that can be used as a desk and eating area. I’m probably going to be visiting home a lot so I don’t get lonely (which I’m a bit scared of). It’s only an hour drive. Anyway, any advice is appreciated. Advice about living alone for the first time, being social in college so I don’t get lonely, living in small areas, etc. etc. etc. Thanks!",college

**FAQ About Friends in College**


**What should I do when I arrive on college to meet people**

Okay so the first week on campus- especially in the dorms- there is a bit of magic in the air. Everyone is nervous and while some people may have friends from highschool or from their childhood- pretty much everyone is looking to make friends. Take advantage of this!!!!

* Be friendly and talk with people on your floor and in your building. Introduce yourself. Say your major, where you're from, what hobbies you have, etc. Its all small-talk but later on when you see them in the hall it will be easier to strike up conversation 

* Take Initiative. Instead of just saying hi to people- invite some people out to dinner. Or be that one person that organizes dinner with the entire floor (its not weird. Its college. Just fucking do it). If large groups scare you- find a few friendly faces on your floor and ask if they're up for dinner- or going to that cool, definitely not lame freshman event on campus. Or ask if someone wants to go watch the opening football game with you. Or ask if they just want to explore campus. It may be awkward asking people you don't know- but it will be worth it as the friendships grow stronger. 

* Keep your door open. Even if you don't take initiative other people probably will. But if you stay locked up in your room all day then no one will know you're there and you will feel left out. Keep the door open and I promise you there's a good chance you'll just get invited places. Even if you keep your door open don't just stay in your room staring at the wall. Go to the common areas- if you see people socializing just go them. Its not awkward. Its college. Just walk up and say ""Hi I'm chevy- where are you guys from"" or literally anything no one cares. You might meet some cool people, you might not. Might make some friends this way, might not. Still worth a shot. I made some of my friends in college the first week by just randomly talking about anime and CS with strangers- anything can happen. 

* Always say yes. If someone asks you to go to some random book event in the campus center SAY YES. When you start saying no and stop saying yes people will stop asking you to go places. You know all those lame sounding events in the dorms? Yeah no one really goes to them because they care about face painting. They go to meet people. Put yourself out there and don't reject opportunities to meet people

**What if I go to a commuter campus, community college, or live off campus?**

Not to worry my friend. Remember there are people in your shoes too and they want to make friends as well. 

The main advice I would give for people in this situation is to try and stay on campus as much as you can. If you are a commuter student- don't just head home after class. Stay on campus! Engage in any club activities and set your study schedule around these activities. Or get a job on campus. Or just study at the library on campus or wherever! Its hard to make friends when you're never at school. 

Also try talking to a lot of people in your classes. Obviously don't disrupt actual class time- but asking people in your classes if they want to study together or even just saying hi can start friendships. Don't be shy! 

**Its after the first week of school and I still have no friends. What can I do?** 

There are many things you can do! Here are some suggestions: 

* Talk to people in classes. Since class is well underway- you can talk to people in class about current assignments, upcoming assignments, upcoming tests, etc. Its not weird- its college. People are nice! If it is farther in the semester you can ask someone if they want to work on an assignment together or study together. I've never been told no when I asked someone- you typically learn better when you work together anyways!!

* Join a club on campus. Its easier to meet people when you share a common interest- and if you join the hiking club because you like hiking then surely you'll meet people there who also like hiking. Now you have a conversation topic of ""hiking"" you can talk to them about. Yay! If you have no interests you can always just join a club related to your major or career goals and socialize with people there (but if you join the club for your major you can't use the famous 'what's your major' question when first meeting someone). You can also join clubs if you have no knowledge of them and are potentially looking at a new hobby. 
In any case- clubs typically advertise to (mainly) freshmen at the start of each semester- so if your school has an area where the clubs set up little information booths like my school did- just go and talk to some members and get a vibe for the club. If the people seem cool- just join and hope for the best! 


* Get a job on campus. I know, it sounds crazy. But a lot of jobs in college are social and I know I personally made a lot of friends through my job. Even the people working in the dishroom at the dining halls in my school typically talk to each other and work shifts with each other frequently- so its a great way to meet coworkers. And there's never a chance you'll run out of things to talk about at your job because worst case scenario just complain about how working sucks and everyone will agree with you! Win-win. 

* If you live in a dorm: Talk to people!!! A lot of freshmen take the same classes. If you see someone in a study lounge (or similar) and they are working on an assignment for your class- there's no harm in asking them if they want to study with you! Or if you recognize someone in your building from one of your classes you can literally just be like ""Oh hey aren't you in Accounting 101?"". Then you can progress the conversation into asking them if they want to work on class stuff together- and if they live in the same building it'd be super easy to do so!


* Partake in random activities! At my school a lot of people would play pool/ping pong in the dorms and a lot of people would just ask to play or jump in and I got to meet some people that way. Or people play Frisbee outside, or random other games. Its not weird to ask someone if you can play- I promise you. Worst they can say is no- best they can say is yes and you end up with new friends (and have a cool game to play with them too!). 


* Go to parties/other social events. You don't have to drink/smoke/do anything you don't like. Parties have lots of people and its a very social setting- so obviously the potential to meet people there is possible. Even if you're awkward or introverted- plenty of people like that go to parties too. There are also just random events happening daily on campus- all of them can be good ways to find people to talk to!

**I am a sophomore/junior/senior/ and have no friends can I still make friends?** 

Of course. People are looking to make friends no matter what year they are. I made new friends every year I attended college- people do not just stick with who they met freshman year. 

**I don't like my friends, what do I do? Am I stuck with them?**
No, Silly. You can always get new friends. If you don't like your current friendgroup- make sure you don't spend all your time with them. Try to branch out by meeting new people in classes, joining a club, getting a new job on campus, etc. Eventually when you make new friends- you can leave your old friends behind. There are other tips earlier in the guide- you can always follow those if you relied a bit too much on the dorm magic to make your freshman friends!

**Do all your close friends come from freshman year?**

No. While its easier for friendships to become stronger if they start freshman year because you have 4 years to develop a strong bond with someone- close friends come from any year. The person I lived with for a few years I met freshman year- but the person I would call my closest friend I met my sophomore year in college. Some of the closest people that I remain in contact with after graduation I only met late Junior year or even senior year of college. You can make close friends any year- you never know who you may end up meeting!

**Am I the only one that feels so lonely?** 

No. 

Like I said- it is the most common topic on our sub. Lots of college students struggle with the adjustment. You are not alone. Stay strong and try to follow the tips I outlined in the rest of this little guide to make some friends. If you put in the effort I would find it very difficult to believe that you can't make a single good friend. 


**Still having trouble making friends?**


**RELAX**. Making friends takes time and effort. You cannot expect to make close friends immediately. Continue being yourself and you will find friends eventually. No one likes someone who is miserable because they feel alone. Remain positive and remember that there are other people in your shoes too. There is nothing wrong with feeling lonely in college, I'm sure most people on this sub have experienced it at one point or another. Keep doing you, take a deep breath, and enjoy college! The 4 years fly by quick. 


**Is there anything I should avoid to increase my potential to make new friends?**


*Yes*: 

* Avoid staying in your room all day. You cannot make friends if you hide from people 

* Avoid not talking to people. You cannot make friends if you are silent. I know I am a very quiet person but if I can force myself to talk to new people you can too. 

* Avoid remaining comfortable. Those 2 friends from highschool that came with you to college? Don't spend all your time with them. Branch out. Meet new people. Step out of your comfort zone. 


* Avoid not showering. If you smell bad people are less likely to talk to you 

* Avoid posting on this sub about not making friends. This won't help you make friends. Get off reddit and talk to real people instead. We can be your friends too but it probably won't replace the loneliness you feel in real life. 





I was by no means a social butterfly in college and felt loneliness plenty of times- especially being the only one at my out of state college from my highschool (ever!!). Stay calm, remain positive, and try to follow the basic advice outlined in this thread. Good luck! ",college

I’ve lived in my apartment for a month now with a new roomate that I don’t know.

There was one time last week though where I was sitting on the couch in the living room and he was in the kitchen (in view of each other). I again tried to start a conversation with him because it was quiet and I thought it was a good opportunity. I forgot what I said but as soon as I said it he stopped cooking, looked over at me and stared for at least a minute, then went right back to cooking. Completely ignored me. I finally decided it’s not worth my time to try to even be friends with him since he’s a senior in college and he’s moving out at the end of the year. Our other 2 roomates don’t move in until August.

I mean, the professor's job is to answer questions students have rather than tell them to google it so I found it unprofessional. I was interested in the material so I wanted to volunteer for his lab at first, but now I don't think so. Usually, he's really friendly in emails and in person, I don't understand why he answered so harshly. Did I say anything wrong? How worried should I be? Am I overthinking this?

800,1644234128.0,A professor just called me manipulative and disrespectful,"I'm not from the USA, but in my university most exams and midterms are coordinated by the head professor of each subject, so they are the ones that decide the dates, the content, the exam format, etc. Well this semester I noticed that I had two different midterms on the same day, one from 9:00 to 11:00 am and the other one 11:00-13:00 am, so while they didn't overlap since they are being held in different buildings being on time to the second one would be impossible without finishing very early the first one. So I decided to write a formal email to both head professors, to see if anything could be done to ensure that we're able to take both exams on time, since both subjects are for second years normally the are more lenient and understanding with this stuff. The first head professor responded very quickly and told me that he couldn't do anything, the second head proffesor informed me that in this particular case she isn't the one in charge but the proffesor of our respective class is. So naturally I decided to talk to them instead, I write the same email and after a week without a response I decide talking to her directly. Here is where things escalated very quickly...

Basically she was deeply offended by the suggestion, acted like I was saying her subject was less important than the other therefore she must be the one to take on the extra work of changing It, I tried explaining that It certainly wasn't the case the other one just had said no already, and that I just wanted to see if she was open to the possibility to discuss It with the class. She then got somehow more offended and acted like I was trying to undermine her by asking first the headprofessor (again, they are the ones to deal with this stuff in most cases, how could I have known that in this case an exception was made for the midterms??), and called me manipulative for trying to talk her into changing things around (again, I just asked! No harm in asking...) especially without my peers present (I wanted the opportunity to discuss this matter in class with her permission!!). I felt incredibly humiliated and apologised many, many times for 'disrespecting her', but she was having none of It, I even ended up crying a little because I don't handle well people yelling at me and I already had a lot going on (kinda like the last drop to overflow the glass) but she just said that 'I won't be led on by any manipulative behaviour or mannerisms of yours, in any case you should be crying for the utter lack of respect you have towards me'

801,1592311404.0,"If you could give a freshmen a tip about dorming, what would it be?","For me, I’d say: 

Every roommate has a small, petty habit that gets on your nerves. And yes, you probably have one that gets on their nerves, too, they just don’t tell you. It could be something like they put their calls on speaker or never leave the dorm except for class. In my experience, I had a roommate who would always lock the door into our bedroom because she was scared we’d get robbed. Our room was a suite with three rooms: the kitchen/living room and two bedrooms, and the front door. This got kind of annoying at times because I’d always have to get my keys from off the counter after putting them down. And one morning, I was half asleep and needed to use the bathroom so I got locked out of my bedroom because I didn’t realize she locked the door. This is coming from somebody with anxiety disorder who worries about safety to an ungodly degree, it was annoying, and our school is in a bad area, so you better believe it’s well guarded. Because of this, there’d be times when she’d lock herself out and make me stop what I was doing on campus to go open the door, as you only got three free tries from security before they fined you.

Final grades posted, no curve. I had a 90 so I was okay but I know it really screwed some people over. One friend emailed them and they replied that it was to ""teach a lesson"" to only trust what was in the syllabus and they never intended to curve at all.

WHY ARE YOU ASKING A BUNCH OF REDDITORS! Redditors are notorious egomaniacs and dimwits! Me included! Just because you're in r/college doesn't actually mean the people here should dictate scary, large life decisions.

In other words, if you did not register for the draft, this will have no bearing on whether or not you can receive federal student aid.

This is HUGE news, and something we’ve been waiting on for a long time. We had an idea that this was coming, but thought it would be several more years. As someone who’s worked in this field for years, I’ve had to deny many, many students federal aid because of this. Transgender students, students who were incarcerated, and students who were not citizens between the ages of 18-26. Students who *needed* the money.

Outside of FSA, this is huge progress and shows where society, and, more specifically, the Department of Education, currently stands on the SS. It means that, aside from potentially diminished chances at landing a government job, consequences of not registering are nearly nonexistent.

I'm currently a third year undergrad at a uni and I happen to be one of the few older undergrads. Most of my classmates are an average age of maybe 22. I'm taking a Women's studies course that I'm pretty sure fulfills a GE requirement of some kind. We have online discussions even though the class in in person and the professor put us into groups online because the class is rather large. So many of the replies to these discussions are so empty and lacking any thought. It is like they lack any critical thinking or like they simply want to reply to the discussions and get the points. The guidelines say that our replies are supposed to be ""substantive add to the discussion (i.e. reflecting on their response, asking questions, etc.)"" but none of my classmates in the group do that. And on top of that the grammar is horrible and at least one of these with shit grammar is a *senior.* All my classmates do is agree to whatever the other person posted and then say something like ""it was really interesting"" or ""what you wrote made a lot of sense"". Two others along with myself try to follow the guidelines as best as we can. I struggle because there is nothing of substance to reply to.

>What caught my attention about you response is that you explained both questions. Not only that but I also say that you quoted your source. I feel that quoting your source gives more credibility to your response.

The above is a reply from one classmate to another. I can't help but laugh because our professor said that since we were all reading the same book we didn't need to site the source. We could paraphrase and use quotes from the book without worrying that we would be docked points for plagiarizing. I also can't help but laugh because that person's reply is so empty. Perhaps it is because the professor is very lenient with grading, maybe that's the issue here. I read these replies and I'm shocked these are university students. This was shit that I was writing as a freshmen in high school, back when I didn't care about my grades. But this is university for crying out loud, I thought the level of discussions and writing would be at third year uni level.

Anyway, is this just an issue in the U.S that is a reflection of our shit education system? Or am I seeing some sort of generational issue here? Thoughts?

**edit**: a few things i should clarify 1) the discussions online and in person are not random, they are tied into our weekly readings 2) this course is a 300 level course meaning we are a mix of 3rd and 4th year students and 3) we also have in class discussions tied to the readings and the same 5 ppl participate in the in person discussions. pretty sure that 20-50% of our 35 students in class don't do the weekly readings

850,1697143576.0,Professor won't let me leave class 5 minutes early,"I'm taking a class which goes from 3:30-5:30 PM. This issue is that the bus that I need to go on arrives at around 5:30-5:35. Before, the bus used to be right outside of the building I had class in, but the university just reopened the bus terminal which was closed due to construction. The terminal is around a 6 minute walk, which varies because of traffic signals and doesn't include getting down to the ground floor, so I may need to run to make it. I need to make this exact bus because I have a class to attend at 7:00, and I get home at 6:50. If I miss this bus I have to wait 30 minutes for the next one.

I have asked my professor if I could leave a 2 hour class, 5 minutes early each Thursday (1 out of 2 class days). I have tried repeatedly asking and stating points, but he just keeps saying that missing 5 minutes of a class every 2 class periods is a ""insurmountable"" and ""exceptional"" request. What can I do? Is it even the professor's place to tell me when I can and can't leave his class?

Edit:I've read a bunch of the comments, which are pretty mixed tbh, but I'm going to see if my family and my personal trainer can reschedule to a different day, where the professor of that class doesn't care when I leave. The bus also comes consistently late, so I will run to catch it when possible. Thanks for all the responses. I will take the L here.

I also didn't ask many times, just one time technically, but I replied when he said no, seeing if he could compromise in any way.

Also wanted to add that any professor in here, who thinks that students need to be in class the whole time, for classes they pay for, is crazy. If I do the assignments and the work and am at class early, I don't see how you justify not letting me leave early, or having that effect my grade. Your job is to teach and see that students know the material, not always check on them to make sure they are there to learn.",college

This semester was almost my last semester (only need one class in summer to graduate now), and with my school offering the option of S/U grade because of COVID-19, I realized it’s time to finally take this class.

It turned out to be one of the most enjoyable classes I’ve ever taken. The prof was also great. I genuinely enjoyed the subject, and put in so much effort that I earned an A in the class that I was always afraid of.

862,1633814604.0,"My Advice: If you ever feel slow and dumb or are struggling in a class, focus on overcoming the difficulty instead of your intelligence and trust in that process","I mean my dad told me a story about when he was a student. He was in a spatial geometry class and he was the slowest one in the class. Everybody else seems to be much quicker then him. However, he never gave up and tried his best. He eventually overcame all difficulties and become even better at the subject then everybody else. 

I have a mental illness that causes me to constantly assess my intelligence and care too much about it, even if their's no evidence that I was struggling in any classes. I always think to the future about some difficult classes coming up and I'm worried I'm going to be the slowest and stupidest one in the class. I always have the tendency to put myself in the shoes of another (such as a mathematician) or to think myself in a certain situation (such as being in a programming class) and then always ending up forming the conclusion that I might be below average or stupid (even if I wasn't struggling in any classes this semester at all). I always think back to the one programming class in which I have to take as a accounting major that I struggled with more than others. I always go to my dad for advice when such thoughts pop up. 

My dad's advice is usually this, and I feel it helped alot. He taught me to focus on the effort, not your innate talent or intelligence. He said for me to be positive and ignore such thoughts and focus on what you're supposed to be doing. I feel that this helped alot. I mean programming is kinda my own fault as I didn't work hard enough to overcome it and focused more on intelligence instead. 

My dad taught me a story of how he's the slowest one at work (I'm not sure if he's making this up or not), he's a engineer. He said everybody is faster then he is at figuring stuff out, however he still didn't feel discouraged or give up (despite not being the sharpest knife in the drawer). Instead he used whatever cards that he's dealt to work hard to figure things out (even if it takes him longer) and asks other's for help when needed. Eventually he ends up performing equally as well or even better then the people that are supposedly smarter and quicker.

The point of me telling everybody this is that if you ever feel that you're slow and dumb and aren't the sharpest knife in the drawer, you shouldn't focus to much on the fact that you aren't naturally smart or as quick witted as some other people. Instead you should focus on trying to overcome the difficulty and believe in the fact that if you try hard enough and never give up, everything's eventually going to click. If you struggle with applying what you learned or with logical thinking, do more practice and eventually things would get easier. 

Remember their are people with good genes that don't make the best of their abilities simply because they're lazy and that hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard. 

If you're naturally smart, then great. But if you aren't, just trust in the process and not give up.",college

Since meeting my roommate  at the beginning last college semester (August), he’s never seemed to have a problem with me being shirtless in the mornings before class, or when I’m in the dorm for the night (the only time I’m really in the dorm). Being shirtless has always been more comfortable for me, and in my own personal home, I typically walk around shirtless. 

Last night, he expressed his feelings and said he doesn’t like me being shirtless in the room because it makes him feel insecure. I’ve always invited him to workout and run with me and this isn’t the first time I’ve heard him complain about his weight.

Of course I have never harassed, bullied, or even cared how much he weighs or about his physical appearance. For me however, the dorm room is the one space where I feel like I can truly decompress and relax.

You were looking forward to this time, so you better take advantage of it. I know, you are only home for a limited time and you want to see all your friends. That's cool. But take some small time to actually take care of yourself.

\- If you are spending it at home, then please spend some time hanging out with your parents and family. If you got them nearby, go see your grandparents. Looking back, I wish I would have just spent a bit more time with my mom when I was home.

\- Check your grades. Celebrate, cry, ponder, but take a moment to really look at where you are and see if you are doing as you expect. Not liking your classes? Still want to major in that? Is this your 3rd time taking a course? Sit down and really evaluate where you are, and if you are taking the right steps to get to where you think you want to go.

\- Check on your funds. Those of you that are lucky to have your parents pay for your education, please do not take it for granted. If you know you are going to be short for the next semester, look at job options, loans, and any possible scholarships. Mapping out how much you are going to owe before you start can put you in a better position.

\- If you are considering not going back to school, like you are for sure not going back, TELL SOMEONE. You do not need a big fat bill showing up on your doorstep because you failed to withdraw the correct way. Tell admissions, tell a family member, and talk to someone. Do not assume that this will be taken care of.

\- If you are feeling down over break, find someone to talk to. Yes, it is okay to text a friend and say ""Hey, if you got a minute to talk or hang, I would really appreciate it. I am not doing well right now."" Reach out to people. Talk it out. Do not bottle things up. Help is out there.

\- If your graduation is in the upcoming year, or you know you are going to be doing a lot of interviews soon, make sure you got a professional sounding email and an updated resume.

872,1654789937.0,A Lot of Students Have Really Declined,"I hope I don't sound like those ""holier than thou"" profs, but I need to say this: COVID has really made some students get lazy and more entitled. I am an undergraduate myself, and I have been TAing for four semesters now. Most of my students are great or they don't cause any problems. But this semester I definitely had a few bad apples. For context, I TA general physics classes meant for biology and chemistry majors. I try to understand that taking a physics class after lots of biology can be challenging for them and they do not know as much math, and I try to be cognizant of their situation, but some of the behaviors and excuses I have seen are just completely ridiculous.

One student did not know how to use the chain rule when a semester of calculus 1 is a prerequisite and then complained how unfair it was they have to know how to take derivatives. I explained that yes they need to know how to do derivatives as that's a prereq for this course and it is their responsibility to review those derivative rules if they feel like they need to brush up.

Another student got a question completely wrong, so I explained the correct answer and why they were wrong and they said ""Yeah obviously we know that; we're not stupid."" They then proceeded to call me rude and condescending for correcting their mistake. I even asked how they felt I could be more conscious while correcting them and the student couldn't tell me anything.

A student gave me a very low score in TA evaluations because they felt it was unfair that they have to solve the workshop problems themselves and that I should be doing them on the board for everyone (yes someone actually said this). I decided to write more setups and important concepts and equations on the board to help, but some students called me lazy and distant for only doing this because ""he doesn't want to do the work.""

This is the one that takes the cake though. I had to grade their participation in workshop. The professor told the TAs to have 5 out of 10 points for just attending and the other 5 points for how much they participated. This one group of students did not participate that much, so I did not give them 10/10 on their workshop grade. They emailed me saying how they feel that my grade for them was so unfair. I did not have much faith in how much work they did, so I wanted to see if they could back it up, so I told them I would raise their grades if they could show me written work for the workshops and gave them a deadline. Most of the group followed through, and i raised their grades accordingly. Then they responded saying how they feel that it is so ""hurtful"" that I didn't raise their grades even more. One student did not make the deadline and emailed me a day after, and I just said ""No I'm sorry. You were late, so I will not be raising your grade,"" and then I got a nasty email after that as well.

While most students I work with are great, I keep seeing an increase in this ridiculous entitled behavior, and this is ridiculous. Is anyone else seeing this, or does this seem to only be a problem at my college?

Edit: For the comments describing how COVID has been very rough for them, I can sympathize. COVID has definitely affected many students negatively and caused them struggle. Most profs and TAs are aware of this. That said, I think it is best to email profs and TAs and explain your situation and explain the ways you need support, not make entitled demands and not put in any kind of effort. Many students have constructively talked to me about this, and we were able to find a solution.

I am not just paying to learn, but I am paying for the material as well and so I like to download everything that is offered to us through canvas in case I ever want to look back at what I learned or want to look something up. But also, I pay to be exposed to new material and view it as my property too.

885,1587320200.0,Best four years of my life?,"I hate admitting that I don’t think college really was the best four years of my life. It was slightly better than high school but not enough tbh. I would the best thing about my college experience was that I was able to rush a sorority my junior year yet I wish I would’ve at least started a year before. However, I couldn’t do that because I was a transfer student. I feel kinda bitter that my experience didn’t live up to my expectations and I’m terrified of what my life is gonna look like after this chapter of my life. I was supposed to be graduating this semester but my graduation got cancelled because of the virus. I’m trying to see the positives in the hardships I’ve experienced but I’ve really struggled. I’ve dealt with fake friends and I cut them off even though it was really hard and I didn’t meet decent people until I joined my sorority. I had a boyfriend for a year who was never really worth it and in retrospect I regret ever meeting him. And now that I’m graduating I feel like “my time is running out” and I feel myself getting older even though I’m 22. I always tell myself that I have higher expectations for the rest of my life because high school and college weren’t that amazing but I don’t wanna be disappointed again.

My college also generally doesn't have a fun, social atmosphere anyway. The fact I haven't had any fun experiences also makes me feel bad about myself as a person too.

My time in college has been mostly doing HW and trying to improve myself. I'm not having any fun and it bums me out because college is usually the last time you get to be young, reckless, and just wildly enjoy life. I'm sad I probably won't get to have that.

A sizable amount of people would be disqualified for medical reasons or the fitness test (by no fault of their own, it’s difficult). Most people don’t want to join the military. It’s a difficult, often lifelong commitment that often can lead to serious injury and trauma.

892,1698142570.0,Sunk 5 hours into two essays for them to count towards my grade.,"Edit: sunk five hours into two different essays just for them to not count towards any grade (even final grade)


Does anyone consistently do work for it not even count towards anything numerical in the class?

Yesterday I had two exams, one which I studied for about 25 hours, the other three hours. Then I had work- just a six hour shift. Then I get back home to spend five hours on writing essays that aren't even being graded. I think I went to bed at 1 just to go to clinical at 5. I'm running on four hours of sleep, I'm so cold and so exhausted. This is every week, doing the shit for this stupid art class which has more work involved than my pharmacology course. 

I'm a nursing student, I am past the point of caring about getting good grades, I just want to pass my non-core classes.

Should I talk to the prof? I'm not at work enough, I'm getting in trouble for not making the hours, I don't have enough time to study, I don't have enough time do spend on things that don't count for a grade. 

I'm a junior, my last 3.2 semesters. What do I even do?

Edit: okay, since some of you have issues with my post I'm going to make this crystal clear. 

Yes I am doing two degrees at once, yes this is possible. Look it up, lots of bachelor programs are partnering with different schools connected to magnet hospitals. I will graduate with my associates next may, and my bachelors the next may after that. Hence why I'm focused on my nursing courses and not my gen Ed's. Thank you so much to the person that pointing out my grammatical mistakes. I'm so sorry that I made this post when I was upset and on four hours of sleep and also on the OB surgical floor (high acuity if you're not in the medical field). So I was quite busy at the time and no my professional writing does not look like that. I am taking 19 credits, this art class is one credit, my clinical are 8 credits, my lab is 1 credit, my pharm course is three credits, my OB/PEDS/ MED SURGE course is three credits and I'm also taking a philosophy course for three credits. Im trying to finish my bachelors as fast as possibly, I never take a break, I take one class every winter break and three classes over summer. I've always done this and yes it sucks but school sucks and I want to get it over with. 

This class is not an art history course, it's called art anatomy where we have to pick events that we do essays and class presentations on, so every week two essays and two presentations plus traveling to an art Museum/ show to gather data. All in all this class takes me about 8 hours per week just to do the bare minimum. Which seems excessive since that's not accounting for the three hours of class time that it takes up during the week.

For those of you who encouraged me to talk to my prof, I did end up going to her in person after class. They do count for a grade, she was just using the wrong syllabus attached to the course (how do you not notice that you have uploaded the wrong document for a particular class is beyond me). So, yes I got it worked out with her, and now I don't feel as terrible about me ""wasting time"". 

And everyone that is saying ""if MLA is so easy why did it take you five hours"", this paper was five pages long, single spaced and a small font (in respect to the profs paper policy). Complete with citations, headers and formatting it takes a while to make. For all of you that say MLA is easy, in comparison it is, to APA. I've never been trained to do APA, even in high school and middle school everything was MLA all day. I've been writing in this format since- fifth grade. That was 8 years ago so by god, I would HOPE that I know how to do it by now. 

For all of those who came in with a supportive response, you're awesome, keep being you. For everyone that gave snarky responses, just why? Why can't you put yourself in another persons shoes. Grow up. ",college

894,1595599690.0,Anyone else have a ‘famous’ professor?,"I was looking up my professors on RateMyProfessor to get an idea of what they’re like in class (not the most accurate predictor but eh, it’s what we have), and I found out that my math professor has a Wikipedia article on him. 

Turns out, he’s an editor of a mathematics journal and has a ton of published textbooks! Like, actual physical textbooks that you can get on Amazon and teach with. That’s the first time I’ve ever seen a professor have that. 

Anyone else ever take a course with someone “famous”/well-known in their field?",college
895,1649608192.0,Update: I am a college professor taking a freshman level college course this semester…here is what I have learned so far,"College is hard.  Really really hard.  I have an entirely new appreciation for how difficult learning new material is after this experience.  With a few weeks left to go…here is what I have learned so far.

- if you are lucky enough to be going to school and just focusing on school, please take advantage of it and study/learn all you can.  I don’t have kids, but I have a full time job, freelance gigs, a boyfriend, two cats and a dog.  All these things need my attention.  I get interrupted so much while I’m sitting at the kitchen table trying to study.  I was taking a timed exam Tuesday and my dog did his “I need to poop dance” and I could not leave the computer.  He pooped on the floor and ate it.  So if you are lucky enough to not have kids or a full time job, please take advantage of this time because you will never be able to focus like this again in your life.
- I think social media has killed our attention spans.  I do not remember having this much trouble focusing when I was in college 15 years ago.  I have to read and reread and reread again to understand.  I was also diagnosed with ADHD in my 30s so not sure if that’s part of it, but lord do I have trouble focusing and processing.  Makes me wonder how many students struggle with just reading and taking notes and taking a test.  It’s a really difficult way to learn.
- prioritize where to put your energy.  I wrote my first post because I got a 79 on the first test.  It is important to me to get A’s.  So I analyzed the grading break down and realized in the grand scheme, the tests don’t count for that much.  I stopped stressing so much over studying for the tests and made sure to hit every single other assignment and even though my tests continue to be in the 80-90 range, I have an A average in the class.

As much as I can’t wait to be done with the semester, I’m glad for this experience.  I learned a lot as a professor about things that work and don’t work.  There are some weeks where there is just too much work and I can’t get it all done.  So I do my best.  I teach a class very similar to the one I am taking and I will be revising how I teach it significantly after this experience.  Good luck on the rest of the semester to everyone who is reading this, we can do it and a break is almost here!!",college
896,1615809473.0,"When I am discouraged about college, old replies from professors help lift my spirits","At the end of every semester, after final grades come out and things settle a bit, I send a short email to my professors thanking them for their patience and time in teaching me. I briefly mention my favorite parts of the class, little things they did that meant a lot, and how I'll incorporate their lessons in the future. 

(I do this after final grades are released so they don't get the impression that I'm trying to kiss up to boost my grade. Also because I feel like teachers are also stressed at this time, trying to get all the students processed and grade all their exams.)

Even if their class wasn't my favorite or if I did poorly, it reminds me to count my blessings. 

Most of the time they appreciate me reaching out, extend words of encouragement, and wish me well on my journey. 

I pin these replies and save them in a folder for a rainy day. 

Last semester I experienced a rough patch that affected my academic performance. I used to be enthusiastic about school and learning in general, but for some reason even the smallest amount of reading (which is my primary and most reliable study method) required a great deal of energy to complete. My test anxiety was at its worst. I felt like my old self that desired knowledge and enjoyed college was gone. A few days ago, I was scrolling through old emails and I found a few from my former professors. Although a small gesture, their words of encouragement really helped me get out of that funk and helped renew that familiar curiosity that motivated me to pursue my degree. They believed in me, even though I didn't believe in myself. 

I just wanted to share this with all of you. You don't have to do what I did though. I hope this can help someone. Thanks for reading this far. College can be overwhelming, anxiety ridden, and stressful as it is, let alone during a pandemic which has changed so many aspects of life. Even though I'm just a random person on reddit, I believe in each of you, and I wish you the best in your academic and personal endeavors. :) Stay safe.",college

It’s only been 2 rooms who are close to each other that have seemed to pit each other all against me. I am so sick and tired of this, and while this whole situation with them has been going on, it’s not even a majority of why I’m leaving. I can’t believe how inconsiderate, grossly negligent, and irresponsible people these residents all are, and if I hear any loud noise from them I am having no warnings anymore and immediately writing them up. I hate them, I hope they hate me back because I never want to interact with them after this school year.

Edit: So this got a lot more traction that I assumed it would. Due to some confusion, here is my copy and pasted comment for further context. 

For people asking for missing context - I apologize, I got really heated last night and then passed out. I used to my friends with these residents before I became an RA for the same building I lived in last semester. At the start of this semester they pulled a fake, unmarked gun on me and pointed it at other residents of mine. After getting a heavy write up for that, they became borderline violent with their retaliation and began to scream at me nightly or when they saw me. The girlfriend of the boy who pulled the fake gun on me called me a “fucking bitch” when I was walking to a meeting and attempted to chase me down the hall. Her friends held her back. I have been more than lenient with them since this incident, because I have been worried about genuinely being shot in my dorm. I can afford not being an RA, even though it will take a huge toll on my finances. I honestly loved my job before this whole mess. It isn’t even the reason I’m leaving as well, my bosses transferred me to another area that would be a serious downgrade from my current situation and wouldn’t listen when I asked for negotiation on the area.

The same residents that I have problems with have also been arrested, drink heavily almost every night (to the point of alcohol poisoning), are incredibly racist and homophobic, and on top of that have been nearly kicked out of housing on multiple accounts.

I will fully admit that I can be hot headed towards them, but I have been dealing with them for far too long. I genuinely love my job, and I am heartbroken that I’ll be leaving some of my favorite co workers and miss out on a great training with them. I was planning on returning before I found out I would be transferring areas, but I know I wouldn’t be happy if I had transferred there.

Best of luck on finals all, I hope this provides some well needed context from my very pissed off post last night.",college

The day I get sick with some sort of stomach bug (pretty much just severe nausea) I drive to class early, on my way I think, hey, it's a test, maybe if I ask my professor if I could take it in the hallway outside of class he'd let me. 
I get there and I go to walk to his office. At this point I'm physically struggling, like clutching the walls, deep breathing. I'm standing outside his office and I'm just like ""if I start to talk I think I'm actually going to throw up"" so I walk back out to my car and sit in it for a solid fifteen to twenty minutes. 
I feel pretty much no better, and I'm like, ok I physically can't do this. I don't care if I get a zero at this point so I just drive home, I later message him telling him what happened and sure enough there's nothing I can do.

I'm not really mad about it, but I just find it crazy that if a student gets an illness that they physically have no control over whatsoever and try their best to get to class and Is just unwell enough to do so they just immediately fail? Like what if I had COVID? You're telling me I pretty much got an F for following the colleges rules on illnesses? Just weird.

Edit: 
Since a lot of people are responding and offering really helpful advice I have some things I should probably add that I forgot to. 

I emailed him in the parking lot before leaving explaining the situation, and got the ""no make ups, final exam replaces lowest score"" response. The final exam policy is something I forgot to mention as it's been stapled in every college class I've taken since I started going there, so I had forgotten to mention it in my post. 
I don't think I'm going to drop the class as it's General Psych and I'm pretty confident in my ability to still pass, but I do still have a lot of time until the drop date in case i change my mind.

I majored in accounting, from my Accounting I class to the upper level bachelors classes, I cheated. I regret that so much. I have such little accounting knowledge. At work, my boss started asking me elementary accounting questions and I couldn't answer him. I was so embarrassed and I knew then that he regretted hiring me.

916,1699046665.0,College feels like an absolute waste of time.,"It all started in high school and not knowing what to do with life, though I knew I wasn’t going to do engineering. And I knew that I loved anatomy and whatnot. So I enlisted in the army for 6 years as a medic and did that with the benefit of **almost** free college. I also worked in a hospital drawing blood and stuff and have a very good side hustle working with antiques (essentially museum conservation). I have now been working on a biology degree with the original intent on going to med school. But I don’t want to go to med school anymore because I’d like to enjoy my 20s-30s, have a life (I worked in a hospital I know what they go through) and not have 400k+ in debt. Now I’ll get into why I feel like college is a waste, I have taken soo many classes, and it’s just like highschool. You take a class that has nothing to do with what you’ll do in a career and throw everything away that you learned once the semester is over. You do the real learning on the job, I worked with nurses that didn’t remember anything important from college, I have had to teach them things in the hospital (I don’t have a degree I’m just a nobody). I swear I have met so many people with degrees that don’t know much of anything. Also what really angers me is how there is no standard in colleges, each professor essentially writes their own rules. My chemistry professor made a pass/fail system 80% or more on each quiz to get a point. Any lower than 80% and you’d get a 0%. Take the same class with a different professor, and the whole grading system is different. Go to the same class at a different college and it is taught completely differently. No standard at all. I have learned so much outside of college and have made wayyy more connections outside of college, I have grown wayyy more without college. I believe I can be successful without having a degree, seems like a waste of time.

I’m just going to add that nobody in my family has a degree but some of my family members currently work on college boards. Funny huh no degree and making decisions for the college. Colleges are just a business trying to take as much money as they can.

**Tip #1 Use Rate My Professor and Pick Easy Professors/Classes for Your Gen-Eds**

- this is my best advice! No need to go out of your way for a challenging class or professor especially if it’s your first year. You’re still getting used to college and no one will judge you for taking the easiest option available, especially for your gen-Ed classes where you might not ever use the information you learn again. I tend to look for professors rated 4.5-5 stars for each of my classes and take note of them so I can register when the time comes. Taking easy classes during your early semester will help later on when you have actual difficult classes. 


- Edit: Tip #1 Cont. Read reviews and find professors that teach how you learn. If you suck at essays, try not to take a professor with a bunch of essays. Same with quizzes etc. Some things you can’t avoid but different professors have different teaching styles for the same content. Find what works best for you!

**Tip #2 Check Your Syllabus Weekly**

- I check my syllabus at least once a week to make sure I know what to expect for the upcoming week and make sure I didn’t miss anything. Also, I promise you all of the info you need is on your syllabus or something similar. Deadlines? Check the syllabus. Quiz? Check the syllabus. Group project? Check the syllabus! It’ll save you so much stress if you check your syllabus for the upcoming week and take note of upcoming assignments. 


**Tip #3 Go to Office Hours / Tutoring (when you need it)**

- I’m not saying that you have to go to every single office hour session but if you’re struggling with a specific topic, I strongly recommend showing up. Even if you’re afraid to ask in class, you can quickly get help during office hours and feel confident that you know what to do. My professors were so kind and helpful during office hours and were glad I came for help even if it was so simple. 


**Tip #4 Break Down Your Assignments Into  Specific Tasks and Write It All Down**

- I thrive on checking things off so I use a notebook (use whatever is most practical for you) and I write down every single thing I have to do to complete an assignment for the current week. Assignments can look daunting so breaking it down can help you to quickly get things done and make progress even if you don’t do it all in one go. So even if it’s just researching info before writing an essay, I like to be aware of all the necessary work needed to complete a task so I can prepare accordingly. The worst thing ever is leaving an assignment for last minute and realising it’s a lot more than you bargained for. 


**Tip #5 Don’t Wait For The Right Time To Do Work**

- If you’re free now, WORK now. I don’t believe in a set schedule because things come up or change constantly. Have five minutes before you go out? Plan that essay. That’ll be five minutes less later. Class got canceled, (nap, then) catch up on stuff with the extra time. Don’t wait till it’s the perfect time or place to get work done or you’ll never get it done. Think about the time you’ll save later if you use that time now.

I, like all of my classmates, take notes while she’s lecturing. I don’t even look at the PowerPoint because the info there is so useless; I just type summaries of what she’s saying and then anything interesting or of note.

My professor has recently been refusing to let us see the PowerPoint during her lectures because “everyone’s just typing”.

I made the mistake of asking if there was any extra credit I could do to raise my grade 0.12% in my freshman year class and the professor released her pent-up frustration from finals onto me via email. Very crappy experience. This is not a scenario of ""the worst they can say is no"", the worst they can say is ""this is horrifically inappropriate"" and make it very uncomfortable for you every time you take that professor again.

EDIT: Oh wow. Lots of arguments in the replies. I gotta be honest here, I actually... don't agree with the professors/students saying this is juvenile behavior. I really don't think a 89.9% and a 90% are worth two different grades. It's the same amount of work. I think a grade that is so close to being upped to another letter grade should at least be able to be requested to be upped when it's in the 0.1-0.4 percents. I get this can be tough for a professor to do something like this, and some students will take a mile when you give an inch, so it's only sensible that professors stray away from bumping up their students a grade. But I don't think asking is juvenile behavior, these little letter grades make a world of difference for us. Basically what I'm saying is I both understand completely why a professor would refuse to do this, and why a student would ask. I think overall it's something that should be completely avoided to avoid frustration and awkwardness for both ends. I hope this makes sense. This is just my opinion.

And to the people in the replies saying ""I asked and my professor bumped me up 5%!"" That's awesome! But that's also pretty rare. I've heard significantly more horror stories about asking than good ones. If you still wanna ask though, that's up to you, but don't expect a letter of recommendation, y'know?",college

Maybe I can't relate because I had a weird high school experience myself but I imagine most of you have had the same friend group since elementary school and don't know any different. 

It's not a big deal to be alone sometimes. People come and go, have different schedules, or just nothing in common. Put yourself out there and do everything you can but just starting out at college you'll honestly tie yourself down if you expect to have a ""group"" right off the bat. Your interests and whats important to you will change, for now it's perfectly normal to talk to as many people as possible and as you explore college as well as yourself some things will stick and others won't, that's just life. Don't interact with people with an expectation they'll be your best friend, relax, and enjoy getting to know others from different backgrounds.

Trust me, literally NO ONE cares if you're doing things alone sometimes. Get comfortable with yourself, because that's probably the first step to getting comfortable with others.

she told me she keeps the window open and the fan on but idk how big of a bowl shes hitting because the *entire* dorm building smells like weed every time shes smoking. it lingers for hours, and the smell is so strong it would fill my room. everyone in the building knows its her and we can all tell when shes smoking.

if we're being honest, shitty weed does not smell that great in the first place. and she probably smokes 1 time in the morning, 1 time in the middle of the day, and probably twice at night. maybe that doesn't sound like alot but it smells sooo loud for hours every time, shes using joints *and* a bong too. 

its alot, all day it smells. how can i nicely ask her to try and smoke by the window, or maybe hit smaller bowls..?. idk how i can even resolve this because shes probably blind to how much it smells in the halls and in other peoples rooms. 

idk what to do honestly, it just stinks and i know im not the only one whos tired of it. me and a few other people in the building also smoke but majority of us actually go outside or use a pen, but we can always tell when shes smoking because it just really stinks up the entire building. we made jokes abt it hoping she'd get a hint but she didnt. how can i be blunt to her about the smell shes making. (lol blunt)

edit: i just want to point out that i really do not want to tell the RA. also because i think most of everyone smokes something, we just all have pens because its an apartment building. idk what she smokes for (if pain or anxiety or something) and shes a very nice person. just what advice can i give her to help lower the smell. and also keep it away from my room",college

This discussion post assignment was pass/fail, so you can either get a 0 or 100.

I put a lot of work into writing my discussion post well, and it was all just a waste of time and effort because of two words. I sent her an email explaining my situation and how I didn't realize she wanted EXACTLY 200 words (nowhere in the requirements did she clearly say we needed EXACTLY 200 words).

960,1708909568.0,Being lost in college isn’t always a bad thing.,"I mean one can get a trade, get a CDL, or  drive UPS. So even if things didn’t work out in college one had many options and alternatives. You can be struggling, lazy, lost, unmotivated or simply having all the fun in he world during all four years of college but as long as you obtain a trade or some short certificate program that directly leads to a career after getting your degree you are all good. In fact, with the degree that you got you can move into management within 5 or so years of doing the trade. And even then the degree can help you perform better at your trade. 

But regardless of what you do be sure to get as much work experience as you can. This’ll not only help your resume but also build those all important skills. You can also work at a warehouse during college and after some time be promoted with a degree. Companies like Amazon have programs for college graduates.

I am due to start in September and hope to live on residence. This is not especially unusual where I’m from in Ontario. I believe I made the pragmatic decision, though, admittedly, I do still feel a bit insecure about it.  I’m a little worried about what it’ll be like bunking up with a bunch of 18 year olds fresh out of high school, and whether a maturity difference will make things like meeting friends, dating, and finding roommates to live with for the duration of my degree significantly more awkward. Other people who’d attempted to dissuade me from taking another year before university said as much, and after this last semester, I don’t really want to feel like Billy Madison again.

989,1708889859.0,Room Lockouts and Security's Failing System,"I've had a lot of issues recently with my college and thought it was important to share.

For context, I'm a sophomore at a private school in Virginia. After two years here, I have had many issues with ResLife and it's continuing to worsen. I currently have a service animal and this is his second semester here with me. ResLife has also told me I'm required to keep him on a leash, whenever his tasks interfere with it. But that is a whole other issue.

Last fall semester, I was cleared to move in (via email) early because of my dog. I went to pickup my keycard, and was told I couldn't move in early because the worker had not received an email from the director giving me permission to move in. She refused to help me for a while, and after an hour finally agreed to make some phone calls. It took two hours for me to get into my room.

This semester, I was also cleared to move in early due to my dog. I drove halfway across the country, finally arrived at my school (after 5pm on a saturday), and keyed into my room. I put my animal in my room, and went to continue moving stuff out of my car. I left my phone in my room on accident. Whenever I tried to key back into my room, it didn't work. My key card had been invalidated (I tried every door, and other people's keys worked), and my dog was stuck in my room. Normally I would call security, but I didn't have my phone. A security car was driving past, and I ran after them waving and yelling for help. They drove away. I had to break through my window in order to get in. The next morning I called security, and they told me the **only** lady who was authorized to remake key cards was not in until tomorrow. This meant my ""early"" move in became be moving in on the first day of classes, which led to a slue of other issues.

Now, I have been locked out of my room again. My key is invalidated and if I want in my room, it means calling security and waiting anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. I called to be let in, and when they arrived I told the worker this is the second time this has happened to me, and we need to figure out a way for me to get my key replaced today. My service animal is currently sick, and this means potty trips every 20 minutes or so. Propping doors open is not an option, since you go through three doors to get outside and lots of people in and out of the halls. I was told that he would ""see what he could do"" and walked away without telling me any other information. We went back and forth for a few minutes on what supervisors need to be contacted, and who I would be hearing from.

A few minutes later I received a call from our VC, saying there is essentially nothing that can be done besides call security or her. Both of these things take \~30 minutes, if I'm lucky. Overall, our security system is broken. If the one woman who is allowed to remake our cards turned up dead, they would have another security officer do it. I should be able to have my card replaced during the weekend, not just Monday-Friday 8am-5pm.

My parents have been supportive this whole time, they send me  $ 170 every month for food and basic necessities and another  $ 150 for my dorm.

This is enough to get by every month but it's really close and taxing since I have to check prices on everything and watch my account balance every day. Worst thing is that I can't even go out with friends, because if I do, then I need to ask for more money. (I really don't want to).

This led to me looking for a part time job, just something which could give me a bit more money so I can stop worrying about it. I found a few listings, but my mum always tells me to just focus on school and don't worry about it. That I should just ask if I need more money.

But I'm tired of asking for money like some little kid, it makes me feel bad. So how can I convince my mum that I can manage a part time job with school at the same time?

Edit: I've talked with my parents. We came to a compromise. They will send me more money $40 for now and we'll see if that fixes it. It will certainly give me a bit more leeway. And I'll wait until at least next semester (which starts in September) and he start looking for a paid internship, since that seems like a great balance between money and experience (which is always necessary).

I applied undecided because I have broad interests and didn’t want to box myself into anything before I’ve even finished all of my high school classes. The past few months I’ve been doing some serious research into potential majors and careers, and I only see negative discussions everywhere I look.

The main career path I’ve been considering is law; but in all online spaces for lawyers and law students, they say that law school isn’t worth it and that you’ll inherently end up in hundred’s of thousands of dollars worth of debt you can never pay off, and that you’ll hate your life all through law school and for the whole duration of your legal practice.

So scratch that.

I’ve loved math classes my whole life and am taking college-level math classes in high school. Maybe I could major in math and—nope. Apparently the job market is basically nonexistent for anyone not in statistics. And even then it’s not guaranteed that you’ll make good money.

Scratch that too.

Humanities degrees are apparently all useless. I’ve seen people even say that STEM degrees outside of tech and engineering are also largely useless. And not one professional in any of the fields I’ve ever felt interest in has positive things to say.

It’s impractical to not be money obsessed even though I don’t want to be. Everyone seems to be pessimistic about college and life thereafter. And I understand why reality pushes people toward that mindset. But I have absolutely no confidence going into college that I’ll be able to commit to a subject which interests me that is also able to open doors for me to live comfortably, and balance quality of life and earning potential.

Is everything actually so bad? I don’t really have anyone in my life that has an apparent direct application between their degree and their career, and I know a lot of people in debt. It’s just really troubling.",college

However, there has been some issues.
So there's an English class I take. The professor enjoys talking to the students. He tends to joke and banter alot but at least he's more tame with it towards me. But of course because of that, sometimes the students and will banter and tease each other as well and with the professor sometimes.
However, there's this one classmate (25f) in the course who does join in the bantering with others. However she has starting to somewhat pick on me. She seems to be the type to hide it with ""it's a joke"" but even if she was, she's not that ignorant. She could tell I feel uncomfortable around her. I did try to ignore her but it's been getting out of hand. Unlike my professor, she doesn't care when she's going too far. She seems to like getting a negative reaction from others, especially from ME.
I don't know exactly why nor do I care why because there's never a good reason to continuously do something that will make someone uncomfortable. She's literally an adult and still acting like some high school mean girl.

Yesterday, I finally spoke to my professor since he's been getting concerned with my mood shifts in class.
I told him everything. Despite me not knowing the girl's name, he does. He at least understood how I felt. He even stated how while he does enjoy the bantering and teasing in class, he will not tolerate it if it goes too far, especially if someone is getting uncomfortable. He told me that he'll do something about it and have a word with her.

I hope he means it. I could be wrong but I noticed how college seems to take bullying/harassment more seriously than middle/high school.
Even if my professor's gonna take care of it, I still wonder if there's a way to get her name, just in case she attempts on retaliating. I could try using the student portal/Canvas but my professor doesn't use it, he just emails us for class announcements and reminders.

Now I've hit the point where I'm questioning my decision after reading posts about people having trouble being accepted as a business major. Should I change and go through with a CS degree or was Marketing the right choice because it's my weakness? 

My thought process was that since I love CS that I'm willing to learn it on my own without financial risk and can physically prove it with my own projects; if I threw myself out of my comfort zone in Marketing that it would force me to finally learn something I desperately need (and can learn how to run my own business).

Anyone have an opinion on this?",college

1036,1708800183.0,My roommates are greedy and lazy and I can’t take it anymore,"To preface, I live with 3 other guys in a single floor apartment, and they’re genuinely all good guys. We get along well, play basketball together, go out together on the weekends, and generally just all spend a lot of time together. However, they do not do anything in terms of cleaning, and they are so inconsiderate. 

We run the dishwasher every night and every morning I return from my 8:30 am class, empty it, reload it, and do any other dishes. My roommates wake up before I get home, eat breakfast, leave their dishes in the sink, and then go back to bed until about noon. This leaves me to clean up their mess even though they had all the time in the world to do the dishes and clean up. 

Also, we have 2 bathrooms and I clean both almost weekly because they get so disgusting- also I only ever use one of them so i’m cleaning a bathroom comprised entirely of other peoples messes. We’ve lived here for a year and I’m the only one who has ever cleaned a bathroom. Trash and recycling fill up quickly, and again, aside from maybe once or twice I’m the only person who has ever taken trash out. They can be overflowing and people will just balance stuff on top.

Aside from kitchen, bathrooms, and trash, I’m also the only one who will ever sweep, vacuum, wipe down a table, clean out the fridge, anything. The thing that’s been getting to me recently though is how inconsiderate they are. I wake up the earliest out of everyone, but recently one of my roommates has been waking up around 7 am to work out. I’ve been woken up every day this past week to him watching Tik Toks at maximum volume in the kitchen (yes he owns airpods and just refuses to use them). Also, I’ll get home from a long day, or the gym and see the kitchen is an absolute mess, and my roommates are playing video games 15 feet away. I clean up everything and they don’t even bat an eye or say a word. 

Also, my roommates parents pay for 100% of their things- rent, groceries, beer, new shoes, everything. I, however, pay for everything myself using money i’ve saved up from serving in a restaurant. When I buy groceries, it hurts my pockets, when they buy groceries it’s a venmo request to their parents. Lately, they’ve just been taking my stuff without asking which is such a bummer considering I literally worked to be able to get those things for myself

I'm not even sure if this is the right sub-reddit to be asking, considering most of the posts consist of Americans posting about their daily college life and such, or if there's even any Australians that might be able to recommend QLD Uni's, or relevant courses lol. But here I am, anyway.

I'm about 2 years, including this one, away from graduation, and I'm genuinely stuck between nothing and more nothing -- I \*know\* my interests, and what I have a passion in, but it's genuinely so hard to find those in a high-paying job. I'd just like a livable salary that would support me in brisbane (Can you tell I live in a small country town lol), or any larger city, really -- of which ensures I live both comfortably renting out an apartment, and that i can put away for future plans. (e.g. Travelling,((very much so an important aspiration of mine)), shopping, etc.)

I've just got 0 clue on what I want to study alongside my foreign language degree (of which will probably be German as I'm in love with Germany, it's culture and it's language, and have been for a long, long while - but I'm very, very willing and want to learn a variety of others throughout my lifetime -- mainly european. Italian, Finnish, Polish, and possibly Russian (although I doubt my ability to do so, haha.) But I'm stuck on what to pair that with as a duel degree. Teaching at a high-school or primary level doesn't appeal to me, but if that's really my smartest option, than I'm willing, but I feel as though it'd waste away my other interests.

I'm interested in history, but I feel that I'd not want to pursue a career in it. Politics, different cultures/ languages, geography and international law/european law appeals to me greatly, but at the same time nothing seems to pay well. An international relations degree spiked my interest, but I've looked into that many times it feels like, and I'm uncertain to weather I'd be able to find a concrete job post graduation.  


I probably sound like a broken record, but different cultures, languages and political relations interest me greatly, and I'd very much so like a job in relation to that...but I'm moreso focused on a high salary tbh -- my main goal is to travel.

Linguistics was an option - but again, shitty pay that could definitely NOT support me in the city. It feels like in Australia there's medical, and IT career paths, and those are your only hopes at getting decent pay.

Right now, i'm looking into computational linguistics, or doing a business/foreign language degree. Otherwise, I'm lost.

It feels like I've been searching for about 2 straight years, finding something that remotely interests me, and then seeing the salary/what it entails and straying away.

If anybody could suggest uni courses to combine with a foreign language degree, and the potential careers I might find myself with if i pursued studying it, or even advice, I'd greatly appreciate it. Thanks!

Not sure if I should try reporting him to the dean and/or file a complaint through the school's official channels, or if it might do more good to talk to a lawyer.

The TL;DR is that he's a toxic, fragile manipulator with a weird problem with autistic students who is reportedly slandering me behind my back to other students by saying things about me that he knows for a fact aren't true.  He also actively sabotoged my thesis project by privately slandering me to a vital group member, who went from being really excited to work with me to treating me abusively and almost bailing.

He's fragile about me asking questions in class, even though I do it with respect for his expertise.  He takes it all as personal attacks.  He gaslights me in front of the whole class and uses whataboutism or literally lies when called out by others.

He discriminates against the noticably autistic student, to the point where lots of us are noticing and it makes us uncomfortable.  I, myself, am a little bit on the spectrum, and I can't help but wonder about discrimination.

He plays favorites, hard.  He chooses 1-2 studetns per year to treat far better than the rest despite the performance of others; he emails his chosen favorites job opportunities that he doesn't tell the rest of us about; he refuses to teach the rest of us how to even find those opportunities on our own (he still makes about half his income off that type of work himself, despite being a full-time professor, so there's a very clear conflict of interest there).

CS + Linguistics

Pros:

\- Pretty synergistic with CompSci like with natural language processing

\- I don't know if UIUC has a decent linguistics program or not

She is callous, rude and unhinged, but I blame myself the very first day I met her. I asked her please I would love to have you check out this roommate agreement so that we can know how each other’s likes are and dislikes and make sure that each of us are comfortable, what do you say she immediately deflected and said no you can give that to management I have no need for that. I should’ve realized that was a red flag in itself.

Let’s fast forward to today, where I finally moved away from her after two or three police calls initiating a disorderly conduct report as well as the theft report because she stole my bag and wrote her name all over it. I had to fly all the way to San Diego get a receipt and prove that the bag was mine for them to acknowledge her theft , that’s not the worst part. The worst is management is doing very little about it until I can provide the police reports which they will be here next week but it’s just been frustrating because I have been studying taking care of a not well parent and nursing an injury for the last six months as a navy veteran, who is just trying to start over and do something meaningful so the my  life. i’ve never posted on Reddit before but I thought I would share this cute little video I created on YouTube shorts if it speaks to you please I would be happy for you to watch it and subscribe and follow the journey of escaping this awful roommate. I know he might say well. What did you do in the matter often, I tried avoiding conflict at all times. For example, if she was out in the living room, I would stay in my room. The only time I would come out is to cook, and whenever I would come out and cook is when she would start harassing me I can’t stay inside my apartment and not eat so I would avoid the general spaces so I could avoid her. She always initiated issues until I had to get the police involved. It just got to be too much. If there’s anyone who’s experiencing roommate please comment below or share a time when you had a horrible roommate and let me know how I can help you thanks for reading.

1058,1708745300.0,Need Opinions About Grade ,"So recently I turned in an assignment that required a flow chart like figure for around half the marks. I worked really hard on this, organizing everything but when the final product came out despite my text being appropriate font the format of the figure (used in Canva) came out very small. 

The rubrics specifically stated the figure must be large enough to be legible! I knew this. 

I attached the figure to the paper half of my assignment and the words were illegible without zooming in the document. 

I then almost fail the assignment because the figure portion goes unmarked due to the diagram being not legible. 

I know I messed up. And I want to talk to my prof about solutions but I’m uncertain as to how to proceed with regards to that conversation. I knew the font had to be large enough to be legible, it was if you zoomed in. I know that’s borderline, but I feel cheated because I know I worked hard on the information in the figure. Any ideas on how to approach this with my prof?

1063,1708731807.0,Exclusion Letter Changed My Life,"Being in an EU University is not an easy thing i'd say. Especially when that university is ranked among the top ones (let's say top 50) in Europe. I should've known that when i decided to study there. I did not. Back in 2022 i received an explusion letter from my university stating poor academic performance (i.e. i failed a course 2 times).As a record, i could not focus in the online lectures, barely cared about doing my hw correctly (even though i never skipped a single one), would not study for the exams, just shift my attention to gaming and movie-watching. I failed an exam twice in normal period, and twice in the retake exam session. In the end, I received the exclusion letter. BOOM. 

I started panicking, crying, not sleeping, having nightmares when barely sleeping, falling into depression, thinking about hurting myself, how would i tell my parents who have sacrificed everything for me to be a university student in such a prestigious university. I had 1 month to appeal the decision. I started wandering around the campus, asking my professor, my director, about my chances of successful appeal, since i was just struggling with that subject whereas i had barely passed the others. I started drafting the letter while at the same time following lectures + doing HW of the new semester. I'd spend 2 hours a day making my appeal letter as good as possible. 

&#x200B;

I knew my chances of being dismissed were enough to make me think of this every single minute of the day. Letter is finished, i read it again and again, i send it 1 day before the deadline. Days pass, weeks pass, my mental health is worsening, but i am doing my best onto the new semester in order to show my professors i am not an irresponsible douchebag anymore. The scenarios in my head are coming and going. How will i tell my mom if i get dismissed? What will my dad do when he finds out? 

&#x200B;

Roughly 45 days later, i get a response from the secretary while being in a lecture. It is a YES. APPEAL ACCEPTED. Professors agreed on giving me one more chance to continue my studies.I was for a day the happiest person in the world. Nothing could have described my happiness back then. I figure out for the following semester i need to sit my ass down and study the course i had to pass, otherwise if i failed it again, probably they wouldnt even give me the chance to appeal this time. New semester comes, i devote at least 2 hrs/day onto that course, practicing, doing exercises etc. Midterm -> 120/100 (20 bonus points). Final (100/100). Final Grade 10/10.

&#x200B;

Today i just GRADUATED from the university with an average GPA of 8.01. I never thought i'd make it this far when i received that letter. I have not told anyone about this experience, only the staff at uni and you reddit guys know about this.

&#x200B;

I still have the exclusion letter in my desk, and i'm looking forward to taking a photo of it next to my diploma, just to show anyone that everything is possible, if you put on hard work, time and dedication.  Being consistent always pays off, sooner or later.

I recently received a 95% on an essay to which the teacher called it “imperfect” and it sent me spiraling. I spoke to him after class and asked what i could do better and he goes “is an A not good enough.” The problem isn’t that I received an A, the problem is that I’m terrified that I will not understand his exact wants and will receive lower than an A. 

I also recently had a math exam and received a 19/20 on the quiz and a 90% on the exam. I saw someone had received a 97% on the exam and I instantly felt like I didn’t work hard enough and that I should’ve gotten a 100%. Now I’m crying in my bathroom because she hasn’t posted exam #2 and I’m terrified I failed it. It’s so prevalent that I’ve been having nightmares over receiving my test and it being a D.

1066,1708729931.0,Disclosing Health issues to Professors ,"I have accessibility because I have Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. I  am a 25 year old female. I have a plethora of comorbid health issues that go along with my lupus. I have had chronic migraines since I was 9 years old (treating them now) and have struggled with my mental health since I was a child. My mental health is effected by my lupus and vice versa. I have ADHD (currently untreated for health reasons, but am working on resuming treatment again) 

I took two years off from university after withdrawing for medical reasons spring of 2021, I was a sophomore. 

I did not always excel in school as a child. I was held back in 1st grade and put in special education classes as well as services. I worked hard to test out of them in middle school and successfully I did ! In high school I still used extra time on exams, but  struggled academically for mental health reasons. 

Fast-forward to now:
I started back at University last semester. I obtained accessibility services for my lupus. I made myself really proud and achieved a 4.0 with a full course load. I work part time as well. I am now a junior. 

However, this semester so far has been rough for a couple reasons. I am taking an extremely hard course required for my major with an excellent, but intense professor. I would LOVE to be able to do research with this professor, but at this point I doubt its going to happen (but that's not the point). 

I got Covid for the first time two weeks ago and I have had to go without  my lupus medication because of it. I've been feeling sick from recovering from covid and my body is responding to being off the proper medication. 

I had  my really hard Class Wednesday night (5:30-8:40), I stayed until 9:20 because I was struggling due to feeling super out of it and struggling to focus. I felt overwhelmed and overstimulated. 

I handed in my work, but I knew I could have done better. My body is going through it right now and my mind is mirroring it. The deficit im experiencing isn't effecting my other classes as severely because they are earlier in the day. 

I emailed my professor apologizing for the state of my work that I handed in and saying I am dealing with, ""physical and mental issues"" and that I will put in place ""interventions"" to focus better in class come next class. 

Is this inappropriate? I have accessibility so I believe I should be open with my professors when I feel I'm effected by my illnesses. 

I was super professional in my email. This teacher has worked so hard with me so far this semester and I just don't want them to feel like I don't appreciate it.

I think growing up I was conditioned a lot of the time to enjoy learning when I knew I could get a good grade on the test, and this is the experience a lot of other students deal with as well. 

I just feel like a dullard, not that I can’t study or retain any information, but that I can’t apply the information or have discussions about what I’m learning. I’ve relied on wrote memory and feel very intimidated by critical thinking skills and always feel challenged even with basic critical thinking. I don’t like myself for it and wonder if I’m wasting my time in college and wasting my parent’s money. 

I can study, but it has constantly been an uphill battle for me over the last several years.

1081,1708720488.0,How did you decide on a major?,"Hoping for advice!
I graduated from high school almost two years ago now and finally decided that it's about time to continue with my life. I have the motivation again, but I'm stuck on one thing: I don't know what to study. 

My two top choices are account and computer science. I took high school classes for both of them, and had a decent experience with them both.

In accounting I did really well. It was largely self taught and independent. It was tedious, but not difficult. My grade never dropped below a 97. To say I enjoyed it would be a stretch, but I managed to make it through without complaint. Once I got focused, the work went by fast, and seeing all the numbers laid out cleanly was satisfying.

As for my programming classes, they went... not so well. It was less my own ability and moreso the fact that I was heavily medicated at the time, leading to insane drowsiness, passing out in the library, and more often than not missing the bus to the tech center because of it. I never did care for it, either. I only went because I've heard all sorts of things about it being in demand. I do have a passing interest in game dev, but only for things like visual novels that don't require anything especially complex. Anyway, the little I did attend went... alright, I guess. It was certainly far more frustrating and didn't come as naturally to me. I still got an A, but that's not a big deal. 

I've always been a straight A student, even in classes I've struggled with. I've found that memorization and the drive to meet deadlines is what kept my grades high, and that my GPA does not translate to real world intelligence or the ability to perform well in a workplace environment.

As an aside, I am diagnosed autistic and agoraphobic. I have significant difficulty interacting with others, especially with strangers, especially considering that I am primarily nonverbal in real life. While I wouldn't say that a job that requires face-to-face social interaction is impossible, it would be difficult. I'd prefer something more independent, with minimal socialization (at least aloud- I have no issue talking online).

At the end of the day, though, I would say I'm much more of a humanities type than a STEM type. In an ideal world where most humanities degrees aren't seen as practically useless, I'd pursue my passion in a heartbeat. Unfortunately, college is expensive in America, and I don't have money to waste on following my dreams. Still, I sort of cling to the hope that someone will tell me it is worth pursuing my passion and that it wouldn't be completely stupid and a waste of money to study something I actually care about.

In any case, I just feel lost and confused and want to stop putting everything off. I don't know what I should do. Even if you don't have advice, I would appreciate hearing about similar experiences.

TL;DR: socially stunted autist who loves the humanities but wants to make enough money to not be homeless doesn't know what to major in because she's fucking stupid and can't decide anything for herself",college

I'm currently in my second year, and both last year and this year, our professors in our majors consistently assign activities like roleplays and singing, which aren't really my forte given that I'm an introvert.

I have two sisters: one graduated in BS Tourism, and the other is currently graduating in AB Psychology. Despite this, I'm considering changing my course. However, my family, particularly my dad, is quite traditional and has always envisioned me pursuing Criminology/PNP (Which I don't Like)

Feeling uncertain about my direction due to the pandemic's impact on my self-esteem and confidence, I sought guidance from a friend (who has an experience on Counseling). I expressed my broad interests and described myself as a Jack of All Trades, Master of None. I really don't know Where i'm good at and what I want anymore. The counselor suggested considering AB Psychology as a potential option for me.

I even joked about the idea of dropping out of college, suggesting that my brain isn't wired for complex thinking. In my defense, my friend pointed out that I don't have an average IQ and might excel in the sciences. Despite such remarks, I struggle with self-doubt and worry about the consequences of changing my course.

I can see how that would look good on a CV or resume if I go into more psych, but I don't know if grad schools would care about something completely unrelated like physics. On the other hand, I know I'd love it and know a professor who'd probably be willing to have me in his class (same one I took last year) as an undergraduate TA for the Fall 2024 semester.

I recently completed my bachelors in mechanical engineering from a university, and am now working as an automation engineer full time (not my thing). I have always been more interested in comp sci and don’t want to go through 4 years of bachelors so am thinking of getting my master in it to be able to move careers/ explore. 

1. Is it a good idea to do this as I will be behind everyone else. I can take boot camp classes to catch up a little but it’s not the same thing.

2. Ideally I would like to work full time and get the degree part time online. Is this a good idea? I know all these circumstances limit the university I can go to and such.

3. Is getting a master in comp science without a bachelor in it a good idea? Will it help with a job? I know jobs ask you to do tests to get the job will a masters help me achieve a passing grade.

4. How do I go about finding a uni that is good for my requirements? Recently moved to the Americas from Canada so.

1103,1708698310.0,I know how to make friends; now how do I find a friend *group* outside of the very beginning of the school year?,"Thanks for clicking to read, I love you.

**I want to start by saying I do indeed have friends.** Disparate friends from around my college that I hang out with occasionally. I know there are people here that struggle with finding even a single friend, and to those, PLEASE KEEP READING, I was in a similar spot, and I hope I can help you through sharing my experience.

So even though I do have friends, I have no friend group. That's due to the fact that my first few weeks here in uni were rough. I was an OOS student adjusting to a town I didn't know, was constantly busy shopping for things I needed, (I was out on my bike riding around alone when I wasn't in class) and had some mental hangups. I still needed to love myself for who I was, and constantly doubted anyone would care about my silly niche interests.

***It was before I learned the key to making friends isn't to be interesting, but to be interested in other people.***

I know that now, and I have zero problems making friends. I ask deep questions that really get a conversation going, listen carefully and let the other person do most of the talking. But alas, it feels like most people here cement into their friend groups during those first few weeks, when I was a hermit. And the funny part is, I DID have two orientation friend groups, TWO, but one stopped talking in the group insta chat, and seemed to split up into smaller sub-friend-groups. The other one stopped talking in the group text even though we did stuff for a week, my fault for not taking initiative and inviting people to do things that second week of school, I was still a shy, low self-esteem, poorly dressed fella.

And so, I got busy for a week, alone, and a week turned into three months, the loneliest 3 months of my life. So over winter break I spent literally the whole month reading books and watching videos on how to make friends.

So recently when I came back from winter break, I was determined to be social, and I was, I've been inviting people out to get food from time to time and have made new friendships here all by myself, without having to be introduced to them by someone I already know. Just by striking up a conversation in a social setting, and if it went well, I'd take em out to get lunch.

But not having a friend group where everyone knows each other is so damn hard because I NEVER get invited to do anything, I have to do all the inviting. I usually just invite someone to get lunch every now and then, but not having a group where everyone knows each other makes it so fucking exhausting man, and since I have to do all my socializing in different pieces, I can only dedicate so much time to each, rather than being able to combo it and form many deep friendships all at once. So, what do I do? I got over my self-esteem issues, I know all the rules of making friendships, dress well, treat people well, and take initiative to invite people to do things, but that doesn't change the fact that I was a hermit here during the time that mattered most, when friend groups were formed. Now I'm so socially isolated, lonely, exhausted from doing all the work, and haven't found ""my people"" what do I do?

I feel like it's a big ass ask to from a friend group where I'm the only mutual rn, everyone's already got one, and it would be much easier to inject myself into a pre-existing one. I'm just not sure what the best path forwards is for me.",college

In retrospect, the thing that I have enjoyed the most is math, something that I really wanted to be better at than anyone else.

1118,1708669332.0,Ungraded assigments right before midterm,"I need some advice regarding one of my professors. So I emailed him early last week asking about our midterm and how to best prepare, he mentioned studying the homework assignments for chapters 1-3. I thought, okay fair. At the time, we had submitted and received grades for Chapters 1 & 2 and I had just submitted Chapter 3 thinking, it would be graded by the weekend. I also asked him if the new material from Chapter 3 would be covered even though it wasn't part of the homework and he said it would be. I was annoyed that we hadn't had the chance to practice the new material but I was already feeling defeated. Well, the weekend came and our homework was not graded, instead, he assigned additional homework covering the rest of Chapter 3 but set a due date for after the midterm.

I've completed the most recent homework but the material isn't easy and there are people still working on the homework even though the midterm is tomorrow. I also have zero clue if I did it right or wrong and will have no way of knowing until after the midterm. Even if he grades it by the morning it's too late. Now, I realize I should've said something early this week expressing my concerns, but honestly, I was nervous to say anything. I have studied the material to the best of my abilities but I can't shake that I should say something anyway because I do believe that if universities are going to charge us an arm and a leg to get an education, the least they could do is have assignments graded before midterms so we can have feedback and study any material we have gaps in. I'm also shocked that this midterm is almost half our grade and we are being tested on stuff we don't even have feedback on.

Now this is where I'd like some feedback. Does this email sound okay? Should I send this before my midterm or should I wait to send a complaint after the midterm? Also, should I even complain to the professor, or should I go straight to the dean? My plan was to send this to my professor first and then escalate if needed. However, I am not sure what's appropriate here.

*Dear Professor \[\],*

*I am reaching out to express my concerns about the current state of the class, particularly in light of tomorrow's midterm.*

*As we approach the midterm, covering material from Chapters 1, 2, and 3, I have prepared for the exam to the best of my abilities. However, I am facing a challenging situation due to the ungraded homework assignments in Chapter 3.*

*One of the assignments for Chapter 3, which was due last week, remains ungraded. Additionally, Homework 4, covering the remaining material in Chapter 3, is due after the midterm. I firmly believe that receiving timely feedback on our assignments is essential to help us understand the material that we are tested on. Without this feedback, it becomes challenging for us, the students, to identify and address any gaps in our knowledge before the exam.*

*While I understand that grading is a time-consuming process, I would like to express the added stress and uncertainty caused by ungraded assignments, particularly in the proximity of a midterm that accounts for almost half of our grade.*

*While it may not be feasible to rectify the current situation, I would like to propose, if possible, assigning and providing feedback on assignments at least a week before exams in the future. This adjustment would significantly contribute to our preparation and enhance our confidence in approaching exams for this class.*

*Thank you for taking the time to address these concerns. I look forward to hearing from you.*",college

I'm a biology major neuro minor, and I tend to only work on school work and such for a couple hours (mayble 5-6 on average outside of class?) after class and don't take as much time to sit down and study as I should unless there is a test or something coming up. I feel like just the homework aspect takes up so much of my time. I spent about 4hrs total this week working  my developmental biology lab outside of lab time so that we could have everything ready by lab today. I have to write a micro publication by monday summerizing the data. I had to read one scientific article yesterday to write a paper brief about, and another one to make a presentation about (and worked with my group for about 2.5hrs last night to discuss that). Still need to work on the presentation for that and have my part done by monday and then make a separate presentation for the full discussion. I still need at least 9 more articles read and put together an annotated bibliography for a mini research proposal by next thursaday, plus an introduction outline for it. And then I still have some chapters to read for my other classes (abnormal psych and this US history class) that I need to get done by monday as well, plus just normal homework and some other projects. I've been working on all these things throughout the week as much as I can, but I feel like I haven't made a dent in it. I'm not sure if I just am not working long enough or not being productive enough or what",college

1128,1708658306.0,Will anything happen if I don't pay my college after dropping out?,"So I started college back in the Fall 2023 semester. I come from a low income household and single mother and had it not been for fafsa and a lot of work I wouldn't have been able to pay for my college. The problem arose when after winter break I had to pay for the Spring semester, as it turns out my family didn't have the money needed even for a payment plan and ultimately as I was unsure about what degree I wanted and wasn't doing super well I decided to withdraw.

&#x200B;

I of course expected to still owe some money, but the amount was quite surprising. For context the semester total was basically 13k, and after fafsa it was 6k, which we didn't have and led me to withdraw. I moved into my dorm the 16th of January and school started the day after, I submitted my withdrawal request the 22nd and it didn't get approved until the 26th. I was informed that I'd still owe 30% of the value because I ""left the 3rd week"" when really it should've been the 2nd week but they waited until Friday to accept me to make it appear as me leaving the 3rd week. I thought that meant 30% of 6k, which was not the case.

&#x200B;

After I withdrew, fafsa informed me that because I left they'd revoked the scholarship, which meant my charges rose to 13k, then after a few days my charges were finalized and I logged in to see that I owed 3.9k (30% of 13k). My two points here are 1. I find this amount quite excessive to charge for a 10 day stay. And 2. Is there a way to get out of this situation? I didn't have 6k to pay school and I do not have 4k either, my family lives paycheck to paycheck, not to mention I've been unlucky at finding a job.

&#x200B;

Will anything bad happen if I just chose not to pay the school? I have a deadline of the 23rd of February to sign up for a payment plan or I'll owe the full amount, so any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you for taking the time to read my very long post.",college

1130,1708654779.0,Struggling with Civil Engineering,"Struggling and no Idea what to do

Hey, so I've never really known what i wanted to do as a kid. I always had very broad interests that spanned across all things from technology, to history, to astronomy, biology, engineering, music, etc... picking a major choice based off of ""interest"" was ridiculous to me, because there was nothing i was interested in doing for WORK for the rest of my life.

So when i graduated high school i decided the best thing would be pick a major in an engineering that seemed to interest me the most. Good money+semi-interesting and engaging major and career. I landed on civil engineering as ive always enjoyed urban planning (simcity and cities skylines haha) and its one of the most broad degrees in engineering.

However, now in my second semester i am realizing how boned i am. I barely passed Precalc with a C+ my first semester, and now im drowining in calc 1 with derivatives and implicit differentiaion... same story with chem, barely passed chem 1, and im dying in chem 2... tools for civil is going alright but it's the only stem course im taking that i feel ""okay"" about. And even then just okay.

I dont want to play the mental health card, but theres certainly things ive been fighting there, ive been struggling with organization and keeping everything straight in my head so much that ive missed quizzes/a test and even some assignments needed before a speech for public speaking. And i have suicidal thoughts whenever i do mildly poor on anything and then they persist for weeks and weeks and make it hard to focus or do well, especially when i do poorly and it puts me into a loop. I detest the idea of going and getting ""help""  because it makes me feel weak and ineffective

Im almost certainly going to fail most if not all my courses this semester and i have no idea what to do about it. I want to drop out. Or change majors. Or take a break... but i see all my peers moving forward in their studies and careers, and i see the girl im dating moving forward in her human computer interactions studies and it just discourages me that these things come so easily to them. (And obviously none of it is EASY for anyone but, from a standpoint of they KNOW what they want and are passionate enough about it to not let themselves slip.) I feel like a walking failure, my parents want me to do better than them and this is how i fucking end up. Ill be lucky to be a walmart manager.

Sorry for the wall of text im just looking for advice on wheter or not I should just give up the major... i was planning on going into transportation as a discipline, if that matters at all. Thank you everyone so much! Hope you all have a good week and you pass all your courses ",college

Need someone to answer my interview questions!!,"Hi all, this is my last resort; for my Journalism class, I need an expert to answer some questions about Climate Change. It's about 6 questions, and please share your credentials or just DM me!! Thank you!!!

Many people this past winter voiced their concerns about climate change, more specifically in regards to the lack of snow their region received. Do you think this is a direct result of climate change, or just a coincidental weather pattern? Will it end up getting worse in our lifetimes, or should we expect winter snow-conditions to return to normal? 

A recent study showed that 43% of Americans found that climate change is causing harm to the quality of human life. Why isn’t this number higher? Why do we find that people struggle to acknowledge that the climate crisis is real? 

Approximately 65 million years ago, Earth experienced the 5th mass extinction event which wiped out the dinosaurs. Now, we are observing record-high rates of extinction of many types of species, including amphibians, which may go extinct completely by the end of the century. Is there a way to stop this?

What are some of the things that the average person can do to help the climate crisis, or is there nothing at all? Do you think that it is up to the world’s biggest carbon emitters to change? 

This past year, research has found that faith in the government is at an all-time low. Do you think the government is taking beneficial measures to combat climate change, or is it a facade? 

We are consistently told that there is nothing we can do about climate change–is this true? Are we going to see natural disasters caused by climate change in our lifetime because we cannot undo the damage that has been done? ",college

1153,1708630747.0,"Really frustrated, seeking guidance. ","TL;DR

Hello all, this is going to be a lengthy post but context is essential. As a result, I’m attempting to seek legal action against my university but I’ve never sued anyone before so I’m clueless. For confidentiality reasons the individuals involved will be renamed as follows:

Roommate - Joe

Roommate’s friend - Bob

Roommate’s super junkie friend - Gary

So Joe would bring two of his friends over. Every day they would come, smoke upstairs and stay up late into the night going in and out the house. Gary and his friend (who I later got into an altercation with) both sold drugs and did drugs. The reason I say this is because I grew up in the hood and I know certain behaviors. If you’re in and out over and over again throughout the night and day you’re either using, selling, or both. Since they offered stuff hella times that was obvious. But I noticed they looked real scruffy often and didn’t have much so then using was also obvious. Joe’s friend Bob was always in our townhouse (6 total roommates including myself). 

The dude would pop in without knocking, run through to go upstairs and leave shit unlocked, he became an unofficial roommate. I spoke to all my roommates a bunch of times about boundaries, taking shit without asking, messes, etc. and nothing really changed. Flash forward a bit, one day while my nephews were over Joe knocked on my door asking for a bandage (for context I coparent with my mom to take care of the boys because my brother passed and would take them on the weekends). 

I went out, and saw a white male with his head split open (Gary). He apparently got hit by a car and stayed the night limping and also going in and out the house, he refused to go to the hospital (which is fishy and I quickly realized he was lying). The next day his family came to our dormitory asking his whereabouts, concerned for him as he was missing. 

Bob who I mentioned earlier (who I got into an altercation with) began living in the dorm. Not only was he living there, his CHILD and MOTHER of his child were in Joe’s room as well, with Joe and his friend sleeping on the couches for several days at a time. 

Bob and Joe kept taking people’s belongings such as food and more, which resulted in me just getting a mini-fridge, but then they moved on to other people’s shit.  

One of my roommates recalled Bob looking into his room while he was in the bathroom and when he asked him what he was doing he said he was “looking for an xbox controller”. 

When my nephews stayed over I was informed Bob was looking at their PlayStation while they were sleeping. There were also several times Bob and Gary would be nodding off in the living room so clearly I stopped bringing my nephews over bc of the environment. 

Then on December 10th a day after my birthday, a $300 Bape hoodie of mine disappeared. I asked everyone, looked everywhere, and one of my roommates and two of his friends said they saw Bob wearing it. Bob didn’t return for some time which was weird as he was consistently at the dorm since the semester started and 

Joe began giving me weird energy and ignoring me after I brought up the hoodie in our dorm group chat. 
I then did the right thing and informed my RA, he laughed a lot and said he couldn’t do anything until January because of finals but he would tell his supervisor. (For those wondering why I waited so long to report, I felt sympathy for the dudes and didn’t want them to get in trouble for being at their lowest, to me food is food and fuck it. I’ve dealt with addicts my whole life so I just saw it as people struggling). 

January would be too long and was confusing as a literal trespasser and thief could return at any moment.  I then spoke to the dean, he said that he would speak to Joe and remove him but it would take some time. 

Two weeks went by and while we were decorating a Christmas tree, Bob entered the apartment. I kindly asked him about the hoodie and if he knew it’s whereabouts because he was the only one I hadn’t asked, I wasn’t accusing him. He then attacked me and I didn’t attack him back, my roommate and I used force to push him out and he said “Stay right here, I’ll be right back” threatening me. 

I called the police and they said nothing could be done as I didn’t know his name but if I called while he was there again he could be trespassed. Afterwards for 4 HOURS both Joe and Bob threatened and insulted my roommate and I and claimed we “jumped him” because we both forcibly removed him. 

Joe also called me the N-word as a white male. The threats continued via message and phone call until I blocked them. I had proof, documentation, and screenshots of EVERYTHING. I brought it to my disciplinary hearing, gave it to the dean, and my innocence was proved and I was moved somewhere else. 

About a month goes by and the whole time I’ve been calling attorneys, little to no responses, and I would think I have a right to sue? Just yesterday after all the hearing had been wrapped up for some weeks, lo and behold I run into Joe and I’m under the assumption he’s been expelled, suspended, or SOMETHING. But no, he’s just back to school like nothing happened. 

Crazy thing is after the altercation transpired, my roommate and I were moved, but Joe remained on the housing the entire time (info from my other roommates). When we were moved to a dorm that nobody ever chooses because it has old plumbing, old air, and heat that does not work in the middle of the winter in NJ. It seemed like we were getting punished as the victims. 

Joe was the only white male in our household in a living space full of black and a puerto rican dude and faced no repercussions for not only saying the n-word but threatening us while doing it for HOURS. Police reports, and a whole bunch of bs collected and filed for nothing. Again, this all happened in NJ and I just want help going through with this legally. I’m tryna leave the hood and somehow bs like this follows me lol. ",college

1157,1708628020.0,concerning behavior from friend…,"Hi everyone! So over this past week one of my friends has been expressing some concerning behavior. 

I know he struggles a lot with his mental health and I totally understand that. This past week however, it seems to have escalated. 

He’s told me that he’s pretty sure he wants to drop out after this semester and has already canceled housing.

Hes struggled a bit academically (mostly just getting motivated) and has diagnosed ADHD. However that’s not the primary reason for wanting to leave. It seems like the catalyst has been the housing situation (campus shortage of rooms) and the possibility of having a roommate next semester, as he is in a private room currently. 

Although I think this reasoning is a little odd, ive been supportive. However now, it seems like he’s spiraling. 

If he drops out there will be nowhere for him to live as he doesn’t have a job and cannot move back with his family since they found out he is gay. He’s essentially fucked himself over. 

I’ve tried to provide suggestions (like talking with disability services about room accommodations since he has documentation for health issues) but it doesn’t seem like he’s willing to take advice. (perhaps self sabotage?)

He’s also been posting a lot on private stories about wanting to d*e and feeling like he has no purpose. 

I’ve been talking to him everyday and now it’s to the point im considering anonymously reporting him to our school’s counseling center. My concern is that because I’m the only person talking to him about this, he’ll realize it’s me and this could cause him to spiral worse. I just don’t know what to do. Any advice is welcome.

1161,1708624746.0,Quickest path to BA degree after LONG break,"25 years ago I walked away from my university with only one credit left to earn my BA in Sociology. I received a work opportunity I felt I couldn't pass up and decided to delay completion of my thesis. Despite my intentions, I found myself in the workforce in a new city and new life-focus and never took the time to do it. I now have over 20 years in the software industry in a career where my peers typically have CIS degrees and/or an MBA. 

I was recently laid off from my job of 15 years and on the job hunt. I think my professional experience should be enough to ensure I land on my feet, but many job openings require a degree and automatic resume scanning may instantly disqualify my application.

So I want to see how I could go about getting a bachelor's degree in the easiest and cheapest way possible. As long at it is an accredited institution I don't think I care who grants it to me.

At the time Sociology was a great match with my youthful desire to change the world and bring down the systems that oppress us. I was a good student, but I can't say I've held onto much passion for the subject nor many memories of the coursework. And I no longer have any of my notes, papers or textbooks.

So I'm open to shifting to a different major - Business or CIS would be most relevant to my career, but I feel finishing with Sociology would be the quickest path.

When i finished high school y told my mon i wanted to get a degree in Sound Engineering thats what i wanted to study, my mother proceeded to tell me that im not studying that because ""Thats not a real carreer"" and told me to pick another thing, so basically i found myself forced to pick another carreer that i didn’t wanted to study, (Its important to say that im the type of person that wants to be free, i hate my life being controlled by other people and not me, and at this point i feel like i im not even the owner of my own life, everyone takes the decisions i have to take, and i end up doing whatever the other people want, not what i want, it happened multiple times before and it’s happening again)

Making the story short i am currently 2 semesters in, failing like 4 of 7 classes because i don’t even feel motivated to do it, i mean im trying, but the motivation its not there, and im not even having time for making music because college just takes all my time, i feel like i am in the worst point of my life since i was born.

its also good to mention that my mom gets really irritated over money problems, or loosing money in general, she already payed those semesters so telling her now that i want to quit would just ruin the relationship whit my mother, but im not really see me going trough those for years of college and graduating.

I graduated college  7 years ago, but I was planning on returning to college to retake courses and pursue med school.

My situation was that a friend of mine cheated on my final exam in one of my science classes.
I went to my lab professor since she was the only one I could get in touch with and said that my friend and I was cheating during our final exam. The professor who gave the final exam went on a trip right after final exams and never heard from him again.

The grade I received in that class was an F.
No asterisk or anything out of the usual.
Also on my transcript it said I was in good academic standing every semester.

I never received an email, or had to have a meeting with the dean or academic integrity officer or professor.
I never signed any forms.
I received an just an F.
No asterisk. No weird grade I never seen before that would raise eyebrows.

I just want to know how do you know if it shows a person have violated academic integrity on their transcript.

1178,1708607005.0,35 year old high school dropout out with a G.E.D.,"(Didn't mean to put ""out"" after ""dropout"" in the title)

So I'm thinking of pursuing a career as a radiology tech but wondering if maybe I'd be in over my head. 

My wife is going to school for nursing right now so I won't be able to start school untill she finishes the nursing program and starts working. At that point I plan to quit my job and go to school full time.

What worries me is that I haven't been in school since high school, so that'll be about 20 years without any schooling by the time I would start my first semester. So I fear that I'm going to struggle greatly because of this.

Also we have 3 young daughters. Whom of which will be in school all day while I'm studying/doing homework/ or in class. Which will be nice and give me a lot time to do those things. But I'm wondering if trying to juggle being a husband and a father to 3 kids while going to school full time will be too much. 

But what worries me the most is the fact that I don't consider myself to be very smart. Just very motivated.  I am motivated to do something with my life and have a career I can be proud of. I work 12 hour days in a machine shop right now and just can't imagine myself doing this for the next 30 something years. 

Here's what concerns me the most. I have a terrible memory.  It's awful.  And I'm so scared of quitting my job to go to school full time and then not be able to retain the information that I'm studying. 

1 major difference will be the amount of sleep that I get. I get 5 hours of sleep every night now, and I think that might be playing a major role in my awful memory. Whereas once I quit my job and start school, I'll be able to get 8 hours of sleep every night, and I'm just hoping and praying that will make a major difference for me cognitively.

1201,1708569975.0,Feeling lost during college and what to do after,"Hello,

This is the first time I'm using Reddit, so I apologize.

I'm 21 and in my fourth year at university. I plan on going another year but I've been a bit scared. My mother and my therapist tell me I'm doing amazing coming from a low income family where graduating is a pipe dream(? i think that's a saying) but I really feel like I haven't learned anything. I'm told I'm smart and I love my major but I don't think I could recall a single thing I learned about it. I skate through my courses  with average grades and every year someone asks ""what do you want to do after college?"" . It scares me that I still don't know. I chose my degree because I love the topic and thought ""well if I don't want to go already, I'll be able to get through it if it's something I'll love, I'll figure out what to do with it later. Just get A degree."" Now I sit with graduation creeping up closer and closer. My friends are all in positions where they can use the knowledge they have acquired to start thinking of ways to change the world. How? They talk about writing papers to appeal to the college body and that amazes me. I feel really alone and I feel like an outcast amongst my peers. Any advice or similar feelings?

1209,1708561075.0,Should I just pull the trigger and change my major? I can't stand it anymore.,"My current major is History and I literally can't do this anymore. I got to the VERY end of my major, I have one class left which is my capstone that I am currently taking and I can't do this. I don't have the ability to critically think, create, and contribute to meaningful discussions. I don't know how to do research either, well historical research.

The thing is though, this course was supposed to introduce me to these topics because NONE of the history classes that I've had before required me to do my own research, very rarely have I had required reading but it was often a short historical article and not three chapters from a monograph that I need to read in 3 days and create critical questions to discuss in class. I should have skills that I was never taught.

But besides that, I've taken a liking to language learning, particularly Spanish, and it's something I would like to major in. I had to take Spanish courses because a foreign language (up to sophomore level) is required and I fell in love with it.

The problem is, as I said, I will be giving up at the very last second, I'm in the VERY last course of this major, and that would be THREE years down the drain, my time wasted, my parents' money wasted. I'm not graduating next semester, it's planned next but still, that's going to add another 2 or 3 years.

Ugh, I don't know what to do. I could just brace and try to finish it but how it's currently going in my capstone is that I have an annotated bibliography due tomorrow. And I need TEN entries, a mix of books and articles. I have three. And that's from more than a WEEK of trying to figure out what my topic is, which I still don't have a clear idea plus I could fail it. 

I've cried almost every day for the past few weeks because of this class, and I can't take it anymore. I'm sleep-deprived, and I'm feeling something that I can't say in this sub but I imagine it's a common reaction. I feel like a failure. I should've realized this earlier. I mean I started feeling this way even last spring and I thought I could push through it but it is clear that I can't.

So, what should I do? Pull the trigger and change it? Or just keep going and see if I can make past this semester alive.",college

I am a junior college student at a big public university. I’m in a sorority, which did help me meet people my freshman year especially. 

I consider myself to have good people skills, I don’t really have an issue talking to people. I have great grades, I’m not hideous looking. I have a picture of myself on my profile if you’re curious. I live in an apartment with a roommate I barely see, and I come to campus every day for classes. I’m always at the sorority house eating or studying, and I go to the gym and the library often. I smile at people and I make conversation. I have really gotten out of my comfort zone and I have started initiating conversation more but people tend to not give you much to work with.

I actually do have a few “friends/acquaintances” but whenever I ask them to hangout they often have some excuse not to. I have 2 close friends here, one is studying abroad right now and the other is incredibly flakey and hard to make plans with.

I’ve joined clubs on campus, I volunteer, and I’m part of a research organization on campus. I’m “friends” with everyone there, but it never goes anywhere, as in, we never actually hang out. We just talk and joke during our meetings but thats it. 

I have friends back home but they all went to different colleges. I actually had a fairly big friend group in high school.

I'm doing rather well in my classes, whilst juggling a part-time job, a healthy social life, and my hobbies when I have the energy for them. There's just one issue which has been plaguing me for the past month or so, maybe even a little longer: I CAN BARELY STAY AWAKE IN MY CLASSES SOMETIMES

For instance: I've already fallen asleep twice in my film class, to the point where my friend had to wake me up to prevent me from napping through the rest of the period. In my myths and poetry course, I've almost fallen asleep two or three times at this point, having another close-call today in which I just barely managed to keep my eyes open. I've also had one or two close calls in my Native American Literature course, and I've come very close to dozing off in my Sociology lecture too. 

I know people will ask questions about it, so let's review some basic details about my lifestyle: on Mondays and Wednesdays, I have to wake up fairly early in order to make it on-time to the aforementioned part-time job. (7:10am on Mondays, 8:10am on Wednesdays.) On weekdays, I go to bed no later than 12:45/1am, resulting in about 7-8 hours of sleep each weeknight (occasionally 9 if I'm super lucky). My diet is not the \*best,\* but I'm trying to incorporate more fruits, vegetables, etc. I'm on a few different medications which have the potential to make me feel more tired, which is probably the most important detail to mention. If I had to guess, they're certainly contributing to these tired feelings, but perhaps they're not the entire cause. 

But hey! What I'm really here for is tips on how to mask my tiredness during class. My current professors are super chill and haven't gone apeshit on me yet for being a little drowsy, but I'm worried to test their patience, cause we all have limits.

1234,1708542860.0,Disliking my current major,"So I’m currently a computer science major at my local community college. 

I started out as business with the intent to transfer to a 4 year to do accounting but discovered I enjoyed math after taking a stats course and ultimately switched to CS. I did enjoy my economics course(s). 

Now I’m at calculus 2 and while hard, I do like it but I absolutely cannot stand my computer science course I’m taking this semester and before (that may be because my programming teacher was garbage but still). I enjoyed my hardware course and discrete structures I’m taking currently but even then. 

I’m not really sure what to do as while I’m not struggling in these CS courses, I’m not enjoying them like I do with math. That said, I’m afraid of pursuing a pure math degree (up until CC I was a very poor student, so a little insecurity if I can do math or not and so far I’ve been doing it). 

Im open to any advice. ",college

1237,1708541346.0,I'm losing the motivation to finish my BS and I need guidance,"TLDR - I have a full year left for my degree plan (if everything falls into perfect alignment which is at like 40% alignment currently) and I wonder if I should transfer colleges to something local or stick it out and be hopeful.

I am currently in my 5th or 6 year of trying to complete my bachelor's. I BS-ed a lot in high school and my early college years, along with changing majors 3 times. I am currently pursuing a degree in UX design (yes, yes I know. I joined the post-COVID trend) and am going to a school out of state pursuing the degree online. I have talked to my advisor on several occasions about how I am out of state, to which she has always assured me ""I can complete this degree online"". Today, we had a discussion because I am at a point where I just want to be done, and she explained to me that I would need another year of classes (and that's IF all the classes are offered online). I told her for the past year-almost 2- I have been taking classes and if in the end, I can't finish, what's the point?

I think I'm more discouraged than anything because I feel like I take one step forward and fall back two classes.  I just want to have this shit done. It's expensive and I'm running out of ""time"" in sense that I don't have the free time to dedicate to this. Again, I know this is my fault for fuckin around early on, I just don't know what to do going forward.

1246,1708536096.0,Rough Start To Second Semester of College,"
I am a freshman at ASU studying finance. This semester has been a pretty shitty start for me. For starters, I was not looking forward to returning to college. This is because I feel so lonely at college due to not getting invited by friends or having a beautiful girlfriend. Every weekend, I just rot in my dorm. It drives me insane. I also don’t feel like I fit in with others because I’m so socially awkward, boring, and not as street smart as the others. I isolated myself in high school from others because of this and had 0 friends. I feel sick of being this way now ever since end of semester one.

Not only that, but I just feel extra demotivated this semester and struggle with academics too. I was always demotivated to do shit. I had a 3.9 GPA last semester, but I’m already failing two classes this semester. I got my Math 211 Midterm back Friday and I failed it and it dropped my grade from a 75% to a 54%. Im also failing Sociology 101 which is an easy A+ because my dumb ass forgot to do two quizzes. My parents sometimes make me show my grades because they’re paying for my college. Even though they’re not the strictest, they still nag me. I have been yelled at for bad grades in the past though and sometimes threatened to be grounded back in 10th grade and before. The day after I got my math test back, mom made me show my grades and she wasn’t mad, but she nags me to go to TA and professor office hours every week instead of tutoring hours for help. She says to go to them every time it’s available and it’s so fucking annoying. She nagged me to do the same last year when I had a great grade in math until I got annoyed. But now that I’m failing, she’s nagging me again.

When I wanted to start college, I believed that I could get a fresh start from high school and be more motivated to do things like make steps towards fully finding out which career I want and taking steps towards it and learning how to invest and shit. But I’m slacking off on those so much and when Im not at classes, clubs, doing homework, or working out at the gym, I just scroll my phone and computer like the fucking loser I am. Im still the same pathetic, socially awkward, boring loser I was born to be.

To be honest, I have struggled with mental health issues since years ago. But I feel extra hopeless this semester. 

And I try to tell myself to improve time management and learn investing and make more time to read books because I want to rush a frat next semester to force myself out of my comfort zone and learn how to be less socially awkward and have fun. It will be a lot of commitment, especially during pledge semester. But I still waste time like a loser.

Pros:

\- Saving money

\- Get into the work force earlier / internships

\- Cutting time spent in school short, planning on attending grad school anyways (for MBA or law school)

Cons

\- Told by many that college was the best part of their life and for me to purposely shorten that? Possible FOMO?

\- Not graduating same time as my friends

\- Already almost done with first-year of undergrad

1278,1708506854.0,I just failed my first chemistry exam.,"I’m on a burner for obvs reasons. 

So I did really poorly on my first chemistry exam (50%). The class average was a 65%. I usually score decently on my exams (B or higher) so this is not typical of me. An A is an 88% in the class and If I get a 90 on all other midterms and finals, I will have ~86.7% in the class overall, which is an A-, but I do not know how realistic that goal is. I know I can definitely score above an 75 on all my future tests (3 more midterms and a final), but I don’t think I can keep a 90 average. I’m premed so I want my GPA in sciences to be as high as possible. I am going to talk to my professor tmrw and will try to update the post. I am still within the withdraw period where me withdrawing from the class will not show on my actual transcript. I don’t know if its worth risking the possibility of getting a B on my transcript just to try and get an A- at best. Should I just withdraw the course and take general chemistry 1 in community college? I plan on working in a lab in place of the dropped course if I choose that route.

1287,1708489711.0,Should I add mathematics as Major?,"When I entered college, I pursued a major in Engineering Physics, but I soon found myself struggling and disliking the coursework. Several factors contributed to this. Initially, I had desired to major in Mechanical Engineering, but under pressure from my father, I opted for Engineering Physics due to the reputed name of the university I got into it for. This decision created a mental block for me, for instance, every time I thought of a Physics class I was full of negative energy and anger. Additionally, the severe COVID-19 lockdown in my home country meant that my first semester was entirely online, followed by a second semester with strict restrictions on campus(there was also a lockdown during the summer after my freshman year), depriving me of social interaction for nearly two years. Moreover, my high school years were devoid of much socialization, as my focus was solely on academics and extracurricular activities, therefore I was obsessed with meeting people making friends, and living a more balanced life. 

While I maintained a 4.0 in my freshman year, during my sophomore year, I struggled to maintain my study habits, faced a severe mental block in my physics classes, and found myself socializing excessively. I started doing badly in my physics classes(I was a good student in high school so doing badly in classes was new to me), but I did decently in my Math classes. These challenges eventually led to deep anxiety and depression, making it difficult for me to attend classes regularly during my first semester of junior year and I had to withdraw from a class due to too many absences. Eventually, I decided to switch my major from Engineering Physics to Statistics and Econometrics before the second semester of my junior year. Although I am currently in the second semester of my senior year, I have opted to extend my time in college by another semester to complete both majors.

Over the past three semesters, I have worked diligently to overcome my mental health challenges and regain my academic focus. I have also been diagnosed with a mental condition that causes obsessive tendencies, which may have contributed to my struggles earlier on(e.g. obsession with socializing or the mental block against physics). With the help of medication and therapy, I have made significant progress in managing this condition. I now find myself thriving academically, particularly in math and stats-based courses—I even enrolled in a Mathematical Modeling of Biology class and am performing well in and enjoying it. Now even when I look at my old lectures of my physics classes I can understand everything and I;m so interested in it.

Since childhood, I have harbored a passion for pursuing a career in a scientific field and absolutely hate the idea of working a job in finance or software. I also hate the idea of working a boring desk job and I've always wanted to work in research. I want to aspire to pursue a master's degree in the scientific field and maybe a Ph.D. However, I am concerned that my current majors may not align with this goal. I am contemplating the possibility of adding Mathematics as a major, as I only have six courses remaining to complete the requirements. Although this would necessitate staying for an additional semester and possibly taking some classes over the summer, as it could provide me with a more comprehensive academic foundation. I am considering dropping the Econometrics major to focus solely on Mathematics and Statistics. Do you think I should do this?",college

My situation is a little complicated. I am currently a marketing major in an accelerated program, basically just meaning my undergraduate is 3 years and my grad year for my mba is 1 year, for a total of 4 years of school for a bs and an mba. I realized I don't really enjoy marketing, but I do not want to waste the classes I already took as im almost done with my degree, so I was going to double major in marketing and business analytics. However 3 of the classes I would need for analytics would only be offered during fall of 2024. No summer alternatives. This is a problem because I would like to go to Tokyo in the fall of 2024, and the abroad program does not offer those analytics classes. There are also no other semester abroad programs in Japan other than fall 2024. Im currently a sophomore so if I don’t take those classes in the fall, I wont be able to do business analytics since the next fall is my grad year. I was thinking of doing my undergrad in marketing, but my grad year in business analytics as a solution. The issue is if I do my grad year in business analytics, I would have to give up the MBA for a MS in analytics. My parents are against me going abroad because a MBA is more versatile can get a more high paying job, and if I don’t go abroad I’d have a bs in both marketing and analytics, as well as the mba. However I honestly have been wanting to go to Japan for years. Not just a week or two vacation, but to live there, and experience their culture in a way that a well vacation can’t offer, even if its just a few months there. I know the smarter choice is to not go abroad, but honestly I don’t want to miss this opportunity. I’m stuck.

1304,1708480002.0,Students should not have to work while in college full time ,"I don’t know about other countries, but in the US, When you are a college student there is a general expectation that you also have a job outside of school. If you’re attending school part time, or you have an easy course load and want to work part time for extra money that’s all good and fine, but the general expectation for students to work outside of college is insane in my opinion. 

The time demand of a college student who is enrolled in 16-18 units (if they’re going all of the work and aiming for A’s in their classes) is generally equivalent to, or more than a full time job, which is 40 hours per week. The expectation is that you spend 3 hours outside of school studying or doing homework per unit taken. Of course a lot of students either cheat or don’t get an A in the class, but for a student who is studying to the very best of their ability, this is the expectation. So if you’re enrolled in 18 units it would require 54 hours of work outside of class plus the 18 hours that you are in classes that comes out to 72 hours per week. Now I know that’s not realistic to begin with, and most students are not spending that much time on coursework, BUT it’s safe to say that a full time student is busy with school related work at least 40 hours per week. 

The concept of the 40 hour work week was invented so that humans could have time to sleep and take care of themselves, but for some reason as college students we are expected to work jobs in addition to a full time course load. Many students have to work at least part time jobs for money and a lot of them even have to work 40+ hours to make ends meet. Assuming their schoolwork requires 40 hours per week (which is an under estimate) that means an 80 hour work week. I don’t think it should be this way. I think that for students enrolled in college full time, housing, food, and transportation should be subsidized. 

For students who don’t have to work, there is generally a stigma around them being unemployed. I can’t count the amount of times classmates and professors have asked what I do for work and then responded in shock when I told them I don’t work. And they even say “Must be nice” but the reality is it’s just normal and should be this way for everyone. No one acts shocked when a person working full time says they don’t have a whole other full time job, so why is this the expectation for college students? 

I’m busy probably 60 hours per week with schoolwork and classes. I cannot imagine having to work another 40 hours per week on top of that. It would require me to limit my sleep, my exercise, my self care etc to a severely unhealthy point and I have a very weak immune system so I would end up getting really sick. I sleep 7-8 hours a night and I get A’s in all of my classes because school is my full time job and I treat it as such. 

I think that my grades are simply a reflection of my privilege rather than my hard work since I’m competing against students who barely even have time to sleep. Many of my classmates claim to only sleep 3-4 hour nights, struggle to pass their classes, often miss classes and have to ask me for notes, or come to class unprepared and often look exhausted. I have multiple former classmates who have dropped out due to exhaustion and burnout. It’s so fucked up to me that this is just a general expectation for the average college student. 

Oh also not to mention we have to pay tens of thousands of dollars per year to go to college. The system is completely broken. 

Edit: Someone in the comments corrected me. It’s actually 2 hours of work outside of class and one hour of work in class per unit. So a person taking 18 units would be busy 54 hours per week with school related work, not 72. Still with 40 hours of work outside of school that equals 94 hours per week and with 20 hours of work that equals 74 hours per week. ",college

1314,1708476082.0,Grad program forcing us to participate in politics,"Hi, I’m not sure where else to get advice regarding this so here I am. 

I am currently in a grad program who as a profession is trying to pass state and national legislation (I’d rather not say for what exactly for anonymity purposes).

My program has sectioned off a day from our normal schedule and has told us we are required to attend an event at the capital building to advocate for these bills. 

I personally do not support the bill they are attempting to pass along with several of my classmates. They set up meeting times for us to meet with the politician for our zone and advocate for this bill. Faculty have blatantly told up they “strongly” support the bill and go into the meetings with us. A few of my faculty members are actually spearheading the charge to pass this hill so I know voicing my reservations about it will land me in hot water and likely make my life significantly harder for the foreseeable future.

So my question: what can I do about this and is what I’ve described actually allowed at a public university? Honestly I’m terrified of them finding out I am against it due to possible retaliation so any move I make would have to be anonymous.

1326,1708468560.0,The process for getting disability accommodations is a mess,"I'm an incoming graduate student (undecided where, but it's between 3 schools), and lord!!

So, I'm trying *not* to end up in the same sort of situation I dealt with in my undergrad years, but it's hard because every university's process seems to be completely different. 

In undergrad, I attended two colleges - community college and UC Berkeley. At community college, I needed some medical records listing my disability and a signed document from a provider saying I needed XYZ accommodations because of it. I met with a counselor at the disability center, got everything set up, and was good to go in a week or two. 

At Berkeley, I tried to start this process as soon as I could - so, April of the year I transferred. My documentation, come to find out, was no longer sufficient for this school and I needed to get re-evaluated for something I've been diagnosed with for 23 years. Fine, okay. So, I got on a waiting list for about 8 months and paid $1000 out of pocket for the evaluation (because my insurance did not deem it ""necessary"" since I'm already diagnosed). Finally got that documentation, got an appointment with my university's disability office, and got everything set up. The whole process took 10 months and I was without accommodations for my entire first semester and half of my second. I had to drop two classes so I didn't fail them because I *needed* those accommodations. I was on probation after that as punishment for dropping two classes, and that nearly lost me my full-ride scholarship. It was only after my disability counselor advocated for me that I got it back. I very seriously considered leaving Berkeley because of this. They expected me to simply *not be disabled*, and like, it isn't something I can choose.

The same sort of thing seems likely to happen again at one of the universities I'm considering. I'm asking if my documentation would be sufficient *before* I commit to that university so I can make an educated choice, but they can't tell me that before I commit and sign my contract. Their documentation requirements also look a little confusing. It is the most prestigious offer I've received and the most financially appealing. Considering my ability to receive accommodations there *is* the single greatest determining factor for this school, though, I don't want to take the risk that I will be left high and dry, with no accommodations, while I save up for another evaluation and languish on another waiting list. Without accommodations in undergrad those 1.5 semesters, I sacrificed my basic needs like sleep and food for my school work and ended up in the ER because of how hard I was pushing my body. I don't want to do that again, and I shouldn't have to. This university has nominated me for their most prestigious fellowship, meaning they do *really* want me in their department. But if they can't meet my needs, they can't meet my needs. It's just a shame that I may have to reject a fellowship and an amazing school - that would in every other way be an excellent fit - purely because I'm disabled, though. 

The other two options, while not as prestigious, financially lucrative, or great for my particular field, will accept my documentation for sure. I've asked and gotten the answers I need to make me feel confident that the transition to either program would be smooth. There would be no gamble there. But I'd prefer it if my top option could actually accommodate me and if I knew that before making the decision.

I guess what I'm irritated about is, like, why is none of this standardized? Why am I expected to shell out thousands of dollars, spend months or years on waiting lists, tank my education while I wait, and ultimately add tons of unnecessary stress to an already stressful educational undertaking, when I've done exactly that already? Why can't what works for one school work for others? Why do all their systems have to be so different? You would think I was asking for the world here and I'm not. I just want to receive the accommodations I've always received. ",college

I am applying for colleges for the 24-25 school year and I already have a small roster of colleges I'd like to attend. However, in the unfortunate event that I don't get into my dream college ( CU Boulder ), I'd like to have more backups.

The Creative Technology and Design Program at CU Boulder is really what draws me to that college, it combines the logical aspects of mechanical engineering and the emotional aspect of art into a nice little degree. As far as I'm aware this is kind of a ""rare"" degree because I can't find many other collages that accurately represent the ""spirit"" of this degree. ""Our students gain an interdisciplinary education that integrates engineering, computation, creative technology, and design. Following a project-based curriculum, students learn diverse technological skills while pursuing their own unique creative goals.""

One I did find was at Mines (however it's Mines and I'm not banking on making it in), it says on its website ""The Design Engineering program rethinks the way that engineering is taught, learned and practiced. Through coursework focused on real-world design experiences, Design Engineers combine traditional and technical engineering skills with creative problem-solving techniques and design thinking to create innovative solutions to the world’s largest and most complicated problems.""

Beyond these two my options are kinda meh, uninspiring, boring, etc, which is where you guys can help because I sure need it! I like an engineering program that has both mechanical and creative endeavors, with plenty of room for personal pursuits/liberties. I want to make ""left-brained art"".

Beyond that I'm not super picky, I like nature, marching band, riding my mountain bike, relaxed culture, arts communities, etc, I'm a very convincing Coloradan stereotype.

You can be all of those things (lost, lazy, struggling, unmotivated) as long as you get into a trade like hairstylist, plumbing , truck driving, UPS driver or something after you get your degree. But it will also start with getting work experience of some sort. This can be through on campus jobs or jobs off campus like at your nearby warehouse. These places will take you in without a resume (Amazon,Target, FedEx, UPS), hell many of these companies have promotional tracks and programs for college graduates. This is especially for 18 year olds looking for their first-ever job. You don’t want a blank resume under any circumstances. Despite your parents advising you not to work during school.

So I attended community college for my first 2 years, and I am now completed with it. I had planned on moving out of my parents house and into a house with a couple of guys I have known for a long time. Their current house was about 35ish minutes away from campus which i didn't consider to be too bad of a drive (my current cc drive is 30) They however said they're going to look for other houses, and in their area they are looking now, it bumps my drive to about 50 minutes. I had planned on living there with them as it was DIRT cheap rent ($415) and it cut my drive from my parents house about by half. Now because of their move, I feel stuck. I currently don't pay rent or groceries with my parents, which has always been their rule as long as me and my siblings contributed to the house. The commute from my parents house to campus is about 1:10, so I don't personally think it is worth it to have to pay rent and be completely self supportive to save 20 minutes worth of a drive. I guess I am hoping for current/former commuter students to tell me their thoughts/opinions? I am not sure. Like I said I am just feeling very lost. Also, not sure how important this is, but partying and the ""college experience"" is not a big consideration, if at all. The biggest reason for my choice of the school I wanted to go to is price, it is West Chester University which is one of the cheapest in state schools in PA.

I posted here recently about how I feel like I'm at the wrong college in the wrong major, and how I felt like it was too late to change it all. The supportive and encouraging comments I received have given me the push I finally needed to do something for myself for once.

Context: I am a Junior in college, and I have done extremely poorly so far when it comes to academics. I'm majoring in IT, but would like to major in Mechanical Engineering. I would have to switch universities for this, however, because the one I'm enrolled in doesn't have an option for Mechanical Engineering. I am moving in with my girlfriend this August, and the school she goes to offers Mechanical Engineering. 

I'm not sure what the best route for this would be. I feel like I've wasted three years of my life. Should I just create an academic plan with my advisor and finish out the degree I have now? Or should I risk changing my entire career focus?

1358,1708453061.0,How do you know if you're too stupid (or late) to try a new major?,"So, through high school I was never the most science or math focused, but I've also never failed a math or science class. I didn't really *love* science until Junior year Anatomy + Physiology and Senior year Environmental Science. I've had this bug in my brain for a few years now telling me my dream is to study environmental science and become a park ranger.

For some context, I started as a sociology/Spanish major and I *loved* it, but then I switched to Early Childhood Education thinking I was equally passionate about that. Also, sociology is *really* not the most secure career path. Turns out, I am absolutely *not* cut out to be a teacher. On paper I'm back to sociology/Spanish, but there's still time to change that. Over the last semester and a half, I went from *loving* college to absolutely dreading it, and I'm having a hard time working up my old passion for sociology. To make it a career, you need *at least* a Master's and I'm afraid I'm not ready to commit to that. But a conversation with an old sociology professor has put the idea of environmental science back in my head.

My hold ups are

1) I think I'll love environmental science, but I also thought I would *love* education and it made me *miserable*

2) I'd graduate late. I'm just starting a STEM major as a rising Junior. I have a *really* good scholarship, but it only covers 4 years. On the other hand, I have all of Junior/Senior year to plan and save, and it financially makes more sense to do an extra year or two of schooling now than to go back for a full four years down the road.

3) Maybe I'm stupid. That is a genuine possibility. And if I can't keep up with STEM, Junior year seems *really* late to change my major. I feel like I'm running out of time to try new things.",college

For example, in my manufacturing lectures, I get distracted by irrelevant stimuli such as: flickering lights, looking out the window. I try to get back as possible to the lecture when I notice myself zoning out. I try to take detailed notes, but they look messy and unorganized.

The reason I have this mindset is because stereotypically college degrees that are typically viewed as boring like accounting have high paying salaries, low unemployment rates, and low underemployment. (Yes I know there are people out there who love accounting.)

But college degrees considered interesting have a stereotype of low employment, low pay, and high underemployment rates.

(Mind you there are indeed stereotypically degrees out there that pay well.)

This might come off as a childish mindset to some but seriously is the key to success in life to be bored out of your mind in school (it doesn’t help that most college students pay for it and/or go in debt for this) so you can get even more bored in future but have benefits from a job and a not terrible salary?

I’m also in the process of incubating my own startup at college which takes a considerable amount of time. However, I also don’t wanna be the student that tried to run away from an academic challenge.

1389,1708413205.0,"Why does everyone think humanities degrees are ""useless""?","I'm a pure humanities major; think art history, classics, comp lit--that type of stuff. Maybe I'm just naive but I honestly don't understand the ""just read a book and major in something practical"" line people like to use when I tell them my major.

If anything, the humanities have taught me how to be an excellent learner. After reading 500 pages of dense Russian literature a week, I've can easily knock out various how-to books on finance/buisiness in a day. After piecing together logical proofs for a semester, building a sound course of action in a case study interview is childsplay. Since debating postmodern aesthetics in my art history section, I've gotten pretty good at public speaking, advocating for myself, and especially bullshitting.

Long story short, majoring in the humanities was one of the most practical decisions I've ever made. I'll admit, you kinda get what you put into it but if you really apply yourself I don't see why they cant be just as good as any other major. So why the hate? Am I imagining things?",college

For context, I 21 (F) like to think that my mom and I have a pretty good relationship. However, just this past year she seems to have become more and more emotionally dependent on me. I go to college 2 hours away from my hometown, however, I try my hardest to make time for her. I used to visit home every Sunday for family dinner, but lately the two hour drive Sunday night and then the two hour drive back Monday morning are becoming more and more of a hassle as the semester is getting busier. I am taking 18 credit hours and involved in 2 clubs. I have a lot of friends and a boyfriend that I have been with for four months. My mom lately is complaining about how I don’t come home as often as I used to and how we rarely talk. She is upset at the fact that I only call once a day now. I am trying my hardest to be patient with her, but I just wish she would realize that she is smothering me and making me feel like less than an adult. 

This past weekend, I went on a trip with my boyfriend to his parent’s house for his mom’s birthday. I was gone from Friday-today. I talked with my mom Friday morning for maybe 20 minutes, Saturday morning for 15 minutes, I didn’t call Sunday, and then I talked to her this morning already for another 15 minutes. I also texted her throughout the weekend to tell her of my whereabouts. When she called this morning, she was very upset that I barely texted/called the entire time I was there. However, I was just out and about with my boyfriend’s parents. I did not want to seem rude by being on my phone texting. 

Am I just overreacting, or is it a bit much? None of my friends’ parents do this to them. Heck, my friends barely go home, maybe once a month at most. I don’t want to compare, but the guilt tripping is almost getting exhausting now. I am two hours away with a life and priorities of my own. I no longer live full time with her, and I just don’t really want to go home that often. Besides my parents, there isn’t anything else for me up in my hometown. Ugh, adulting is weird.",college

I don't want to make this sound like a plea for attention but here it is. I take a few APs, am in NHS,  hopefully, have an internship lined up for the spring/summer, and I swim competitively almost every day. Firstly, I've watched a few Ivy acceptance videos and have realized that college resumes have to have some sort of theme or specific passion in them, and I don't think I have that. For example, my community service has been pretty sporadic, instead of focussing on 1 or 2 things. And on top of that, I don't participate in activities that all align with an interest such as healthcare for example. Secondly, I don't think my achievements in leadership or academics stand out at all; I haven't won any Science olympiads or led any leadership programs, etc. Is there even a chance for me to make anything happen without it looking like I was scrambling to put things on a resume? 

Side question(sorry), I have taken classes in computer science, and the internship I possibly have for the spring is comp science related, but I've realized that everybody and their moms want to pursue a career in comp science, so I feel like I should pursue something with less competition, and higher chances of success. Would it be wise to focus on something else even if it means making my resume look worse or inconsistent, or should I focus my attention on furthering my comp sci abilities?

The professor for the class is averaging a 1\* rate my professor and is by far the worst one I've ever had in my time here. 

This is supposed to be a 3 hour class and all my friends who took it before (with a different prof) said it was a breeze. Nope. 200 question exams, mandatory off campus recital attendances, weekly papers and 50 question quizzes, mandatory attendance for lectures where he does nothing except speak directly from premade slides, etc. Worst thing is he wrote his own new textbook, put in on a 3rd party site that no other faculty uses, and is charging over $100 just for the ability to take quizzes on the material. 

I'm trying to pay for school, rent, and other classes so I'm working two jobs while in 19 hours.

On the discord, they were asking for quiz answers and giving answers. Taking pictures of the quiz and uploading it to the discord.

1411,1708381045.0,What constitutes academic misconduct and is this worth reporting?,"TL;DR. Good friend has a mental breakdown a few weeks before project is due. Career advisor insists on keeping good friend's name in the project despite non-contribution and tells the group to use friend's individual submission as group submission. The group refused the career advisor's suggestion and removed good friend's name from the project too.

To set context, this was a group project involving 5 individuals (A, B, C, D and me). One of my project mates and close friends, A, had a mental breakdown and was warded into a mental institution a few weeks before the project is due. A has a solid track record in terms of academics and her parents expect her to remain on the dean's list.

Introducing 'E', the career and counselling advisor for A and my group. The family members of A reached out to B to inform them of her mental health condition and express wishes to maintain A's GPA for this semester. The group already has issues with dynamics for this project, with C and D not contributing to the project. Both B and I texted in the group chat, asking C and D to contribute and even allocate ""easier"" portions of the project to them. Zero response from them, but based on both of their Instagram stories, they had the time to be out partying and clubbing. At this point, the project was making decent progress with just the efforts of B and I.

B and I lamented over leaving out A, C and D's names from the project. Ultimately, we decided to cut out A's name first, and decide if we should cut C and D's names out closer to the submission date.

E starts pressuring me first to keep A's name in the project as ""she is still a student of the college"". I refused. While I do sympathize with A's mental health struggles, she did not contribute anything to the group projects. We have modified her workload by leaving her with the easier portions (summary and conclusion) and even visited her house when she told us explicitly she feels better and is ready to do the project with us. I explained that it isn't fair for B and I since we are both trying our hardest to make this project work out. We have already made reasonable concessions taking into account A's declining mental health. E calls me, and I quote, 'cold-hearted b*tch who wants to see her friend fail'. I hung up from conversation.

E realized that she is not going to convince me. She approached B, and starts pressuring her. Unfortunately, B cracks and agrees to put A's name into the document. E also starts infodumping A's personal and mental health issues to B. Subsequently, E accuses me of non-contribution to the project to B despite having zero evidence whatsoever. B gives me a heads up by sending me what E accused me of.

Introducing 'F', the professor teaching the tutorial slot for the project. Prior to my meetup with Professor F, she is already aware of A's mental health issues by E. I explained to Professor F the entire insanity of this situation. She agreed with me, also saying that it is not fair for the team if A does not contribute and we leave her name in the project.

I told B to tell E that we have already sought the advice of Professor F, and she has given us the approval to omit A's name. B informs E.

E tells B that A did contribute, and asked B and I to check our school mail for any documents by A. Both B and I did not receive any emails from A. E insisted that A did contribute, and started pressuring B again to leave A's name in the project. 

It was later revealed that A submitted the project individually.

Professor F got the entire group to meet, and hashed out all discrepancies with contribution with C and D, warning them to be more responsive and contribute or else she will get B and I to omit their names during submission.

After the meeting, I checked in with Professor F about A's individual submission for the group project. Professor F confirmed with us that A submitted the project individually, and reaffirmed her prior advice to allow our group to remove A's name from the project. When I asked if we could see A's submission to compare similarity, Professor F refused, citing potential plagiarism issues for the group if we unintentionally get influenced by A's content. She later helped us compare A's submission and our draft for the project, and reassured us that the content is completely different from the group's.

E sends B a copy of A's submitted assignment. When B asks E how she obtained A's assignment, E said she downloaded it via the submission portal. E then tells B to use A's submitted individual assignment, modify a little, and submit it as a group. B tells me of E's suggestion, and I shut down the idea completely, citing plagiarism and ethics.

It is important to note that E is also a professor. However, she is NOT teaching this particular module for this semester.

I immediately informed Professor F about E's alarming suggestion and sent her the incriminating screenshots. I also informed Professor F about E's baseless accusation about me 'not contributing' to the project. She then tells me to disregard E's instructions and she will deal with E at a later time.

At this point, C and D had contributed to the project albeit to a lesser capacity. I also informed C and D of the situation. We wrote a paragraph as a group informing E that unanimously, we will not pass off A's individual work as group effort. B then sends it to E.

E continues to harass B by infodumping more personal details of A until the semester concluded and demanding B to help A, leaving B unnecessarily distressed.

After submission, I called E with B to set the record straight:

1. I have contributed to the group project in all stages. I was the person who created the document and provided MY PERSONAL essay outline for the project to speed up the writing process.

2. I informed her that she needs to issue a formal written correction for her false accusation as this kind of accusation is taken very serious in an academic settle.

E refused to take accountability for her words, saying that:

1. She added me into a group chat and claimed I did not respond to her texts. Hence, I was ""not contributing""

I told E that if her message was that urgent, she could always drop me a text or email. However, I did not receive a single text or email from her during the alleged week that I was 'added' into the groupchat. B backed up my claim by also helping me visually double confirm that I was not added to any group chats. I checked all of my school communication platforms after the call, there was absolutely ZERO group chats I was added into by E.

2. She refuses to issue any correction because I am 'rude'. For the record, in this call with her, I stuck to only the facts and what she alleged over text. While I might have been firm to get my point across, I'm very sure anyone in my position would have used the same tone to get this very serious message across to an individual who refuses to listen. 

I tried reasoning with her on why a written correction is an appropriate response. My thought process was: ""If E accused me of non-contribution over text, then if proven untrue, it is only fair she issues a correction over text, the same mode of communication E abused to throw baseless accusations relating to my work ethics.""

Of course, that was made by constant interruption from her to the point where B had to forcefully mute E to allow me to finish.

Questions: 
1. Did E commit academic misconduct by pressuring a student (text trail as evidence is available) to take another individual's work and pass it off as group effort?

2. What recourse do I have against E for her (very clearly and reputation damaging) false accusations?

3. Is E even allowed to reveal private information of a vulnerable individual to an unrelated 3rd party (ie. tutorial mates)?

Some considerations:
1. Full-ride, aiming to grad school and above. I am mindful and aware that some educational institutions may try to cover up this incident or even retaliate against me for 'seeking trouble' against a faculty member. This is an even bigger motivation to quash E's baseless claim since it also will impact my scholarship if her accusations reach management level.

2. Any grounds to even pursue action since I feel what E had suggested and done falls in the gray area of what could be defined as academic misconduct.

[EDIT] 3. B is also considering reporting E for emotional harassment, but is afraid of retaliation since E has previously verbally threatened her.",college

This part I suppose is on me but I fully believed I was enrolled in the graduate version of the course for a while.

Ultimately, I did not get graduate credit for the course and would have to take an additional course to complete the master’s degree, probably costing me around $1,000. I’m assuming it’s too late to be compensated for this considering I already completed both classes, it’s just frustrating that the mistake cost me time (completing an extra course for the missed credit) and money (I don’t make a lot). 

It’s a very small Bible college, is there any chance they would help me out? Again, I figure it’s too late but I wanted to be sure before paying the $3,000 I owe.",college
1414,1708376086.0,"For those who enjoy their college experience and would say they have a good, active social life, is that more from classes or clubs or parties or what, essentially if I wanted to live on/near campus and just not be in classes and only attempt to socialize, could it go well?","(This was originally posted on r/OSU so just ignore any specifics on that)

This is probably a different sort of post than is normally on here, and kind of long and vague but if anyone can try and answer that would be appreciated. Basically, I have had pretty severe social anxiety since being in late elementary/early middle school, and I have finally managed to eradicate that and gain significant confidence now at 21. So essentially, the last 10 or so years I have generally been very quiet, I have always had some friends, but ""friend"" has usually been more of a term to describe someone I'm cool with and sometimes talk to at school or work, and less of an actual friend I would regularly message or hang out with. On average throughout middle school, high school, and since graduating in 2020, I have only really had maybe a handful or even just 2 or 3 social sorts of things I have been invited to and gone to each year. Like countless times I've gone to extra curriculars, youth group, various things that I've almost always technically had friends in, but as far as like ""hey were all gonna get together outside of \_\_\_\_ later do you wanna come"" type stuff like rare enough that I typically have avoided getting in conversations where I can expose that I have basically no friends lol. And also have experienced that whole dynamic of like im cool with these 5 guys at this group, yet I talk significantly less than them and ik that they secretly or not so secretly all hang out without me lol. My main socializing since 2020 has been with a gf that I started dating literally right after the covid lockdown my senior year, and only just broke up with in July, and by extension ""friends"" that were just her friends and their boyfriends.

Since breaking up, I have gone through an extreme phase of trying to better myself as much as possible, had a job with forced constant social interaction, have worked out basically everyday, and have gotten finally to a point where I no longer have social anxiety, I can actually just meet new people and have conversations with anyone without feeling scared, yk, like a normal person finally.

So I went to OSU in 2022 to attempt to socialize more already, plus being near my ex that was there. However, I still was pretty insecure, no confidence, social anxiety prevailed in combination with classes and having to work way too much for it to be sustainable. I pretty much ended up doing nothing except fighting with my ex, sitting in my apartment all day being depressed skipping class and work and everything, and dropped out 2nd semester with no friends or fun to show for it and a nice lil chunk of debt that I am finally almost done paying now. Essentially the goal now was/is to return to OSU with my newfound confidence and lack of social anxiety, finish my degree (still need like 2-3 yrs) and basically be ""that guy"" that I always have fantasized ab being and now finally can be, going up to anyone and any event and making friends and flirting and going to parties and actually enjoying college.

So the dilemma is my parents (and me to a lesser degree) really think the better move is to instead take a different career path that I am just as ok with on a base level as what I'm going for at college, but I could just take training for it and start work like now instead of having more years in school, making no money and potentially racking up more debt, all for a real ""college experience"" that they seem to think won't be worth it at all, but I highly disagree, that actually being able to socialize and be myself around lots of people of a similar age and interests for the first time in my life would be the ultimate satisfying thing possible for me right now, and as long as I saved as much as I could and got good grades it wouldn't be a bad path at all.

TLDR;

Again sorry for the length, but I guess the actual question is :

If you enjoy OSU rn and have a good social life, do you feel that being a student is necessary for that? Like if I just wasn't in classes but could go to campus, I just simply wouldn't be able to eat in dining halls, go into gyms, or obviously meet people in classes, however, I am 90% sure that lots of clubs I would be interested in basically do nothing to check if you're actually a student(spikeball, disc golf, billiards, pickup soccer games etc,) plus obviously I could get into all the bars and, if invited, all the parties, plus all the random events they do at the oval, union, all the concerts, sports games, etc. like do i really even need to be a student to get a social life there?? Or is the combination of meeting people in class, then going to dining halls with them, working on school stuff, etc mainly the actual way of getting friends?",college

I am looking into grad programs for my MSW, however I am not sure how I want to approach it quite yet, and was looking for experiences/insight.

1426,1708364125.0,Should I really attend University or just do a coding bootcamp or something similar?,"So here is some context. I (22m) started as a computer science major at a local community college. It was great because I was allowed to try different majors for free as the first two years were free. I ended up getting my AS in business administration and applying to for UC schools.

The problem I have is that I am staring down the barrel of significant debt in student loans to study business economics and I don’t even know what I would do with it when I graduate. It seems practical to instead just do a coding bootcamp for the fraction of the price, just to have the certificate of completion. That will cut into the majority of my savings though, and I will have to start over for university.

The main reason I stopped pursuing computer science is because my mental health was at an all time low when I was studying it, so I wasn’t giving it the proper attention it deserved. However, I have spent the last year or so getting to a strong mental place and I feel like it’s something I’m ready to put the energy it takes to learn.

I am currently in a gap semester and feel like I am wasting time just working. My work experience I am getting has little to no relevance to what I will enter the workforce in, but it’s the best money I can make at my age and with my experience so I feel like leaving would leave me worse off.

Couldn't gel with them partially because I didn't have the money to travel or eat outside.

Because of how much I enjoyed the course, I decided to take that professor again this semester.

One of the motions I recently wrote, which was rather intensive and a test of my skills I felt, was just filed with the court a few days ago and it was something I felt very proud about. Would it be strange or improper to email a copy of that motion to my professor, explaining that it was real-life work product I was able to achieve thanks to their course and thanking her for giving me the opportunity to write motions in her original course? I'm just unsure if it would come across as mooching since I'm still currently their student and the semester is ongoing. At the same time, I feel like waiting months until the semester ends to share the news would be weird too since it would lose its recency. I really do credit her original course for pushing me where I am today and just want to find the right way to express that. Am I just overthinking this?

I graduated from high school in 2021, didn’t have any plans so I decided to just take any major that my dad had suggested and enrolled in uni that same year. My plan was actually to pursue undergrad program in Culinary Management right after I dropped out because it has always been my dream to open up my own cafe bakery. 

I had intended to enroll in 2023, but long story short, the program was under review and they suddenly weren’t accepting new students that year as I had planned. Everything came crashing down. Not to mention a sudden downturn in my family’s finances. Considering how expensive the expenses would be for culinary school, I decided to take another gap year while waiting for my family’s financial situations to improve. That’s how I find myself where I am now. I’ve been working remotely for almost 6 months. Though the pay isn’t bad (enough for me considering I still live under my parents’ roof), this job doesn’t teach me any new skills.

I haven’t been particularly productive during my gap year. Before this job, I briefly worked in the culinary field (kind of), but that’s about it. I had hoped to do some volunteering or internships, but it’s quite challenging to find opportunities in my country. Almost every volunteer positions are only looking for foreigners, and internship opportunities are primarily for uni students. 

I’ve even started yo doubt my choice of major. I’m considering switching to an ICT major (either CompSci or IT), but I’m afraid i’d be too dumb for it and end up giving up halfway through again. 

I’ve been trying to find scholarships to apply for since 2021, but there aren’t many available for culinary students (not as many as for business, IT, or other majors at least). Now with another major in mind, I think I can find more scholarships opportunities. But when I reached out to an agency that helps with scholarship searches, they said that it might be difficult to find scholarships given that I’ll be 22 this year. Honestly bc of this, I’m very close to giving up. My friends are graduating next year, and here I am, clueless about my future. I feel so behind and so lost. 

What productive activities can I do that could enhance my CV? I’m concerned that my CV might not be as strong as other candidates’ when applying for scholarships. Perhaps I could take IT courses / baking workshops / learn a third language. However, some scholarships are already open for applications, and I fear I won’t have enough time to complete my courses before the deadline. :/

I am switching from asynchronous classes as a business major to in person classes for a graphic design AA / transfer agreement!

I was hoping going in person would be a lot better in regards to feedback and actually immersive learning in a open environment with other students! (The feedback on online classes is the only positive feed back I get besides seeing my grades 😂)

But also with how the curriculum is taught. I spent soooo much of my time simply studying alone hours every night for online classes.

1451,1708312875.0,College Advice?,"   So I (19F) have been attending my local community college as a full time student while also working a part-time job for two years now. I plan on majoring in psychology but have recently thought about majoring in buisness as well. 

   My parents are immigrants and never finished their education in their home country. For better or for worse, this has caused me to not understand the American school system. I don't know what is considered a good GPA and I don't have a good grasp as to what is overall expected of me in order to transfer into a Univeristy.

   I realize certain Universities expect different stats, but I often feel discouraged in my education as I dont know what I am doing or if I am even on the right path. More than anything I want to know if this is relatable or if its just an individual problem of mine.

   I burn out easily and feel as though I don't belong. I am worried I am not a good enough student and should take less classes since I often struggle. However I am worried I am going to graduate later and part of me feels ashamed for being so incompetent.

I feel really bad about this because i have spent the last 6 years of my life in undergrad and have not made the best use of this time at all. All i'll have to show for the last 6 years is a degree with a subpar GPA.

I''ll have nothing but a piece of paper after this entire ordeal. I had to be readmitted once and even had to take a semester off. I know no one in my position.

Many have gotten jobs, internships, girlfriends and seem to have matured a lot in different aspecs. I just feel like a failure in this regard. I've not devoted this time to my career but have not had any girlfriends or relationships either. I wasted so much of time on worthless shit.

So i had undiagnosed ADHD and depression which i only recently diagnosed and started taking medication for. But i'm not satisfied using that as an excuse. I see people younger than me in my classes be productive and do things i wish i could have done. (Many are working in labs, projects, Ta's, internships etc). Safe to say i wasn't passionate about science or what i studied in, but it's what i got now. I do want to go for a master's eventually,but my grades are too low. I don't even know what i'd like to pursue as a career. All these feelings and repressed emotions weigh heavily on me and i'm filled with guilt and FOMO. I wasted so many years on useless social media or pursuing non constructive time wasting activites. (Partying, socializing etc.) I never became disciplined and although i've emotionally matured a lot but my skills and knowledge on how to tackle studying or life are  no better than a sophomore's. I was never like this growing up, i was talented and had a lot of potential. People always considered me smart and had high expectations from me. I never pictured myself ending up this way. All my plans got derails, i'm just wasted potential now.

1492,1708265705.0,I have cancer and I'm thinking about going back to school. What should I do?,"  I (23f) was diagnosed with thyroid cancer last spring. It's extremely treatable, but I've felt like garbage and have been glued to the couch for the past year. I've had surgery to remove part of my thyroid and I've been taking medication for several months now, and I'm very happy to say that I'm starting to feel normal again.

  I want to start putting my life back together, and I was actually thinking about going back to school. Where I live, there are not many opportunities for getting work or building a social life, and I feel like getting out of my home town would do me some good. I still have a decent amount of money saved up from before my diagnosis ($40,000) and I'd like to put it towards something I can realistically build a future with. I have an associates in business management that I got while still in high school, but I'm not sure I want to continue to go that route (my parents talked me into getting it). I'm honestly not even sure what I would major in. I'm good at writing, love art, music, animals/nature, and I'm good at learning new languages. I'm a really organized person and a quick learner, and while I tend to be shy, I like working with people. I'm not great with numbers or public speaking.
 Is this even a good idea? I'm so stoked that I'm finally getting my life back and really want to work towards something that isn't dead-end. I'm craving new experiences/opportunities, but I'm still unsure of what direction to go.",college

A bad cough has started to turn into coughing up blood. So this week…I deceased to bite the bullet and finally call out of my classes for the week. My attempts to keep up with them have been mildly successful. However, I’m late on a research paper that was due on Thursday. The bigger issues…are my way of living.

For context, I live on campus BUT don’t have a meal plan. My FAFSA most likely won’t take care of it. Not to mention, my aid is on hold atm because I’m on academic probation. This is because my GPA fell into bad shape due to my poor mental health and few semesters ago. Last semester was much more successful…but not good enough. THIS is probably my last chance to achieve a degree before I hit 30! My parents have already used thousands of dollars for me to return here. So, they can’t help me much more. With that being said, I’m running low on food. The food that my parents gave me before I left survived me for about 3 weeks…I’m now living off grilled cheese, cereal and a bit of vegetables. (I was down 10 pounds in 6 days. Granted, I kinda need it lol) 

On top of this, my car is going to be towed soon. When I drove back on campus, I knew that I needed a permit. The thing is that, when you go on the website, they only sell 9-Monty long permits. Which are meant for the entire school year. Since that I’m only attending the spring period (4.5 months), why spend the entire $450? So, I spent $18 on a 1 month temporary permit, in a lot that’s next to a shady neighborhood, where I can’t monitor it. Now I have to pay $200 in parking violations before they tow me since I’ve been parking in the wrong lot this whole time. With only $62 to my name! Wish someone would finally hire me. 

Lastly, I’m late on a research paper lol. This whole semester only took 3 weeks to come falling down. I’ve been feeling like a failure these past couple of years and I DESPERATELY need some kind of win! I’m just lost when it comes to my options.",college

I’m a first gen college student and I decided to major in biology (bachelor of arts) because I want to be a physician assistant. I debated double majoring in theater because i want to pursue my passion for acting as well but decided to minor in it instead since I already have a lot of experience in theater and would like to graduate early if possible. I’ve recently been browsing through jobs I can get with a biology degree in case my PA plans don’t work out for any reason and I’m completely stumped. Don’t get me wrong, I love biology, I love the labs I do in my classes and I find the subject to be fun to pursue as a hobby but I simply don’t see myself being a biologist for the rest of my life, I’ve started to see that biology majors aren’t payed well unless they get a masters or go into the medical field so I went into a bit of a career crisis when I realized this major wouldn’t do me much unless I was guaranteed to go to PA school. I want a major that I can use as a cushion that will not pinpoint me into one field and leave me with several regrets. I looked at switching my major to theater while still fulfilling my PA school requirements but there’s also not many great jobs for me to fall back on either unless I really make it big in the acting industry. I’m thinking of switching to a communications major while still minoring in theater and completing my PA school requirements. This would mean giving up my summer in between transferring that I was hoping to use to work full time as a medical assistant to earn pce hours to instead catch up on classes so I can still graduate on time (this plan would leave me with about 90 credits). But I’m not sure if I should just finish my biology degree since I have around 30 credits left to finish it and just double minor in communications and theater (this would leave me with around 80 credits) or just stick with my original plan of finishing my biology degree and minoring in theater (i would have about 60 credits left and I would graduate a quarter or semester early). Plus I heard that majoring in something that’s not stem based will actually make me stand out a bit more to PA programs. I’m truly torn on what to do, of course I want to be a PA really bad but I also want to have a more broad major that’ll point me into several directions just incase.

From the very first day of my major, I've experienced harassment from both my peers and professors. This is mainly due to being one of the few females in a predominantly male program and not having an terrible appearance. I've endured this for about a year now and really don't want to change my major, but the bullying is becoming unbearable.

The nearest school that offers this major is a two-hour drive away. Would you prefer commuting two hours each way, totaling four hours, for one semester, five days per week, or endure constant harassment from your male peers? The commute would be five days per week for the first semester, then reduced to twice per week for the following two years.

Our classes are entirely social and group work-based, and are five hours long. So, unlike a regular college class where you can potentially ignore your peers if necessary, these classes require socialization.

im 2nd year in a CS degree,not going to say im the smartest but also not the dumbest person,maybe above average.

here's some background: i've been financially struggling for the past 3-4 years.  
took a loan for a car,paying rent,credit cards,dental problems,insurance..etc.

started my degree last year,and got a small loan for the year(because my balance was below zeros)  
so last year i had to pay rent,loans the regular stuff plus the yearly college tuition,so my only choise was to work full time 7 days a week whilst trying to do a CS degree(which is a very hard task atleast for me)

this stress and overload on myself caused my girlfriend to end things with me because i didn't have time and will(and the money) to do anything.  
even though i managed financially somehow(earned around the same amount  that i pay every month)i wasn't really studying anything,i was going to lectures and trying to understand and focus but never really doing anything at home or the extra stuff you need to do to actually study,when the exam period started, i failed 4/5 courses on my first semester(plus the gf break up)  
on my 2nd semester i thought i was doing better failed 2/6 courses(perhaps i got lucky)

its my 2nd year,first semester of the year,and i probabbly failed already at 3 exams and i dont know about the next two.  
it feels really impossible for me to actually pass all of my exams and graduate this way.

i dont feel like i'm stupid or anything,but you cant ""sleep"" for the entire semester and then study 4-5 days for an exam and expect to pass.

if im trying to loosen up on the work hours and focus more on the studies and fail the exam anyway then it was a waste of time and money(because i'll be sinking more in debt) but if i work normally and fail the exams as well it will feel even worse(because maybe i did work a few less hours i could pull this off)  


so i'm wondering if anyone was in the same situation as me, or does anyone have any thoughtful advice on how to approach this situation,because even if i survive somehow this year,and by magic somehow i even manage to gradute,i dont really know how to even code properly,so i dont know how will i even manage to acquire a normal job,Thanks.

Before I transferred to my university, I went to community college. I took a one unit course that lasted four hours that was for freshmen. I was sexually harassed all four hours by a professor I never saw again. He touched my back, arm, and hand. He would constantly look at my chest. He humiliated me in front of other students Was extremely aggressive and wouldn’t accept no as an answer over the smallest of things. At the end of the course he grabbed my hand and said “I’m so glad to have met you”. I still remember feeling defeated and hurt. I cried all the way home. I ended up talking to the Dean and I ended up getting really emotional just talking about it which made him doubt my story. He looked him up on rate my professor and said “well nobody else complained about this happening except you” I ended up dropping the idea of filing a complaint against this professor. I knew it would only make it worse. I went through my college years without ever seeing him again but I often wonder if he is out doing this to other girls.",college

1535,1708184508.0,How should I handle this midterm experience?,"I am a fourth year senior with a high GPA who is already familiar with this math heavy midterm material, having taken the first half of this course before withdrawing for reasons unrelated to education. Before this late-in-the-day midterm, I spent the day prior and the day of studying the material. I was very familiar with it. The previous lecture the professor gave a review which covered the test material, and told us to get to the test 10 minutes early.

I arrived to the test 20 minutes early. The professor wasn't there, but the class of 50 twenty year olds was, and they were extremely loud and rambunctious, to the point that they maxed out my anxiety/stress. The professor came in five minutes before the test was to begin, ignoring the cacophony while I sat in silent patience waiting for the test to begin. He and his assistant passed out the tests five minutes before the test was to begin and told everyone ""Don't look at the test, or whatever. It's ughh an academic violation."" I watched as a fourth of the class started blatantly going through the test, the professor just ignoring them. I didn't look at the test and just sat there confused and stressing out, wondering if I should be getting a head start like everyone else, or if he was soon to notice someone and instantly fail them. 

He announced the official beginning of the test. I am now in peak stress from the constant noise and extreme unprofessionalism. I open the first page, to the very easiest of questions, and my mind is a complete blank mess, every nerve in my body lights to absolute max as a I realize I am too stressed to function at high math in this state.

The professor leaves the room, letting everyone know that he is administering another testing room at the same time elsewhere, and his assistant will be crossing off times on the board for a form a countdown. I proceed to get something of a grip after struggling for 5 or 10 minutes and start approaching the exam in a more forced methodical method, stress still extremely high. I keep an eye on the remaining marks on the board indicating the last 5 minutes of the exam. When I look up to observe there are two marks left on the board, the proctor notices, walks over to the person sitting next to me, asks to look at their watch, then proceeds to mark off both remaining marks at the same time. He announces that ""the test is over"". Then proceeds to say ""you can look at the test for five more minutes"". 

I am uninterested at looking at a ""test that is over"" and turn it in, as is, while I observe my students continue to work on the test. I leave the room.

The test results are back in less than 24 hours and I have a failing grade. This exam was worth 30% of my final grade. 

To summarize, I am sure I would have done well on this test had a proper testing audio environment been maintained, had I made use of the ""extra 5 minutes"" of pretest evaluation others took and the professor allowed, and had the proctor kept track of the time properly as I had planned on using the last remaining 5 minutes to look over my test and reevaluate things. I am sure I would have corrected several significant issues.

I have never experienced anything like this before. What would you do in this situation? 

To be clear, I am asking if I should approach the professor, or the department head, or the dean? I am in emotional disarray, and don't trust the professor to provide a professional final testing environment. Am I just going to come off as a student complaining about a low test score?",college
1536,1708184092.0,Question to those studying English literature,"Hi! I'm majoring in English Studies (or rather, the equivalent of it in my country), and until now, we had been studying short stories and novels. However, for the past semester we started studying poetry (English Romanticism). 

Poetry is fine, I like reading poems here and there, but when it comes to close readings, analysis and essays on poems... I honestly can't be bothered.

Literature isn't the ""main"" part of my degree. It's actually divided in three: literature, history and linguistics (and it's safe to say I'm much more interested in the two latter ones).

I'm currently in my first year studying Business Administration @ RSM. Just to provide some context, I'm Dutch and spent a year at TU Delft studying Energy Systems Engineering before transitioning to BA due to founding my own startup (I was not always able to show up to mandatory classes).

Reflecting on my experience thus far, I've found BA to be relatively straightforward. I've attended around four lectures this year, yet managed to pass all my classes on the first attempt with an average grade of 8/10. I feel that the program hasn't challenged me enough, that's why I consider accelerating my program (doing the last two years at the same time) so I can pursue a more demanding master's degree in Biobased Engineering (WUR). I don't want to do an honours programme, because they are always about entrepreneurship and I am already doing that in practice. 

I'm curious if any of you have faced a similar situation or have insights to share. Would you recommend doing this if the curriculum feels too easy? Or will the last two years be a lot harder?

I will also consult with the study advisors, but I value hearing firsthand experiences from fellow students as well.

As the title says, I’m not allowed to pursue the major I want. Originally, I wanted to do something related to biology, but the scholarship I’m in (from Luwait) doesn’t allow that since I didn’t take at least three sciences in high school. I tried to convince them by saying that the university allowed it since they gave me an acceptance letter for bachelor of science, but they still forced me to major in something non-scientific. So I just ended up choosing economics since I thought that would be the safest option to take.

However, I discovered that while my major has to be non-scientific, I can major minor in anything I want. I was planning to minor in something like Microbiology while still doing my major in Economics. 

I guess my question is whether this may be a good idea to do or not. Is it possible for someone to do a master's in microbiology after doing a minor in Microbiology? Or should I just give up on this entirely and just minor in something that’s more aligned with my major?

1546,1708157416.0,Asking for advice: Astronomy or Electrical Engineering?,"Hi this is my first ever reddit post (excuse me if it's not well written, english isn't my native language) or if i broke any of the rules.

I would like to ask for some college advice, well more more specifically career advice.

The situation is the following.
I'm from Chile and here (at least in my Uni, ""The University of Chile"" more especially the ""Faculty of Physical and Mathematical Sciences"") if you want to study a STEM career (Maths, Engineerings, Physics, etc) you have to go through something called ""Plan Común"" (A core program), here you learn the basics of Algebra, Calculus, Programming and Physics during two years (four semesters) at the end of it people go to their respective careers, and here comes my dilemma, i just finished the core program last year, and i am between to choices, I'll go for each in the two following paragraphs:

Option A: Electrical engineering, i failed my eletromsgnetism course last year (in the last semester) due to not managing my times correctly, (i took 3 extra courses, one of the was a robotics class which i loved) I took the course again this summer and i passed with good grades and felt in love when i finally understood the contents.The thing is if i am going for this option i would have very good empleabilty rates and a very good salary but studing this enginieering would take 4 years

Option B: Astronomy: I have love this since i was a little kid, i remember seeing cosmos (Neil's) with my dad in Nat Geo as one of my fondest memories, and in high school i to study this because the following reasons i was (and still considere myself) good at math and physics, my family is very oriented to computer sciences (both my dad and brothee are programmers) so i grew up surrounded by PCs and i program pretty well, and the last one, i feel very passionate about it. But here is the last part of the dilemma, it takes 2 years to study and i get a ""Licenciatura en ciencias con mención en Astronomía"" (A Bachelor of Science in Astronomy) so even if it takes less time it wouldn't actually matter since i would still have to go for postdoc studies to basically be a good scientist.

i almost forgot, here you can study freely (no cost) if you are poor enough and had good grades during high school (for getting in a good Uni) and while you are in college. So basically money is a problem if i fail a certain quantity of courses.

What should i go for? Something more stable or a dream?",college

How do I become a better student and person?,"**TLDR: Freshman in college whose life-long lack of ambition and direction led me to drop out of my 4 year cali state school after first sem for community college, with the goal of transferring into a UC (specifically Berkeley or LA). However my mental health is crippling me and hindering my academic abilities. I'm scared it might be too late to and that I will always be stuck behind and lacking. That fear and the effects of it are pushing me towards my end** 

I never wanted or expected to live through anything in my life. Not during middle school, and definitely not in high school, but now that I have, I'm struggling to even stay alive. I was never good in school. I knew I should've placed more emphasis on it, but I could never seem to focus or retain information. I also was never taught how to study or take notes, or do things that seemed to come so naturally to everyone else. It was so discouraging that it never left me. In addition to that, the pandemic which hit during the last half of my freshman year of HS made me so chronically online and used to rotting every day that it stayed that way. I know I sound pathetic admitting that, but its true. My new bad habits, added onto my already lackluster efforts in school and preexisting mental health issues, crippled me. I only did enough to get average passing grades, even cheating a few times when needed. My small, underfunded out of state military school made me feel very underprepared academically and lacked a lot of opportunities and resources other students may have had at theirs. Or maybe I'm just trying to cope and it really is all just my fault. I don't remember any math or science from HS, which is a huge part of my anxiety because I fear I won't be able to be successful at a top school or get a good job after college without being good at those skills. I've never had any consistent hobbies or extracurriculars because for some reason I would always get bored and have never enjoyed them. Finished my first semester at my CSU with only a 3.32 and gave up my dreams of being a nurse/doctor because I feel too dumb, changed my field of study 4x and still don't know what I want to be or what I CAN be after college (though I've settled on studying philosophy and psychology). I feel so unable and lost. A failure, and like a shell of a person because I've let my bad habits and bad mental state make me so unaccomplished. I don't know what to do or why my feelings are consuming me entirely. My anxiety is so bad I'm too scared to even open my laptop and look at course content or do homework.

and i'm a massively awkward incurable introvert so i really have no clue how to ""network"" with my professors and figure out what kind of stuff they're working on in the interest of asking to get involved myself. for instance one of my professors regularly visits archaeological digs. another is in the research phase of writing a book. i don't know if those are their primary academic projects with the university that undergrads could even get involved in or what.

i just WANT TO DO COOL STUFF AND I WANT TO DO FUN RESEARCH AND LEARN THINGS AND WRITE AWESOME PAPERS god help me

1557,1708140230.0,Seeking Advice: Withhold of Adjudication on Drug-related Felonies and FAFSA's Pell Grant Eligibility,"Hello Reddit community,

I find myself in a bit of a dilemma and could use some guidance on a legal matter. I have recently been offered a withhold of adjudication on several drug-related felonies. My primary concern is how this might impact my eligibility for FAFSA's Pell Grant.

I'm currently debating whether to take this case to trial, as there's a slim chance it might still allow me to pursue a military career. On the other hand, if a withhold of adjudication enables me to attend college, it might be a more practical decision, considering my financial situation.

Has anyone here faced a similar situation or has knowledge about how a withhold of adjudication on drug-related felonies may affect FAFSA eligibility? I'm particularly interested in understanding if it would hinder my chances of receiving the Pell Grant, as I am struggling financially and attending college is one of my few viable options.

Hi everyone! I'm 26 and still have another year left before I finish my degree. I started right out of high school because of parental pressure (they told me I had to go, but refused to pay for it and I had no boundaries so I did) and failed most classes because I had no clue what I was doing or how to study, then took a two year break, then got my associates, then had a major injury while trying to force myself to thrive in a major that was horribly run and bad for my mental health for a year & a half, then took off almost two years, and now have been back in school for almost the past year again. It's an online degree, and I'm doing something I'm actually good at now.

The problem is I'M SO TIRED. I'm tired of not having my degree and worrying that I'll still only get these low paying jobs even after I get it. I'm tired of being in school and working full time. I'm tired of homework. I feel really mentally drained to the point that I'm doing the bare minimum of homework and dread doing it.

I'm (23F) final year university student currently busy with my postgrad studies.

They have been divorced for over 15 years and neither of them has moved on or enjoys going out much despite them not liking being alone. I'm particularly worried about my dad.

1576,1708117028.0,Parents who pay their child’s college: will you not pay for certain majors?,"I had this discussion with one of my friends who went to college for film and I want to know your opinions.

Years ago when I headed off to college, my parents told me they were going to be paying my college tuition (lucky me!). 

However, they wouldn’t just pay for any major. They gave me a list of majors they would pay for, and a list of majors they would not pay for. Notice the wording there: if I want to go to college for something else, I’m free to do so. They just won’t pay for it.



The list of majors they would pay for included but not limited to:

Electrical engineering

Computer engineering 

Mechanical engineering 

Civil engineering 

Chemical engineering 

Computer science

Nursing

Economics

Finance

Accounting

Biology

Business administration 

Information technology.

To summarize, it was almost any college major that was a bachelors in science or something business related.

On the other hand, these are majors they would not pay for:

History

Film

Anthropology

Political science 

Anything else with “art” in the title.

Their reasoning? They went to the bureau of labor statistics and looked up the average student loan debt for each major. Then they looked up how long it would take to pay off my student loans given a certain college major. Every major that would take less than 5 years to pay off with an entry-level salary in that field they would pay for. Everything they wouldn’t pay for would take more than 5 years to pay off.


Luckily this wasn’t a problem for me at all. I had already decided as early as middle school I wanted to be an electrical engineer. My sister ended up choosing biology. 


Meanwhile two friends from college went to school for film. After graduation One of them works at a consignment store and the other drives patients around at a local hospital. I have moved out of my parents house and now live independently. My friends who went to college for a liberal arts major can’t afford to do so. 

There are good arguments for why you should pay for your child’s college regardless of their major. Such as you will never get the “college experience” again in your life. But I don’t know if I buy this because my college experience consisted of playing video games and going to Walmart with my friends (rural college). I could do that as an adult.


On the other hand there are very good arguments to this approach my parents used, and the proof is in the real world: I moved out of my parents house and pay all my own bills. My friends cannot afford to do so. The purpose of going to college is to make more money. College is too expensive of an investment to simply go for the purpose of partying for four years and learning for the sake of learning.


But what do you think? Would you pay to send your kid to college even though you knew they couldn’t afford to leave after they graduated? Or would you be like my parents and only pay for degrees that ensure you could afford to live independently? This isn’t something I have to think about immediately, but it does apply in the future if I choose to start a family.",college

1581,1708110516.0,"22, turbulent, and environmentally inclined","I (F22) have been floundering academically ever since I graduated high school. I'll try to summarize. 

I took dual enrollment and AP courses during school, a great opportunity and privilege, but rather than labbing with different subjects to figure out what could get me a job (let alone ignite some mf'ing PASSION into me), it left me feeling like credits are a grind to get through rather than interact with. I graduated high school, and immediately went to undergrad for a year, remaining undeclared. I was miserable. Not knowing my purpose prevented any confidence, and I did not feel like I could academically discover myself after classes went online. I then took a gap during the peak 1.5-2 years of covid, where I volunteered at animal shelters and worked minimum wage to survive, seeing friends and family rarely. I wrote a ton, and read only enough. I went camping by myself throughout each season. I was hoping to explore life more as a 19-year-old, but covid prevented my few ideas. I lived alone, losing so much of my sociability and motivation. After awhile, realizing that repetitive labor gave me room to understand I'm not utilizing my brain in the way it needs to be (nor was I even considering a future, being so depressed), I decided to return to college once it remained offline. 

With all of the identity disturbances and social science credits completed in high school, I returned to a different school (one of the big 10, for context) studying biopsychology (AHHH). My constant turmoil between ""picking something with job prospects"" and ""picking something that's interesting"" has caused me to remain stuck in a pile of glue, somehow landing on a major that provides neither. 

What’s wacky is that I’m basically done with my degree, however I’m realizing that earth/environmental science/ecology/wildlife is where my innate curiosities have always been. I know that an environmental science degree won’t grant me immediate employment, either, and that adding on another year or two will not be a financially sound move (and I already haven’t been financially literate by starting college before I knew what for). I’m too flippant in my interests and am fearful of making a costly mistake, but this has paralyzed me on my gap and I don’t want to remain stagnant forever.

To further flirt with my fleeting enthusiasm, for the past few months I’ve been volunteering at the local science center where I handle the reptile and raptor exhibits. It’s the highlight of my week. I became president of the entomology club at my school as well, but I know neither of these are laboratory experiences that show my understanding of the fundamentals of core science. To graduate next year, I only need a couple more psychology classes, so I have room in my schedule for some evolutionary biology or geology courses. I haven’t quite limited what I want to do in the environment or with creatures, which I know is an issue regardless of if I have the degree or not. I’ve been accepted into some geological research camps that offer quite a bit of course credit, but will also cost a couple pennies to do.

All I ask for is some input. Do I reach out to labs in hopes to gain some experience before I graduate in 2025? Do I add a double major, and spend another few thousand towards university? What classes should I add to my schedule next year as masters prerequisites? What do I do to get into the environmental scene after college if I have an irrelevant degree?

TLDR: I returned to college after a gap year to study Psychology but do not want a counseling or social work career, and am realizing I have a passion for environmental science/ecology/evolutionary biology.

However, after growing up a little a not being a naive teenager anymore, I'm beginning to realize that that is really not what I want to do in life. I took an intro CS class and really enjoyed it-- enough that I've just been filled with regret over my choices and am unsure what to do-- especially considering getting employment with just a humanities degree is pretty difficult.

1588,1708098192.0,Will getting another W prevent me from being admitted to grad school?,"Hi all! I’m (27F) a nontraditional student who just started school again last semester to finish my biology degree. For the most part, it’s been going very well. I have a 3.79 GPA and I’m working part-time in a lab I enjoy. I got all A’s last semester and have A’s in most of my classes this semester. The problem is with chemistry.

At my college, there’s a chemistry class that counts towards the biology major, and then a basic chemistry course below that one that doesn’t count. You can take the basic chem course if you didn’t take chemistry in high school/didn’t test into the major-level chemistry. When I was in college the first time, I tested into the major-level chem course, so I that’s the one I signed up for this semester.

I thought I’d be okay in this course but I was wrong. It’s been a decade since I took chemistry in high school, and I’ve found that I don’t remember nearly as much as I thought. I feel lost all the time. I’ve gone to office hours and that’s helped a bit, but despite that, the knowledge gap is huge. I studied a ton for the first exam and still failed it. I can try, but I'm not confident that I can catch up fast enough in chemistry to save my grade at this point. I'm very embarrassed that I put myself in this situation.

I met with my advisor and he recommended that I drop the major-level chemistry, take a self-paced refresher course for the rest of the semester, and then take it with a higher-rated professor over the summer. (Taking the basic chem course next fall isn't an option since it'd delay my graduation by a year.)

I’m strongly considering going with what my advisor recommended and think I’d do well with this option, but I’m concerned about adding another W on my transcript. I’m hoping to go to grad school after I graduate, and I don’t want this W to potentially hurt my chances at being admitted since I have quite a few Ws already. Back when I was originally in college, I was dealing with some serious traumatic events that impacted my ability to focus on school. I had a scholarship that I would have lost if I dropped out, and my family told me I’d never go back if I left, so I continued on despite everything. This didn’t work out so well, and as a result, I have a few semester’s worth of W’s. Looking back, I really wish I would have taken a pause in my education much earlier, but I realize that I can’t change the past and can only move forward.

My question is: do you think it’d be wise to take the W at this point, and would it hurt my chances at being admitted to grad school?

Thanks so much for your help!",college

1604,1708058871.0,My college professor lowered my grade when I asked for help.,"I am taking an online government class. Should be easy, but I was wrong. My professor is a very tough grader on written assignments. 

I recently received an 86% on an assignment. When I reviewed the rubric and her feedback, they did not match. Her feedback was stating that I did great and fully understand the subject but used too many direct quotes. But the rubric scores did not reflect that. 

So I emailed her requesting a meeting to DISCUSS. She regraded my assignment and gave me an 81% before we discussed the assignment. It is important to note I DID NOT ask for a regrade. 

I had informed her that it is a goal of mine to receive an A in her course, so I wanted to know where to improve upon.  I did not ask her to regrade the assignment at all. 

I confronted her about the regrade and she said that an “81 was the original grade. That was the grade you earned.” But I have the canvas email stating that the assignment was regraded after I brought up the meeting.

Anyways. I don’t really know how to move forward with this. On one hand she is the professor and I think she can alter the grades as she pleases. On the other hand I feel like there is going to be a bias moving forward through her class and I won’t be able to receive anything higher than a B. I don’t want to make this a big fuss if it’s just a professor on a power trip, but I need an A in this course. 

Any advice on this? TYIA

*****UPDATE: *******
My professor and I met and it went well! She explained why I received the grade that I did and she apologized for not informing me of the grade change. She said it was a mistake and that I did receive the 81 and that it was not a mark down out of spite. We went through my assignment and discussed improvements and how I can succeed in her course. I apologized for “grade grubbing” and informed her that it was never my intention to tell her what to give me. I was trying to show that I was motivated to improve. She said she understood and she apologized because of the miscommunication. So we are back on the right foot! Thank you for everyone’s positive feedback! I was able to apply it during the meeting! :)

I came to this dorm specifically for it's gender inclusivity, (or supposed gender inclusivity according to the housing office). I'm still in a very odd phase of my transition,  and it makes me uncomfortable sharing a space with a cishet couple. Don't get me wrong, they're pretty nice and all, but the ancient heater system in our dorm has a lot of gaps and holes that take a lot of privacy away between our rooms.

Is it just an overreaction on my part? I don't want to be an asshole, but she's over here every single night, and I feel like it's unfair that she gets to stay here every night while me and her boyfriend are the ones paying for the suite. I wouldn't have a problem if it was a few times a week, but every night is too much. I should have done a room change when I had the chance, but I was worried about ending up with even worse roommates.

I know I'm FAR from a great roommate myself, but how do I handle this conversation? I feel like it would be beneficial for me and my roommate to air out grievances, but we're both quite introverted and awkward.

1625,1708029693.0,Any resources for going back to college?,"Hey, I don't know if this is the right place to ask, but does anyone have any resources they'd recommend for refreshing myself for college? 

So, for context, I started college right after highschool, and I dropped out after a year. Just the wrong time, wrong major, had some personal issues, etc. So, I failed a few classes, and dropped out. I've since started working, saving some money, and realized that I probably want to go back within a few years. One of my problems, though, is that I have definitely forgotten A LOT from the classes I did actually pass. I was just wondering if anyone knew of food resources for catching myself by up, or even getting ahead on some subjects I think would helpful. I'd also appreciate anyone's advice or experience regarding actually getting back into college after failing a few classes. I'm probably not doing anything soon, but would like to make things easier on myself while I have time.

1626,1708029462.0,I don't know if I should switch majors (again) or not,"Basically, I'm 23 and still in college. To show for it, I have two associates that I didn't try to get but somehow did. I've changed my major 4 times I think? Paralegal -> CrimJ-> Cardiac sonography --> Nuclear medicine. I had a reason for changing all of them. But this time it isn't so easy.

I've really struggled with school, I won't even lie that I'm not an A student. I really love Nuclear med (bachelors), it fascinates me, it'll pay well, and it almost guarantees a job after graduation. But to graduate, I'll basically be killing myself for the next two years with no room for failure, breaks, or a life. And then there's a chance I'll graduate AFTER I turn 26 so I won't have healthcare for a time, and I really need healthcare.

Or I could change my major to Psychology. It's a completely new route for me, sorta. my ""accidental"" associates is in social sciences because I took so many psych classes and enjoyed them and did well in them. I would be able to graduate next spring with a much lighter work load, I could have breaks and a life and not burn myself out. So I'd have a bachelors well before my 26th birthday. But it wouldn't guarantee a job and it doesn't pay nearly as well. Don't get me wrong, I love psychology, but I had never considered it as a career, idek what I could do with that degree.

I know ultimately I make this decision, but what would you guys do? Any psych majors here that can tell me what it's like? any nuc med majors that can tell me if it's worth absolutely burning out over?",college

Here are some more questions I have:

**1.**) I haven't taken a programming class at my community college will this be an issue?

**2**.) How much code would I have to learn? (I've been told to start off with Python and then move to Java. However, what would be the best way to learn from scratch)

**3.**) Would it be an issue if I applied to the CIS/MIS major in my future 4-year instead of going into a Business Specific Major such as Business management? 

**4.**)Would they reject me because I haven't taken CIS/MIS classes?

**5.)** Would it be better to apply as a Business Specific Major and then switch over to CIS/MIS?

1637,1708019796.0,Our college is broken.... What would you do? (feeling defeated) :(,"Sometimes when I hear, ""college is a waste these days"" I feel like they are directly talking about our school. I am frustrated and need advice from you wonderful redditors.

I am going to be slightly vague with some details because let's be real.....we have $60,000 wrapped up into this school with a few months until graduation. Don't want to ruffle the feathers too hard until the diplomas are in hand. Here's the story....

My fiancé and I moved out of state so she could attend a medical program at what seemed like a great community college. I am able to work from anywhere and were looking for a new adventure hence why we did this journey. The college ,like most I would assume, sold us on the low cost of the program, excellent staff, blah blah blah. Almost two years into this and we are both so frustrated. My fiancé and many other students are thousands over what the original estimated costs would be. We are more concerned though it would seem as we have been paying most of the costs out of our own pockets. Most of the classmates are younger and have their parents simply footing the bill. If the parents knew what they were actually paying for, I think they would be livid. Since the program has started, students have been required to purchase their own medical instruments which will most likely be never used again as the future employers provide them. The cost of the instruments ended up being over 2,000 dollars from the original quote. Professors basically shrugged and said, ""sorry....inflation🤷🏻‍♂️"". Then on top of the ""class fees"" which were not broken down, were charged new software fees, are forced to ""volunteer"" to raise money for the program, had to buy testing software from a specific company even though there was free open sourced software readily available (im assuming professors are getting a kickback, and for the cherry on top, the program is charging a ""site fee"" to take the upcoming boards of $200 per students and yet the site is RIGHT HERE AT THE SCHOOL. It's OUR school. Most of these costs have been piled on during the second year of the program so there's not really any backing out. The entire class wrote a professional letter to the program director stating cost concerns and she basically replied with ""sorry, the document you signed said school costs were only an estimate. If you do not like it, you can leave."" She is the same director that claims she searches for grants all day to find funding for the program. A program that just had a brand new multi-million dollar building built that it seems we are all footing the bill for.

So with that said, what do we do? I feel the program needs to be audited but by who? I feel that I can not take it directly to the school is the employee moral here is dirt. Theirs is no accountability, no happiness amongst them, and I imagine if I bring concerns like this to them or a board meeting, I will be met with issues. We definitely do not want to risk everything that my fiancé has worked for.

I have reached out to the states department of education who referred me to the states community college board. Have called the board multiple times with never a call back:(

If a student chooses to take a chance and raise their hand in response to your question, do not **ever** make them feel regret for having done so. Time and again I have seen teachers shut students down in a disrespectful manner, then complain that people don’t raise hands enough during class discussions. 

The best lecturers I’ve had will **always** compliment and thank students for active participation. Many people will never again raise their hands after being embarrassed, and their peers will avoid trying altogether out of fear of receiving the same treatment.

1644,1708012410.0,8am classes are actually eating me alive.,"So I’m a freshman in college and I, unfortunately, have to take a math class that is required as like the bare minimum math credit. Mathematics is not my strong suit whatsoever, so im just trying to pass the class while still maintaining my A. Thankfully, the class is super easy. My school sucks, though. It sucks so bad that it’s closing because it’s 4mil in debt and being bought by a larger university. I’ll be here for the year then be forced to transfer (yay). Aside from that, the food windows, especially for breakfast are so ass and the caf is so gross (has rats and all types of bugs), that it’s hard to eat breakfast and feels like I have to allocate my time to them instead of it being allocated towards me DESPITE paying thousands for an education. 

Anyway, the math class is 8am. I had another math class in the first semester that was 8am but this time, for some reason, 2nd semester classes in general have been kicking my ass a bit and this 8am isn’t helping. For the life of me, I can’t seem to wake myself up, despite setting many alarms and putting my phone way across the room from me. If I do the latter, I’ll think I have some time to get some extra sleep in and then I end up missing the class entirely. 

I know, in a way, it’s my sleep schedule dle as I stay up till like 4am but I somehow always wake up at 9-10, still tired, but awake enough to function which sucks bc class ends, but good, because it’s not entirely late. It’s like this school expects you to have a full wake up at 6am and go to sleep at 10pm. 

Thankfully, my math teacher is really chill so she doesn’t mind lateness, but I’m not late, I’m just straight up missing class. 2nd semester just started and I feel like I’m doing so poorly. This week was the first I missed both classes (have one Tuesday and Thursday). Yes, the obvious answer is get more sleep, and sleep early, I know, but every Monday, Wednesday, and Sunday, I have rehearsal for a show I’m in from 6-10pm and I get home around 11-11:30 and my classes on Thursday and Tuesday don’t end until 3pm so sometimes I study for like 1-3 hours before rehearsal or until I’m finished whatever I need to do, then have my free time. I can’t drop the class because the add/drop period is over and I really don’t want to withdraw but this is ridiculous and I don’t want to miss anymore classes. 

Do you guys have any tips or ideas on what to do in my situation? I remember that guy saying how he loovvved 8ams and I wanted to slap him in the face lol, I hate it.",college

They are also significantly higher priced than other programs I’ve been looking at. Including in person programs here in the state of TX. 
I like that they are CACREP accredited and their program meets TX state licensure requirements.

Is your degree recognized/respected by employers? What was your takeaway on the program or faculty/overall experience?

I'm a graduate student in Cybersecurity with a non-technical background in liberal arts. Currently, I'm in my second quarter, taking introductory courses in Data Structures & Computer Systems. Many of my classmates are also from non-tech backgrounds. My interest in computers and technology developed during a gap year after my undergrad, leading me to pursue cybersecurity.

While I maintained a solid GPA during my undergrad, I faced challenges to reach that point. Although I performed well in my initial cyber intro courses, this quarter has been unexpectedly difficult. Despite having coped with difficult professors in the past, the intensity of my current classes is unparalleled. To put it into perspective, I never scored below a B in undergrad, even when prioritizing harder courses over other courses. However, this quarter, I've received grades as low as 60 and 70 on quizzes, and I fear I may have failed a midterm. Another midterm is looming, adding to my anxiety.

So, a little background about me, I'm a freshman and it's just the second semester and engineering has drained everything out of me.

I don't even know why I picked engineering, I'm bad and not interested in physics and math. I'm not even trying in any of my major engineering subjects. Ever since I started engineering school, I feel depressed all the time, I don't feel like myself, and my mental health has taken a toll.

What I'm asking is if I'm betraying myself if I'm changing my major. I have this dilemma because I don't think I can become an engineer and pass all the rigorous classes. Part of why maybe brcause I'm not trying anymore. I also feel like I will be wasting a year and a ton of money since I took a lot of engineering majors that wouldn't be credited if I switched. I really don't know ehat to do if I should power through or escape engineering hell.

I go to work and I have hobbies on the side, I've been going out more, I started working out and has gotten back into drawing. I've just gotten through another breakup, this semester and the previous one both involved a breakup in the beginning of the semester and they were both rough, even though the most recent one was two months but still had a huge impact on me.   
The one before this recent one was extremely hard since I was going through a lot more shit at once within 3 months (2 new jobs, obviously breakup, fight w/ best friends resulting in me being more alone, constant headaches, got pulled over for the first time, etc.). The recent one, this is the most I've done with someone (I'm not going to go into depth cuz that's not the point lol) and I know deep down I would be handling it well-- however, I just reached about a month of getting an IUD. I ended getting the one that has the lowest dosage of hormones and it has really fucked with my emotions a lot, even causing me to become depressed/emotionally unstable.  
BUT, in a way I'm taking care of myself, like I stated earlier. But, I'm struggling hardcore to do school work. It was like this in the previous breakup and of course, I'm dealing with it again. But it's just school, I have motivation to do anything else-- Laundry, eat, workout, take care of myself, go to work, etc. I take Concerta (ADHD meds) and that's not even helping, my dad is paying since the new job I have doesn't pay enough for me to pay like my previous job did and in order for him to continuing paying, I need to have my grades @ a B or above by each payment. This time he let me off the hook with a probation warning since my parents knew what I'm going through.

It's frustrating, sincerely it is. I know my knowledge/IQ or whatever has gone down ever since COVID, even though I'm in college, but I do want to continue my education, pass, and so on.

1678,1707948542.0,Should I bring up my roommate's alcohol use to her?,"Throwaway account because my main account is easily identifiable.  I am currently a junior in college and I share an apartment with one of my best friends here and two girls who we aren't as close with.  Lately, I've been noticing some concerning patterns with my friend/roommate's alcohol use.  The two of us share a friend group that goes out 2-3x per month and does weekly movie nights/kickbacks where we drink a bit and I've been known to occasionally have a few while watching movies/documentaries on my own, so it's not like I'm being puritanical about this.  Her drinking habits have just raised several red flags for me lately, and I'm wondering if I should bring it up to her/how I should do so. Some examples that have concerned me are as follows:

\- We started out the year with about a half-full 1.75L handle of vodka that we shared (I had it leftover from the summer).  I had exactly 2 shots of it as a pregame one time and the rest was drunk by her within the first month-ish of the semester, along with a second 1.75L bottle that she bought and mostly finished before winter break.  I know for a fact she was drinking it alone because she and I share the same friends and she isn't close with anybody else enough to have them over/go out with them (the rest of our core ""group"" of 6 has other friends from our classes that we'll occasionally go out with and therefore not hang out as a group for a week or two, but she's more antisocial and really only talks to the 5 of us.  She's even expressed animosity towards the idea when I've suggested making other friends so she has other options when our group isn't hanging out)

\- She's now onto her 3rd? 4th? 1.75L bottle of vodka for the school year and there's probably only one shot left in it, not sure how long she's had it.

\- Last week alone there were around 20 empty cans in our recycling, several of which were tall boys.  I know they were hers, not our other roommates', because I saw her bringing the cases in the week prior.

\- I see the worst of it because I live with her, but two of our mutual friends have reached out to me to ask me about her drinking because the patterns spill into her life outside our apartment (i.e. while the rest of us will be quite drunk and having a good time, we can still get home safely and be aware of our surroundings, while she'll need help getting home and we've considered calling an ambulance for her before because she's so drunk).  We'll encourage her to slow down/drink water at the pregame/when we're out because we know she's prone to drink more quickly than the rest of us, but she doesn't always listen.

\- She also texts the groupchat about being drunk when she's home a lot more than the rest of us will.  I.e. ""oh my goodness my sister and I pregamed this lazer tag too hard I feel like I'm gonna puke haha"", and it seems like all she does at home is pregame things that don't need pregaming with her sister and her home friends, and then texts me or the group to tell us about it.  I can also tell she's drunk and not exaggerating because the sentences are more incoherent than usual.

\- I checked the level of her vodka bottle monday morning and monday afternoon (maybe I'm snooping a bit too hard at this point, idrc) and she had to have had at least 3-4 shots in the time I was on campus (roughly 10am-4pm).  I was starting to convince myself that I was overreacting to this whole thing, but I really don't think I am.

\- She also drinks a lottt more when her boyfriend is here (he goes to another college) and he usually doesn't drink at all which is a whole other can of worms I don't want to open.

All in all, I'm really worried for her.  A lot of other stuff has been happening in her life and I've been a listening ear to her complaints and rants about it, and I try to be supportive, but I feel like without saying anything about the elephant in the room, I can't fully be there for her the way I want to.  Does anyone have any experience with something similar?  I don't want to make things awkward or make it a confrontational event as we're living together for the rest of this year and next, but I am also extremely concerned by this behavior and want to make it known to her that I'm available if she needs/wants to talk about it.

Now in general I see myself working with computers for a long time because I genuinely like tech but I’ve realized that I can tolerate coding, but don’t necessarily love it. I would rather have a balance in coding so any role like r/devops or r/sre that mixes IT and coding together. So I’m not coding all day long for typical activities. 

When I’m in class I’m not enjoying relearning the same concepts again. The only recent class that stimulated me was a statistics course that I took and enjoyed using R and python to make data look pretty. I also have done r/homelab projects in the past that were interesting and fun to complete

So now… there is a major that I can switch to possibly that has my interest. And that major is Computational and Data Science (CDS) and it seems as if like a cousin of CS with the main focus being centered around data science, not sure how much coding is required in the major but if I switch would have about 36 credits, 3 semesters left to graduate and I can take courses online.

1687,1707938136.0,Would it be rude to email my professor about this?,"TLDR: I’m wondering if it would be rude to email my tech professor and let her know how to force mute members on Zoom because of the continuous disruptions.

I’m taking a digital tech class (the actual name isn’t important since the professor only teaches tech related classes) online and we only have one Zoom meeting per week. The professor is super nice, but, this is her first time using zoom to teach and she doesn’t know how to use it (ironically). I know for a fact she doesn’t 100% know how to work it because she told us that the first week of class. 

Anyways, the class is only 1 and 1/2hrs long. Every single week, there’s two students who are continuously disruptive (asking the professor irrelevant personal questions like what her favorite genre of music is?? Etc.) but whatever I don’t think that’s my place to call them out and it’s a good opportunity to practice my deep breathing exercises anyway. 

My problem is that MULTIPLE times per class they unmute themselves and my professor has to wait for a pause of silence to tell them to mute themselves. Last week, for example, one of them was unmuted and was listening to a completely different lecture. So, we all had to wait for about 2 minutes and listen to this guys other class because it was so loud the professor couldn’t tell him to turn his mic off. Not to mention there is the occasional accidentally unmute from other members (usually not very disruptive). It’s to the point where we’ve actually run out of time to cover content because of the disruptions. 

So, my question is would it be rude/inappropriate to email my professor and let her know that she can force mute people so we don’t have to keep wasting time? I don’t want her to think I’m telling her how to teach her class and I don’t want to offend her (especially because it’s directly related to the courses she teaches!!)

And honestly? I love the classes. I’m succeeding in them, A’s in all. Not only do I find them easy, I’m super interested in them. I have all classes pertaining to this on Tues/Thurs and those are the days I look forward to by a longshot. But I am concerned about finding a good job in this field.

What can I do? What do I do? Do I abandon the field I’ve been into since childhood? Do I push through it? What If I regret not switching?

I’m so fucking frustrated right now. My STEM classes make me feel like a failure. I can barely get above a C in them. But everytime I get back a writing/reading response or quiz, all I hear is good things. Please tell me I’m not alone in this?",college

1715,1707894451.0,My roommate treats me like shit after me and my ex broke up,"So these last couple of weeks have been pretty shit. I just went back to college after winter break, and talked with my ex about something we texted during winter break, which was about us. In the end we both decided to stop talking for a while since we both needed some distance, which started no contact between us. I talked to one of my roommates about it, lets call him Joe. Joe got along with my ex but nothing more than that, since they didn't hang out. The moment I talked to Joe about my situation he called her a bitch for what she did, which surprised me and I didn't think was right, since my ex and I ended mutually and never have spoken bad about her.

It turns out that right after we broke up, Joe and my ex started hanging out a lot. This really pissed me off, especially since I was moving on. I ended up distancing myself from Joe to work on myself after said breakup, which really helped me feel better and moving on from my ex, I even ended up making new friends and getting out of my comfort zone. I think that Joe saw this as something bad, and every time try I would start to strike up a conversation with him he would say things like ""no one gives a fuck"" or ""no one cares"", even if i was having a conversation with someone else and he was in the corner of the room.

Then his birthday came up, and he was planning on getting together with all of us and his friends in our college dorm. He asked me if he could invite my ex, and I straight up told him ""no"", and that ""it really fucks me up that they both hangout when i am trying to move on"", he understood and was cool with it. When the time came, I saw that nothing was done for the party, it turns out that he kind of expected everyone to get the stuff for him, which is why no one showed up in the end, and ended hanging out in another friend's college dorm. When i went into our room, I told Joe we were in our friend's dorm room and that we were gonna come back soon to celebrate his party. I mentioned that we should bring the party to Joe and I's room, but in the end no one wanted to show up to his birthday reunion, due to his behavior towards everyone. Joe ended up getting food with my ex, since a close friend of mine saw them. Ever since this happened he has been even more rude me, even to the point where he would make it clear that him and my ex would hang out when i was in the room, at this point I was already over her, but it really pissed me off. I started asking my close friends for advice and they all mention that this is a ""dick move"", and he just ""wants attention"". I avoid talking bad about him behind his back at all time, I just express myself about how I feel in this situation. My friends have seen both of them hanging out every day, and the weirdest thing is that Joe apparently now has a girlfriend (days after me and my ex broke up) but does not mention her name or anything about her to people, but still ""brags about it"", as my close friends are saying.

TL;DR, my roommate started acting like shit to me after my ex and I broke up.",college

I don’t have any friends near me, I’ve never partied, never made any real memories throughout high school or the last two years. I basically didn’t live during high school. I’m scared that when I get to dorms and I try to socialize at university, I’m scared that I’ll be that awkward strange kid I was in HS and I wanna make sure I live life to the fullest. It’s not like I’m particularly insecure or anything, I’m not anti social. I’m a likeable person, funny, attractive, easy to get along with, fun I’m just nervous about that initial phase. Like how do I meet people at uni? Do I just walk up and introduce myself? It’s been a while since I properly socialized. The last time I really met new people was like almost two years ago in my senior year of HS. I made a few friends and loved it but it’s been so long that I’ve kinda forget how to socialize. Like I love having friends and being around people, it’s just the start that’s awkward.

Like I wanna hang out with people, make memories, go to clubs, go to parties, go on trips and do dumb shit. I made an agreement with myself that when I’ll get there I’ll say yes to everything (within reason) and try talking to as many people as possible.

1719,1707886944.0,"Advice for lack of motivation, anxiety, and depression with getting through college","Hey everyone, i'm typing here today because i've been dealing with alot of stuff that i dont know how to deal with it. Its effecting my quality of life and the things i need to get done. I'll start off with im a 21 y/o male, work full time as a assistant manager at KFC and take 4 College Classes. I started having alot of these issues back in september of 2023. In May of that year, i had ended a long term friendship with a woman who i had alot of strong feelings for and i was really hurt by it and i can admit almost a year later its still on my mind today.   


Main issue im struggling with is that i have an incredibly hard time with getting going for the day. I dont get up early and eat breakfast, comb my hair, brush my teeth, etc. I literally get up last second for work/school, get dressed and leave. For work and school i have to leave the house around 8, i usually get up at 7:50. I try to get up early; i set multiple alarms and i set my smart light in my room to turn on early to force myself to wake up, but i just end up rolling over back to sleep.   


Then outside my waking up habits, ive struggled alot to be productive and get things done, like school work. Alot of times when i get home from school and work, i should be getting work done but instead i go into my bed, immediately knock out and either take anywhere from a 30 minute to a 3 hour nap and i waking up feeling super fatigued and just unable to get anything done. My days off from work and school, I have an even worse time getting up, i wake up around 9-10am but keep trying to roll over and fall asleep again so i never get up  until 11ish. then i literally just stay in bed watching videos on my phone.   


The last thing i would like to talk about is when im actually getting school work done. When im doing school work i really have a hard time focusing, i tend to get anxious and stressed or even distracted by anything while doing school work. Which all of that makes me lose alot of my motivation and i just feel shitty about myself.

I know this is alot. I personally feel like im dealing with depression and anxiety and im trying to go to the doctor but its hard right now to get an appointment set up.

Ever since around Senior year of high school, I've wanted to major in Social Work and become an advocate. So that's the major I came in declaring. But, I'm taking my first class surrounding this major, and I'm bored as hell, and I'm not sure I'd be able to separate my work and home life to the appropriate extent needed for this job.

The course is enjoyable because until now, I have taken all of my lab-based sciences online. I finally get to work in a physical lab environment. However, it is not what I was hoping for. 

My group rarely talks and collaborates with one another. We are a group, yet we do not work together. When working in a group, especially in a lab, I want us all checking in with each other to ensure we know what we're doing. There's none of that! There's always some weird tension in our group. Rarely anyone speaks up or takes the lead.

I'm not sure if it's because my group doesn't understand what we're doing, or because they do but want to keep to themselves. And most of the time, I feel excluded, confused, and misled. Everyone has their belongings on the table, but there isn't enough space for me to work with them. I have tried hinting it to them, but no one moves. I’m always the last one to finish because of it. Furthermore, when I communicate with my group that I need help or do not understand the procedure, barely anyone responds. Willingly anyway. I'd have to ask my professor or reread the steps, which does not help much.

Furthermore, when it comes to results day, hardly anyone discusses their analysis of the experiments or their answers to the ""mastering concepts"" questions from the lab book. Even when they do, I am rarely included. I'd have to either fill in the blanks myself or get the answers from the other group. As I previously stated, we are in a group, but we do not collaborate. I might as well be working alone.

It's irritating because I look at the other group, and while they're also kind of quiet, I can tell they're actually working together and helping each other.",college

At first I wanted to go to Columbia College Chicago, but she’s from that area and people get killed in the loop all the time, so she uses that against me. (I live in Illinois too.) 

So I tried other places and other options but she’s so picky about it, she doesn’t want me to go to the big cities until I’m “ready.” But honestly, I don’t even think I can take risks myself and optimistically make a decision on any college, I had plans for New York, Vegas, Atlanta, Virginia, NC, and just places with a thriving arts community.

1737,1707857890.0,I haven’t made a single friend here. I’m so lonely.,"Hi. I’m a transfer student at a new college and I’m living on campus. I transferred this semester. I live in a single dorm (because of my disabilities and service dog) so I do not have a roommate, which I prefer anyways because of the nature of my disabilities.

I am 23 years old so technically I should have graduated in 2022 but because of my health, I had to take several medical leaves and was only able to complete 2 full years at my old college. So I still have 4-5 semesters left at this new college before I graduate.

I love this school but I have not made any friends and I know it’s partially my fault because I’m not particularly good at initiating conversation or anything like that. I’m autistic as well so making friends can be quite hard. At my old college, I did make friends though. They just sorta happened naturally.

I feel really lonely having no friends at my college. It doesn’t help that I’m probably one of the oldest students living on campus and I feel like an outlier in that regard too.

Does anyone have any advice on how I can make friends besides joining clubs or sports? Even just having one friend would make me feel so much less alone :(

Also, would people not want to be my friend for the fact that I am 23 and technically a 2nd semester sophomore? Is that cringe? Do people judge that kind of thing?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",college
1738,1707857054.0,How can I deal with being different?,"Hello everyone, 

first of all, sorry for any error, English is not my mother tongue. Also sorry for the wall of text.

I started my Master's programme this month and right now I try to get to know as many classmates as I can. It is only a short programme which worried me a bit before; I started my Bachelor's during Covid and barely met people from my course back then. That is why I want to make friends here or at least try my best to have a good social life after having nothing.

I consider myself to be quite open, though I am also shy and I need some time to adjust to new social situations. Next to that I also have to adjust to a new university setting as I am also studying in another country now, though not far away from home. Like, I can drive by car back home in a short time.

Today after class I went to the library with 4 classmates and I was happy that I took that chance. While talking with them, I realized 2 things though:

First of all, finances. Even though my studies just started, I already have anxiety regarding money. I am still waiting for a letter regarding student financial aid, but I am not even sure if I receive some. I got a job in a restaurant, but I rather want to work druing vacation so that I can focus on my studies and social life here. Talking to the others, I realized that they are quite rich. They are talking about the internship that they want to do abroad (""oh they are unpaid, well, that doesn't matter""- internship in New York or Paris) and their former universities which I consider very expensive. Someone asked me where I want to go to for an internship (like what country or city) and basically, I had to say that I am too poor to go somewhere abroad. Although they seemed to understand me and not ask me further, they also seemed to be confused. I am grateful for the support I get from home, but there is still the feeling that I miss important opportunities that help me later in my career. And I mean, an internship in New York would be a dream of mine as I seek experience in foreign countries.

Another topic is love. To break it down, I am in my early 20s and I haven't had any romantic or sexual experience, plus I am asexual and have no interest in casual dating or ONS. I don't lack sex, but a romantic relationship as I never had one and I kind of feel the pressure from society, if that makes sense. I mean, even my mom asks if I already met a pretty guy. I really try to work on it but it is not easy. Within the same library group today, they talked about the weekends where they get drunk (I don't drink though I am very happy with that so that is not an issue) and have ONS or how they started dating someone etc. For me it sounded like a typical scene from these US College setting movies, if that makes sense. Others are in long-term relationships. Of course I only talked to 4 people, but it makes me feel like I am quite the outsider with my non-experience-and-being-single. It kind of made me feel bad about myself and hours afterwards, I am still thinking about this. 

I just don't want to compare myself and see myself as a loser but want to have the best social life I can. Maybe someone has been in the same situation (also with other aspects maybe)? I would be grateful to receive some tips about how to deal with this as I also feel like this is the first time I really have to deal with this in social interactions (thanks Covid).",college

I thought I made two friends. Last year was great with them. They called me to spend time on their room time-to time. They never invited me to hang out though but I didn't mind that. For clarification, those two girls are roommates. I live in another room.

But I've noticed drastic shift last semester. They became very close to each other and started ignoring me. We never really messaged each other outside the school like regular friends do so I never heard form either of them on weekends or during the holidays. I tried to initiate conversations through messenger but it always ended with short answers and I stopped trying pursuing the conversations outside of the uni.

But this semester it got extremely weird. One of the girls started ignoring me in person, barely talking to me. I always had to ask her questions, I felt like I was forcing her to talk. She talked to others just fine.

I took a week off when I was feeling sick. Another classmate of mine sent me some study materials and this girl who ignores me apparently told her not to send me anything.

When I found this out, I felt betrayed and sad. The worst thing is that I've been feeling depressed last few weeks and this information just worsened my state. To clarify, I didn't tell them I am depressed. I didn't bother them with that and I tried to look happy so that couldn't be the reason for this.

I am originally from Texas (my family still lives there) but I moved to Florida in August of 2023.

I am very eager to continue my education at a university here but I started my job (paying taxes) in October of 2023 — though I was hired in August. I am looking to start school back in the fall of 2024, but technically I don’t have any sort of documentation to prove I was living here two months before I started work. My license, insurance, and car registration all didn’t start until Jan of 2024. In a perfect world, I’d start school this coming summer semester. 

Would it be better to wait until the spring semester of 2025 to start back so that I can qualify for 
in-state tuition? I would be almost 22. It feels like a shame that I’d need to wait so long but I want to be the most financially intelligent that I can be.

Another option is abroad. I am not interested in the US, so that leaves the UK. However, I heard that the good universities there are ridiculously expensive, and there's no way my parents will let me go there.

So my question is, does anybody know any good universities that isn't too expensive and teaches biology or an aspect of biology in English? Or at what condition will I be able to get something like financial aid? (I mean my family isn't poor or anything, around middle income level in Switzerland, which is better than a lot of the places in the world, but cost of living is also extremely high here)",college

1769,1707822305.0,Choosing a Major,"Choosing Major advice?

Hello. To introduce myself a bit: I am an 11th grade high school student currently lost about which major to pursue. I dreamed of being Architect but now I’m not sure.

Obviously, I would like to major in Architecture but I know the market is quite saturated and despite having a passion for it - I want to live a higher middle class life. I know money isn’t everything, but it helps a lot. So, I looked into Civil Engineering which isn’t the same but it has a lot of relations to Architecture. I’m aware of its difficulties since my parents have connections to some and it’s a male dominated field (in my country both are male dominated, CE more so). I’m less knowledgeable in this area so much information is appreciated. 

My mom and stepdad did recommend going into accounting to become an audit, but I’m not particularly interested in anything related to social sciences or humanities. But if it is worth it in the sense I would have a stable life, I’d consider it.

And what are my goals for a career? Just something I wouldn’t hate doing (such as IT or Law) , pays well and contributes to society. Bonus points if it can help the environment. What are my strengths? I’ve been told I’m very crafty and creative, I do well enough in stem and I’m a leader in most of my projects. Downside is that I find humanities not as interesting and I’m quite sensitive. Additionally, I don’t mind learning more skills or start things from scratch. 

Any advice or recommendations would help a lot :)",college

i turn 26 on the 4th & I feel kinda lost in life.

how do you guys know for sure what career path to go with?

 realistically, I’m not the smartest person - I think I would need to retake classes and take a lot of refreshers and have tutoring to get me through any degree.

1791,1707778050.0,More specific making friends advice,"TL;DR: I need more specific friend/making advice than the average website will give me.

This might violate rule 7 for being “generic” or “easily google-able” but stuff I’ve found online doesn’t really answer my questions. Everything says to go to clubs and to talk to the people next to you in class and stuff like that but I don’t know *how* to talk to people.

When people suggest just sitting next to someone and introducing yourself I feel like everyone but me has some innate ability to talk to people they don’t know at all with full confidence.

I’ve joined a couple clubs and have even started to make friends with an a cappella group I joined, but I can’t seem to make friends with anyone in it to the point where we would hang out outside of club meetings, they’re really fun in the club but outside no one invited me to anything and as the new member I feel super awkward being the one to invite to anything, let alone the fact that I have nothing to invite them *to*.

So really my question I guess is just how do you talk to people in your classes to the point of hanging out outside of them? Right now I mainly just want people I can comfortably invite to lunch or something similar.

I feel awfully invasive if people around me are already having a conversation and I join them, and I can’t even strike a conversation with the person next time if I wanted to, since basically everyone sits with at least one seat between them and the person next to them. At least that’s the way it is with me.",college

I’m sure part of it is age. I know the brain becomes less malleable as we get older but I’m doing what I can to help alleviate that issue.

Our first exam is due this Friday, and he hasn't added the time, nor has he filled out the Alternative Testing Agreement that all my other profs have.

The Disability Resource Center (DRC) basically said they'll try to email him but if he doesn't respond there's nothing they can really do. His office hours don't happen until the day the test is due, and the DRC closes early that day, so even if he filled it out right then they wouldn't have time to process it. I'm at a loss for what to do. I've never had a prof be so uncommunicative, and this whole situation has made me feel so unwelcome as someone disabled in college. Those imposter syndrome thoughts creep up sometimes, and now they've increased tenfold. It's not like I've been asking for a luxury. I get the feeling he just doesn't want to have to manually change the times for each test of mine...

1798,1707772925.0,"My professor has said things that are personally offensive, but my current situation has me scared to do something. What should I do?","For context, I’m in my last semester of community college, taking my last required course before I can transfer to the university I want to go to. I already submitted my transfer application, so that university will treat this in-progress course as though I have passed it when deciding who is accepted and who is not. The college I go to is more or less a feeder school, so getting in should not be a problem unless I mess up.

The current course professor, however, has said and done things that have, for lack of a better phrase, pissed me off. Course-wise, she will leave chunks of the lessons to instructional videos instead of teaching the class itself. They give labs that have instructions that aren’t very clear, and it’s compounded by how these labs require using a software they have no interest in properly teaching us how to use. Some of the time, instead of properly correcting students of their mistakes, they’ll harshly tell us “No, redo that, you clearly didn’t follow instructions”. Their tests are arguably longer than what can usually be done within the class period window (an hour and fifteen minutes). It doesn’t really help how they make up over 50% of our grade, with the next highest percent value being 20% on the final exam. But this isn’t the main issue.

When it comes to personality, they have said things that are completely unbecoming of the job and title they have. For added context, I’m taking this class with my brother. My brother is in the same situation as me (last semester, transferring, application done). We’re twins, and we both have ADHD and anxiety, but he is in a far worse state when it comes to both. He isn’t the best at math, and he does not think he’s smart at all (this is at the fault of several teachers throughout his time in school who basically told him to his face he was stupid). This is not the case. I’ve seen him get straight A’s. 

Nonetheless, when you combine those previously mentioned factors, he’s just going to be one of those students who needs to and will ask for help when he’s confused (or frozen up due to the pace some classes can go). This teacher, in the first week of class, insulted his intelligence and how he was the only one who didn’t understand what was going on since my brother was confused with the directions they were giving on how to find all those specific buttons on the TI-84 calculator we’re required to use. He has never used one before in his life, and the professor was mad at him for this. One time, after class, they asked him if he was seeing a psychiatrist/therapist for his issues, and of course my brother felt pressured to answer. That is, obviously, a complete disregard for and breach of privacy.

As for me, this past week they made a statement on telling the difference between me and my brother, since we do look alike. She, in front of the *entire* class, referred to me as being the “heavier” one of the two. Me and my brother are ~6’3, but I’m ~205 pounds and my brother is ~180. Weight is something I am severely self-conscious about, and I weigh 30 lbs. less than I did a year ago. However, effectively being called fat in front of my classmates still hurts. The statement hurt enough that I almost started stress eating as soon as I got home.

I want to tell the department chair or whatever proper academic authority immediately about the things this professor has said. But I’m scared that it will just make things worse. I’ve dealt with our college’s bureaucracy with some redtape paperwork issue before, and it didn’t go well. If I tell somebody now and it doesn’t work and the professor finds out, I’m worried they’ll take that out on my grade. If it does work and they do something, this professor might try to pin it on the idea of me being angry that my brother is struggling (he isn’t at a passing grade at the moment). While the action of screwing a student’s grade for solely personal reasons is both rare and outlandish, I’m not giving this professor the benefit of doubt.

On the *other* hand, if I wait until the end of the semester and classes are done, the same two possibilities still linger: if I wait, they could brush it off solely because the semester is done and in the rear view mirror. The chance of my brother not passing is also there, so even if they *do* look into it at the end, this professor could say it was out of some vengeance for failing my brother and preventing him from transferring.

It’s freaking me out, but I’d like to tell someone now while other students’ memories of what the professor said is still fresh to use as evidence, I cannot let this become a “he said, she said” case. Also, if I wait, my brother’s success is even *less* likely because he simply does worse when he has bad teachers or professors. Should I deal this now, or let it be?

I’m sorry if this post violates the discussing college admissions rule with the whole context of transferring, but it contextualizes my fear of doing something about all of this.

Yet, the coursework doesn't reflect this excitement, and doesn't feel like valid experience. If you're like me, you struggle to actually make friends within the anti-social culture of the major. I feel my well-being only getting worse with each passing term, and I somehow still have a long way to go.

Internships are rare, and the barrier of entry to contribute to online projects is significant. I know many people who graduate, even after years of this struggle, only to be faced with a substantial experience requirements for junior positions.

I'm currently a third-year student majoring in EECS (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) at IISER (Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research) in India. I study in a research-based college, and lately, I've been feeling quite lost about my career path.

Here's a bit of background: I recently completed an internship in December where I worked on core electronics device modeling. While the experience was valuable, I found the work challenging, and I'm not sure about the job opportunities and growth prospects in this field. Additionally, I'm uncertain about the financial aspects of pursuing research, such as funding for a PhD. I've heard mixed opinions about job availability in academia, which has added to my confusion.

Considering these uncertainties, I've been contemplating switching my focus to cybersecurity or computer science. I believe these fields offer opportunities both in industry and research, providing a potentially more stable career path.

However, I'm at a crossroads and would greatly appreciate some advice or guidance. Here are a few specific questions I have:

1. How do I assess whether I'm on the right track with my current specialization in EECS, or if I should pivot towards cybersecurity/CS?
2. What are the job prospects and growth opportunities like in the fields of electronics device modeling versus cybersecurity/CS?
3. How do funding and financial support work for research programs like a PhD? Is it feasible to pursue a PhD without worrying too much about financial constraints?
4. Considering my interest in pursuing a master's degree, what would be the best approach: a) Doing my master's at my current college b) Writing the GATE exam and attending IITs for my master's c) Gaining work experience for a few years before pursuing a master's d) Pursuing a master's degree abroad

I'm open to any insights, personal experiences, or advice you may have. Your guidance could really help me navigate this crucial decision in my academic and professional journey. Thank you in advance for your support!",college

1820,1707706694.0,Parents are discouraging me to going to a UC.,"So I recently got accepted to UCB for Computer Science Engineering and I have always wanted to go there! My parents however have been discouraging me from going. I have a health condition that makes me super tired at certain times and they say that I would struggle going to a top college for such a competitive major. They say that living in dorms, means that I wouldn’t be able to sleep whenever I need to, and my lifestyle would completely be difficult. I’m also vegetarian (and im super picky on what I eat) and they say that this will also present some challenges for me as dorm food won’t taste good and have very limited vegetarian options. 

They are telling me to go to less competitive schools like uc merced, state university nearby, or even community college. 

I know they mean well for me but I don’t know what I should do. Berkeley has always been the dream but now I am doubting myself. Can I handle the competitive workload while living without my parents? 

And if it does seem to be a challenge for me, how hard is it to switch to ucsc or ucr later on from Berkeley? 

P.S money is not an issue in this situation. Wherever I end up going they will support me financially.

EDIT: I do want to add on that my illness is sometimes super severe that I need to ask my parents to pick me up from school in the middle of the school day so that I can go home to sleep. Sometimes it’s hard for me to focus/memorize. Sometimes I’m fine, I can run 1-2 miles easily and focus really good. 
Berkeley is about 3-4 hours where I live so it’d be hard for me to travel often to see them and likewise for them. 

Don’t say see a doctor, I have, many of them. There is no permanent solution for this. I just need some advice about this college situation.

1831,1707678903.0,Should I stay full time/go part time/ or drop out?,"Back story: I am a junior in college with around 70 credit hours (Business Degree). I am very fortunate in that I have not had to pay out of pocket for any of my schooling due to tuition assistance I receive and scholarships. I have a relative that works at the school and I received scholarships due to my good grades in high school and my ACT score. That being said, after my first semester of college I knew this was something that I did not want to do, but I have continued anyway because I believed it would be stupid to turn down free school.

Side story: I am currently a pilot and flight instructor. I started working at the airport my senior year of high school, and not long after I started flight lessons. During my freshman year of college I continued to work at the airport and pursue my instrument rating. I took my instrument checkride with an examiner who happen to own a specialty flight school, and after passing, he offered me a job working in his hangar. I took him up on this offer and started working for him my sophomore year of college and throughout this time I continued to work on my ratings. In about about a year of working for him, I was able get an additional 5 ratings, including my flight instructor certificate, which gave me a promotion from hangar boy to flight instructor. During this time I didn't have much of a life as all I did was work, fly, and go to school, but I am forever thankful for how this opportunity accelerated my career. At of the begging of this year I have also taken on a more managerial role at the school in addition to my normal instructing.

Present day: Now I am in a position where I have the opportunity to fly and build hours and gain experience in actual aviation management, but I feel that I am having to turn down opportunities and focus my time at completing my school work instead of flying or working . I feel like I am slowing down or hindering my career by being in school, which has made me build up a massive amount of resentment and anger, making it difficult for me mentally to complete my school work. In addition to this, from my experience, at least at my university, I feel that the saying ""If you cant do it, teach it"" definitely applies as I have learned 20x more through working than in my classes.

I am a 24M and the girl I was seeing was a 21F, junior in college. I graduated 2 years ago and live in a big city ~1hr and 30 mins away from her. 

We were really good and really happy for 8 months. I always made an effort to go to her, or her to come to me (its just an hour and a half train I’d pay for her everytime)

But recently she kind of pulled away and I am really upset.

 I honestly think she sort of realized that even though she liked me, she didn’t wanna be tied down to some dude 3 years older living in a completely different state (I am from her town though in said state, she went to a college in our state) while shes still young in college suppose to be free and having fun. Her exact words and it was devastating to hear but she said she doesn’t wanna be at frat parties and out at school and “Have any chance of potentially hurting me” Sucks a lot for me but I understand where shes coming from I guess. 

She says I am her “ideal husband”, wants to travel the world together,  and sees us getting married just she can’t be super serious and commit right now. Honestly I sort of reacted poorly and just said we shouldn’t  talk again in the future and let this book and chapter close. In my eyes I see it as I don’t wanna be strung along and she can get with other people and when shes ready and bored just come back to me like I’m a sad puppy waiting, like I am just some option she can have whenever.

Im 21 and have emailed over 30 universities in Canada if they could let me complete the degree faster by overloading the number of courses per semester, but the maximum overload they allow is just 1 course per semester and that too after going through a shit load of bureaucracy. 

The main frustration is that is nobody seems to even notice this , let alone have a problem with it. Not a single student. They are just ready to waste their (4 years — Duration according to their potential) of time. Same is for high school, how can that not be reduced by 3-4 years for people who are ambitious enough? Instead of promoting people to be ambitious, the ambitious are gate-kept.  

I am ready to afford college while working minimum wage for 2 years, but not 4 years. 

If gas prices increase by 20 cents, it’s questioned like hell, becomes a national news, but a place where so many years are just getting wasted into inefficiency, the monetary -but not the only- value of which is hundreds of thousands of dollars itself, is not even being noticed.  I just cannot wrap my head around that to come to an understanding as to how that is even possible. 

More incidents: 

> So apparently, it takes 4 years to learn literally every field of study from engineering to english. Wow what a coincidence. 


>Colleges want a 4-year degree for masters, 3-year not valid. Ok, understandable, why not just ask the individuals with 3-year degrees to take some extra courses to make them ready for the master’s program?


>The last university I contacted would accept a 4 year non CS degree with 10 courses related to CS but not about 3 year CS degree with 25 courses related to CS. Wow, how logical. 


>There are some masters programs in US or maybe even Canada which do not require the bachelors in the same field but still make it compulsory. If bachelors is not related anyways, then how is it different from having no bachelors at all? To make them competent for the master’s program, they make them take 12 foundational courses. If 12 courses is all that it takes to get ready, then why require a bachelors at all?

>Bachelors required for med school. Now that one is actually very logical as it wants doctors to serve 4 less years in the service, isn’t it? Oh, merit? Is a bachelors the only way to test merit? Can it just not be dependent on an exam +  interview? 

>Bachelors required to be elligible for CPA exams, if you are going to test the skills anyways through the exams, then why require bachelors at all? 

If there is a 14 year old who wants to go to med school, why is there no pathway for him to prove his passion and merit for it. Oh, would the 14 year old not be competent enough to handle the load? Well, then he won’t pass the exam and interview anyways. That’s for merit to decide, not you. 

Again, the main problem/frustration is not what’s mentioned above but that nobody even seems to even notice this illogical gatekeeping.

These are the things I cannot wrap my head around and request them to be explained to me as to how frustrating this all is.

EDIT: Now a thing that would actually be practical is to allow people to view prerecorded lectures online and then give exam to prove competency. Okay okay, now before you go on, I know education is much more than just gaining knowledge, it’s about being provided with feedback and supervision on each and every step. It’s about teaching how to approach a problem and not just give a formula. It is about teaching how to think, perform analysis, and then supervising at each and every step as to how to approach it. But that doesn’t happen in the universities anyways. It’s more lecture driven rather than discussion nor it is much in depth. So if there isn’t any of that anyways, why not just let people view lectures online and give exams? And the score on those exams could be used to let people get enrolled for pre-doc because thats a thing that cannot be done by prerecorded lectures anyways. Then pre-doc for PHD. ",college

I wanted to move in next year to the house but also scared cause none of the girls know the exact payment so its bound to increase and they have already told me certain fees but in last minute increased it by over thousands so I dont want to end up paying more last minute especially since they dont have any sort of financial breakdown or anything. Also a lot of the girls and I just dont get a long like their personality and mine are so different. i think in the house i get a long with 3 girls.

I sent a message ccing everyone to exchange contact info. one groupmate reached out after a day or so and seemed eager to get the project done. we decided to just start while waiting for the others. i created the google doc and slides. however, they've ghosted since then. later that evening, another groupmate reached out so i filled them in on everything we're doing. they seemed cooperative and even asked me to assigned them their task.

1870,1707601933.0,Nursing or Business Analytics?,"Hi, I want to give some background information prior to getting into this situation I’m currently in. I’m a freshman in college. I was initially at university doing Biology Pre-Pharmacy, I’m now in my second semester at a community college as undecided. Huge shift. I know. 

When I was at university, I was working around 20-25 hours a week. Most days I would go to school from 7:00 AM - 9:00 PM because I would be studying for an upcoming exam or quiz. I didn’t have a life. I was tired and frustrated all the time. I ended up with straight A’s but I was also sleep deprived, practically failing the first two months, and beyond stressed. I worked my ass off for those A’s. Ultimately, I decided I didn’t like how I was feeling and switched out of the school completely to save money until I finalized a decision on what to do with my life. 

Fast forward to today, I’m a liberal arts major (Undecided), I’m currently in between Business Analytics, initially thought of pursuing this major but am genuinely terrified of the results. All I’ve ever heard was business was insecure and there’s always difficulties establishing yourself and getting a job after. So that’s really demotivating, and I’m not sure if I want to dedicate time to a useless degree. My second option was going back into the health field. But this time instead of a Biology degree and then later pursing a graduate education. I was thinking of nursing. I know nothing about nursing. I have a couple nurses in the family. All I know is that the schooling is incredibly stressful as well and that I’ll basically be back at square one studying all day with no real life to live. 

I want to point out a couple of side notes. I’m incredibly terrified of failure. If I pursue nursing, I know it’s very easy to get kicked out of the program if you even fail one course. At least in a ASN program. I’m not really sure how the BSN works. The only positive side I could see from nursing is the job security once the schooling is over. 

I also want to note that I’ve taken dozens of career tests and they’ve all said management careers. The only problem is again. There’s no job security in business. I’ve taken a personality test as well if that helps, my result was ESFP-T personality. 

Ultimately, I’m lost. I have till late March to officially decide on a major according to the school. Does anyone have advice? Please let me know. And thank you.",college
1871,1707600623.0,Is it better to drop out of animation school?," 

Hello! I'm an artist studying animation, I'm 19 years old, and I've started to consider dropping out of university.

I feel like I'm progressing very slowly, that learning online has helped me much more than university, and of course, I feel that the best way to get a job is through contacts rather than a university degree. Additionally, the economy at home is very difficult. I've thought about starting an online business and continuing to work on my artistic career (in fact, currently, my main income comes from art commissions). I've thought about creating multiple income streams such as investments, e-commerce, dropshipping, and merchandising for my brand, among other things.

But university not only consumes my time, I feel like I'm not learning anything valuable, and it's only holding me back from progressing in what I want to do. The only thing that interests me is the opportunity to go to Canada for their programs.

The problem with university is that it's an additional expense, so I need to use time to develop a stable source of income to pay for it. However, dedicating time to that means neglecting university, so it's a never-ending cycle. As they say, 'the more you take on, the less you achieve.'

Honestly, I feel that dropping out of university and taking the path of self-directed learning, networking, and developing my own sources of income sounds more promising.

Environmental studies major

Biology minor 
Military science minor
Philosophy minor

It's just that nearly every aspect of university is very overwhelming and I'm not sure how to get through it,"For some context, I'm autistic, ADHD, OCD, and depression. I am an online student living with my family, and family has been very tense lately. I am going to tutoring and I'm in the process of switching a therapist since the therapist I have now has been pushing boundaries.

Ever since I was a kid, I have always loved learning, but I've struggled with school environments and most classes. The only time I struggled less in college was when I was at a community college even though it was pretty lonely there. I was in the honor society, and the staff were amazing with my accommodations.

Now I'm a senior at university, and everything feels so much harder. I have had little support at the university I go to with my accommodations, and even through I'm taking 3 classes and I'm very passionate about my degree, I'm failing all of them.

There are a couple of things that happened to me recently that are very difficult to go through. The first being that I ended an unhealthy relationship (that's a very long story) and then one of my siblings that I'm very close to and is very supportive of me is moving really far for a job. 

Usually, I'm able to have some motivation for college, but this time I feel so defeated at the moment. My body is physically exhausted it feels like I haven't slept in days even though I sleep well, and I just feel very trapped. 

I would drop my classes and focus on my mental health. The problem is that all of my classes are declaration classes, and I believe that I can only drop so many classes, so this would most likely put me in an even worse place in the long run.

I have a few questions, and it's perfectly okay if someone answers one or all of them.

I had no classes of general physics for the whole time I studied in high school, so none of the basics stuck with me. I don't know the basic equations and don't have any of the basic thinking about physics problems. On top of that basic things like derivations, integrals or imaginary units are generally not taught on vocational high schools... (I really don't understand this)

Now there is a physics exam waiting for me next Tuesday, I just finished all of the materials which were given to us (presentations) and started fully practicing the equations (exam has two parts, written test and a oral part).

I don't know anything. It seems as if the equations just create themselves out of nothing. I can remember some of the theory, but no enough to apply it. I'm just lost and don't know what to do.

I'm full time doing 14 credits at a community college with plans to move to an instate university in the fall. I'm also doing another 4 credits at the university I want to attend. The class is an entry level class for electrical engineering.

Now to the problem, I'm 5 weeks in and this class has been awful. There's very minimal support for online students and the programs/concepts feel impossible to work with. Im sinking more time trying to get this 4 credit class than i am in my 5 credit physics class. I dont feel like im going to pass this class, moreover, I no longer feel like electrical is a good fit for me. This class has single handedly made me want to switch to a different branch of engineering. 
I want to withdraw. However, since it's the only class I'm taking at the university withdrawing means doing a semester withdrawal not just a class withdrawal. I'd still be doing 14 credits at the community college though. Worst of all, since I've decided to pursue a different branch of engineering, this class doesn't even count for my degree. Not even as an elective. So it's hard to justify spending the ridiculous amount of time this class is requiring when it essentially does nothing for me.

My main question is how bad would something like this affect financial aid and scholarships? Does having a semester withdrawal leave a terrible mark on my records? Outside of this issue I'm a 4.0 GPA student.
