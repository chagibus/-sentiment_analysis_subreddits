No. No no no no NO. As someone who's never earned much money because I made the spectacular decision to do what I love rather than what was lucrative, I'm finally in a position in my late 30s where I can actually save up to buy my dream car.

I get it if cars aren't important to you. I get it if you dislike the impact they have on the environment. I get it if you think sports cars are too expensive and a hassle. I get it if you see a forty something guy in a BMW M3 and assume he's compensating for something. But realize that automotive enthusiasm is a huge part of life for a lot of people, and can often be the biggest connection they have to family members or friends. 

As a car enthusiast, I look forward to increased electrification for a lower carbon footprint (and ridiculous torque for better acceleration). I accept that my budget will have to increase for a cool exotic car and decrease for other pursuits. It's worth it to me. Just like you might enjoy collecting stamps or having a closet full of nice clothes. It's also the first thing I talk about when I call my dad since he used to race cars and motorcycles in the 70s. We bond over cars and car news.

So the next time you see some guy with graying temples and a widow's peak driving a Ferrari, understand it might be the realization of a dream from childhood and try to, you know, not crap on that dream because it's not YOUR dream.",unpopularopinion

22,1595436915.0,"Most soldiers do not “fight for our rights” but rather fight for money, a career, or by compulsion from a draft.","The last war that was really about “our rights” was the civil war. Vietnam, WWI, II, Korea, Iraq and Afghanistan were really about global power dynamics. The soldiers that fought in these wars were not defending our rights, because our rights were not really being threatened.

Edit: this has been very interesting! A few points to address.

1.	A repeat theme is that WW2 was about American Rights. I politely disagree. The US entered only after being attacked and having its global position threatened. We had no choice. We had been declining for 5 years to enter the war. Now I guess it’s very true that many people joined the military after Pearl Harbor out of a sense of duty. But I just have a hard time seeing how it was a war for our rights. It was 100% a just war. But much of the justification was learned of only after the fact (most Americans didn’t know of the atrocities happening at concentration camps). 

2.	I never said there was anything wrong with joining for any reason other than patriotic duty. Join for whatever reason! I’m all for it. 

3.	This last point is very important. Many have said that without the military we wouldn’t have all these freedoms and rights so they therefore are fighting for our freedoms and rights by simply existing. This is an interesting notion. Because from my vantage point as an American, our military is the most powerful it has ever been, yet I have seen a steady derogation of American rights and freedoms throughout my entire life - from within. Being a super power does not somehow make our freedoms more secure. It’s actually the opposite IMO. The lack of a credible threat means our government can actually take away our rights without being checked. Look at China and Russia where it’s happening today and has happened for a while. Look at the last 12 years in the US (increased surveillance, Portland, police brutality etc).",unpopularopinion

25,1603376546.0,Math is awesome and the only reason people don't like it is that schools are shit at teaching it.,"In my opinion, math is the most beautiful of any ""traditional school subject,"" but the thing is schools are set up in a way that encourages teaching math as a bunch of formulas to memorize. And real math is seldom about memorization. I heard a friend describe math as ""the most useful game humanity has ever created"" and I have to say I agree with that. Math is like a game, it's a playground where you try to extrapolate truths from a set of rules. I will now spend the rest of this post explaining parts of math that are ignored in schools but are super interesting to me. My explanations don't use any technical math terms, but some of the videos linked will require some thinking.

1.) fractals: You might have heard of these before. Essentially, they're shapes that no matter how much you zoom into them, they're still rough. They never end up looking straight like a polygon or curved like a... curve. Some of my favorite are the [Mandelbrot set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPHbgHVxLYY), the [burning ship fractal](https://softologyblog.wordpress.com/2017/02/24/the-burning-ship-fractal/), and the [Sierpinski triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle). All of these are mathematical objects that have infinite complexity but are governed by relatively simple rules. The Sierpinski triangle is just putting triangles in triangles, and the other two use something called ""complex numbers"" which sounds very obtuse, but can actually be explained in under 30 minutes. But these fractals are even crazier: we often think of shapes in terms of how many dimensions they have. A line is 1D, a square is 2D, a cube is 3D, etc. But by a certain definition, fractals have a **fractional** dimension. So. for example, that Sierpinski triangle is about 1.585 dimensional. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4) for details

2.) Chaos theory: ever heard of the term ""the butterfly effect?"" This actually originated from a field of math called chaos theory, which studies systems that are sensitive to initial conditions. One example of a system they study is called the Lorentz Attractor, which is a simplification of the laws that govern the weather. What I love about the Lorentz attractor, is that when you ""solve"" it with a computer, it draws out paths that look like these [beautiful butterfly wings](https://imgur.com/a/0FS86tI). Let me make that clear: a couple of mathematical equations draw out something that looks as beautiful as that. There isn't human intervention in that drawing, that's just what the equations draw. There's also the [Chaos Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs) which uses probability to draw things. When you run the chaos game on certain initial conditions, you get this [absurdly accurate drawing of a fern](https://imgur.com/CizSVy1). Again, none of this is done by a human, all of these works of art are made entirely by solving mathematical equations. If you find that out and don't want to learn more, you're crazy

3.) Unexpected results: Let's take a second to play a [game of pool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEfHFsfGXjs). We'll knock one pool ball (ball one) into another (ball two), and count how many times they collide with each other or the wall. Then, let's change the mass of one of the balls and see how that affects the collision count. Tell me if you notice a pattern

    Mass of ball 1    Mass of ball 2      Collision #
    1kg               1kg                 3
    100kg             1kg                 31
    10000kg           1kg                 314
    1000000kg         1kg                 3141
    100000000kg       1kg                 31415
    10000000000kg     1kg                 314159
    1000000000000kg   1kg                 3141592

Now you might not notice it, because it's not something you'd expect, but when you increase the mass by 100x, the collision count adds **another digit of pi**. Again, hitting some balls against each other writes out **the digits of pi**. I find that crazy. Pi is normally about circles: I don't see a circle. And pi is counting something. When was the last time you saw it do that? In the words of the legendary math educator Grant Sanderson ""If you have a **soul** you need to know why!""

I could name more instances of math being beautiful, but I think these three should be sufficient for a silly Reddit post. However, even if I didn't completely change your view of math, I hope you understand why people like me love it.

Edit: I just looked at this post on my phone. God that chart looks horrible. Why can't code blocks look consistent on all devices?

Edit 2: I'm not saying that teachers who teach math don't try, I just think it's inherently incredibly difficult for 1 person to teach 50+ kids math every day.

Edit 3: I'm aware of dyscalculia. The use of ""only"" in the title was a bit of an exaggeration, however, I do feel like for the vast majority of people they simply aren't taught in a way that suits them.",unpopularopinion

If my kid wants to play single-player games, even if they have gores, horrors, sex scenes. I don’t mind letting them play these games because I trust my ability to guide them and to point out and explain any potentially problematic areas.

But with social media, things are totally different. While Instagram and Facebook, Snapchat still let you just engage with your friends, many others just open up to the public and anyone can engage. Things like Discord, Twitter, and pretty much everything comments section under an online video and online game voice lobbies. Knowing that behind those aren’t codes and pixels but real

On the other hand, with colder climates, it's really easy to cool yourself down; get under a warm blanket, get a hot drink and just **vibe** there I guess. It's really comforting too, probably one of the best feelings ever.

Though this doesn't really make sense if you're outdoors and not inside, it's technically inside I'm talking about. Being outside is a whole different story, though it's technically the same answer on that side in my opinion.

The lady at the counter was very nice, but said that number means nothing to her or her computer. She says she needs more information. I tell her the make and we kind of come up something similar that will (probably) work. But... it’s not in stock and they are moving their warehouse, so two weeks minimum. I ask for suggestions, and she gives the name of three other places in town. 

I call those places. The first two are total assholes to me. Very condescending, and telling me I need the model number. Again, the four digit code means nothing to them.

Being a former smoker, I recognize the addiction and subsequent irritability of coffee drinkers and it bugs me to no end that caffeine gets glossed over as an addictive substance, or even fucking celebrated to some extent.  Those people who brag about needing 5 expresso shots (sorry, esssspresso) a day need an intervention, not a nod of approval.  Seriously, all you coffee drinkers are the biggest group of fucking enablers I've ever seen.

I hate the sleepy look in peoples' eyes as they grasp their cup of stimulant that they wouldn't need had they never started drinking it in the first place.

There's an entire fucking cupboard in my kitchen dedicated to stupid coffee mugs and their dumb sayings staring back at me despite living in a household where only one person drinks coffee.  Why?  And the dishes.  Since nearly every person drinks coffee, inevitably us non-coffee drinkers are going to have to clean up after your morning fix.

64,1600010644.0,A lot of the television shows using fully adult actors in a high school setting could easily change their plot to revolve around a college setting instead of the weird fixation television has on displaying the sex lives of high schoolers,"I think a good example of this is the show Riverdale. If you don’t know, it’s a show using the characters of Archie comics in a teen murder drama ish show. In that show their lives are about whatever big mystery is going on, their relationships, and their friends. The characters in the show are high-school age (16 I believe) but a majority of the cast are actors in their mid-twenties (one actor is almost 29). 

In the show, or as much as I’ve seen, being an actual high school student occupies very little of the character’s lives and the aspects of high school we do see the characters participate it could more or less be translated into a college setting. So why even make them high school students? I know to reach a youth audience and whatever but seeing how a lot of this shows content displays varied sexual relationships between characters, I feel like it’s a bit weird seeing all these high school age relationships so graphically being acted by much older people. 

And I’m realizing now that Riverdale isn’t the *best* example (a plot point of season 1 is an inappropriate teacher student relationship) but there are a lot of shows like this out. I think Hollywood should stop fetishizing high school sexual relationships when they really don’t have to. My issue with it isn’t so much the displays of sex, more that the show creators are leaning so heavily into all the displays of sex of people who are **supposed** to be minors. Gives a weird voyeurism vibe. If the plot allows, just make the setting college, it would even make more sense with the plots sometimes.

TLDR: I have no issue with sex being a plot point in teen-oriented television but the mentality of “We have 27 year olds playing 16 year olds so let’s shoot this soft core porn scene because we can 😎” is very problematic and approaching borderline pedophilic

To read the exact same story, but from a different perspective. I imagine this would be great for the Harry Potter books, as there was so much depth shown in certain characters that it's a shame we only got to read it from Harry's perspective. This idea of ""equals"" would also allow readers to see depth and traits in a character they may not have seen before just by reading the main character's perspective.

69,1610612613.0,"Not learning (or worse, not teaching your kids) to swim is one of the absolute stupidest things you could do","Swimming is like walking, but for water. It's part of the few basic means of movement we, humans, have at our disposal, along with running, crawling and climbing. Not knowing how to swim puts you at a HUGE disadvantage, as you pretty much can't avoid water. Any mildly interesting / fun activity might turn into a potentially lethal one, should you not know how to swim. Going fishing? Better not fall into the water... It's like permadeath for video games: instead of ending up wet, and maybe slightly (or very) cold, you just friggin' die if you fall into deep water. I know, swimmers can drown too, but if you can't swim, you're guaranteed to have to be rescued.

On another note, it's so weird to see healthy people being incapable of performing the most basic human activities: I've seen grown men injure themselves trying to climb over a 3 feet fence (not drunk), women twisting their ankles and tearing tendons when running towards a bus stop, etc. Now, I'm not saying that everybody needs to be a world-class climber like Adam Ondra or swimmer, like Michael Phelps. But learning how to... I don't know, not die when navigating anything but flat terrain seems like it should be part of being a grown human.

Edit: Jesus Christ this blew up... Most of the negative responses are about not having access to swimming facilities (either due to lack of money / lack of said facilities or both). I'm obviously not suggesting someone shouldn't eat for 3 months to pay for swimming lessons or move to an area just to learn. 

But ""I'm scared of water / I've had a bad experience"" are not valid excuses, all the more, they're reasons to push your boundaries and defeat said fear. It's like saying ""I've had my heart broken in high school, I will NEVER date again"". Sure, you can avoid both water and dating, but is it worth it?

73,1604355596.0,Dear Parents Whose Adult Children Don't Talk To Them - It's Always Your Fault.,"You were the adult when they were a child. If their first instinct, as soon as they get out from under your thumb, is to completely ignore you forever, you need to own the fact that you messed up as a parent at several, consistent, points along the road throughout your child's upbringing. They hate you for a good reason, and they're probably better off without you in their lives.

There are a number of forms of abuse that range from over-parenting, to neglect, over-discipline to straight up negative enabling behavior.

I have friends who don't talk to their parents because the strictness was so suffocating, and friends who don't talk to their parents because they were lazy bums who never took an interest in their child's life. There are tons of other reasons kids abandon relationships with their folks, but the one thing that stays true through all of these experiences for me is that it's always the parents fault.

This is mostly about relationships that end as soon as the kid leaves the house, not necessarily relationships that break down during adulthood, although the same reasoning could be applied in a lot of these cases too.

EDIT:  
To the people in the comments defending parents and blaming the kids: If you're a kid defending your parents then congratulations on having parents who treated you fairly and cared for you I'm sincerely happy for you (everyone didn't get the same life you did), if you're a parent defending yourself then just own up to the fact that you messed up and move on with your life, try to be happy and leave your kids alone because they've cut you out for very good reasons and they're better off without you.",unpopularopinion

If you read through these articles, you will find that the theme is *men bad* because they refuse to play the social role written for them. It's mostly from the perspective of how this creates problems for women in the long run, but still that's the core of it.

Contrary to what these journalists would have you believe, I think these young men are acting completely rationally when opting out of this life script. There just aren't enough incentives to play this role, it is too risky and too exhausting, and I can personally see how one would derive way more satisfaction from hanging out with ones mates, playing video games, or being in a band. Young men don't owe society anything. We should just live and let live, and let people enjoy their lives in the way they want to, instead of judging them.

The median household income in 1998 was $38,885. The most recent year with full data available is 2017, so adjusting for inflation as of that year gives a median income of $58,487. The Bureau of Census reports that the actual median 2017 income was $59,000 – higher than the adjusted figure, but not by very much, and certainly nowhere near the percentage that prices have outpaced inflation.

This did not happen by accident - this happened because of greed. CEO salary and shareholder profits have outstripped wages and cost of living by a factor of between 3 and 8 depending on the source you read. 

Millennials TRULY have it harder than our parents did.

•	We cannot afford to ""put ourselves through school"" working a part time job - they could. 

•	We cannot afford to have one parent stay at home - they could. 

•	We cannot afford to buy a house on a single income - they could. 

And yet, Boomers have the audacity to tell us that we need to just work harder, pull ourselves up by our boot straps. That we're lazy and entitled. 

No, we're not. The data shows that Millennials work just as hard as our parents generation, but we struggle more. 

For years now, when Boomers have told us, ""you're lazy and entitled"" and we need to ""just work harder"", we've tried to explain this to them - and they don't listen. 

We learned that there's no point in trying to convince them - nothing will change their mind. So now we just say, ""OK boomer"".

96,1597668902.0,"Everyone SHOULD feel unsafe and alert when walking the streets at night. It's not oppression, it's a necessary survival instinct.","Mentally twisted, ill, fucked up people will always exist, and both women and men need to have the appropriate psychological and physiological response to prepare for such a threat, particularly when we are alone and vulnerable in the dark. Striving for a world where women (or more generally, **everyone**) can roam freely at night is unrealistic.

I regularly hear that women should not have to feel unsafe walking alone at night, as a result of the patriarchy and men preying on vulnerable women. Apparently it's a common assumption that men do not feel this pressure whatsoever, which is entirely bullshit. Everyone **should** feel this way when walking alone at night. Anything can happen to anyone.

I'm a white male and have been assaulted walking home from work last year, when a group of drunk men asked me to have a drink with them, I declined and they yelled slurs at me and threw empty glass bottles at me. One of my male school friends, who is a bodybuilder, was stabbed walking late at night.

We *all* feel that way because we need to be psychologically and physiologically prepared to flee a threat. Sketchy, fucked up people will always exist, unfortunately. They prey on vulnerable targets, and night time is the peak for these twisted fucks as it is isolated and dark, and when most are drunk.

If we hypothetically reach a state where people can feel entirely safe walking alone at night, they are more vulnerable and unsuspecting to possible attacks. We need to be alert. It's our natural response to trying to stay the fuck alive.

Edit: I probably used 'unsafe' and 'alert' interchangeably when they have different meanings. This is poor phrasing on my behalf, what I mean is that we should be alert. We shouldn't feel unsafe at all times, but rather we should recognise that the environment can be unsafe. ",unpopularopinion
97,1580911264.0,Young men are dropping out of society because it's abundantly clear nobody gives a shit about them,"The majority of homeless people are men. The majority of suicide deaths are men. Young men graduate college less than young women. Young women are out-earning young men. Single women are more likely to own a home than single men. There are gross discrepancies in the amount of government aid available to men and that available to women.

Yet I've never seen women marching to end male homelessness. I've never heard a radio ad about raising money for prostate cancer. I've never seen a commercial asking men if maybe it's time to give college a second chance. Literally, nobody cares if you live or die. Nobody cares if you're educated or fulfilled. Nobody cares about you.

And you will be openly mocked, belittled, and humiliated if you don't fit into the predefined social mold that exists for men. Homeless? Fuck off. Small dick? Haha. Suicidal? Ew.

Why bother trying to be part of society that at best ignores you, and at worst is openly antagonistic towards you? I've seen so many articles like this: ""Why are young men dropping out? It must be because educated women scare them."" They always come to the same, obtuse, and illogical conclusions. ""Men are just stupid/lazy/useless/onerous in some way, I guess. Women are better anyways.""

Young men are dropping out because they are treated by society like actual, literal disposable objects. That's the real reason.

Edit: To everyone asking me in the comments why women should be responsible for helping men, this is the reason: Feminism by its literal definition is about fostering gender equality. If men are disproportionately negatively affected by things like homelessness, violence, a lack of education, and presumptions of criminality, then these are inherently feminist issues.

And its true. Women have support systems for their depression, they have systems in place and people are much more prone to be sympathetic to women and don't want to see a woman suffering, people want to help and show they are not alone.


But for men we are alone, partially because of the traditional view that men cannot show weakness, but the biggest reason is no one cares. People don't just not care they distance themselves from you. Men and women will just walk away or show a miniscule amount of compassion. Men know that expressing our depression or darker thoughts is a terrible idea because it will make matters worse, not better. 


There is this modern trend that traditional gender roles cause men not to talk about this, I think that's a small component of the reason, but its because most of us know if we come forward with our issues, the people around us and society at large will largely shun us. Therefore we bottle it in and deal with it by ourselves, not because we are afraid of not looking like ""real men"" but because we know we are alone in this struggle and if we open up we will lose so, so much.",unpopularopinion

105,1584176014.0,Disney is overrated and people are brainwashed into loving it more than they should.,"There is no legitimate reason why best animated film is going to Disney every single year, almost without fail, since the award was invented in 2001. 2017 is probably the best example for this. The two greatest animated films that year were Loving Vincent and the Breadwinner. Loving Vincent was revolutionary in terms of medium, having each frame be a full oil painting. It also told a beautiful story and the cinematography was magnificent. Breadwinner was also a magnificent story about a Middle Eastern girl searching for her father. Either of these films should have won best animated picture, but they didn't. They lost to Coco. Don't get me wrong, Coco was good, almost great even. But it was nowhere near as revolutionary nor as important a story as Loving Vincent or the Breadwinner. Coco won simply because it was Disney Pixar. The only reason Disney is winning every year is because they are overrated and super well known, whereas these other films are indie films. But the best picture shouldn't go to a film because of the company that produces it, but rather because of the quality and importance of the films itself. Indie films and 2d animated films continually get stumped by Disney for best animated picture. In fact, only once did a 2d film win, and only once did a foreighn film win, and that one time for both of those was when Spirited Away won in 2002. Never again has a 2d or foreign film won, and never has an indie film won. 

Disneyland is a fucking scam. It's a 1984 community that feels so eerily unsettling and inhuman. They brainwash people with their slogans like ""happiest place on earth"" and they cover up anything bad from their audience. Not to mention the corporate greed, and the continuous raising of prices for tickets. Disney also own half of Anaheim city, and most of the nearby hotels and motels are secretly owned by Disney. Some goes for the nearby gas stations, diners, etc. Disney pretty much runs the city of Anaheim in secrecy, and the Anaheim government is perfectly fine with that because they get big paychecks out if it. Disneyland isn't even as great as everyone says it is. The only reasons people go so much is because people are sad, and where better to go than what is advertised as the ""happiest place on earth""? People take their kids there because they think that their kids have to go to Disneyland at least once to have a good quality childhood. People I know seem to go to Disneyland often simply to show how fucking rich and well off they are. They're using Disneyland as a way to express their higher class, not as a way to actually enjoy themselves. Walt Disney imagined a Utopia, but it seems to me that he got a Dystopia instead. He wanted to use his money for good, for human progress in technology, but instead the company hoards it and just uses the money to get even more money. Imagine the good charity that the company could do with their money. That is what Walt wanted. He wanted money for the people, not for the corporation.

Working at Disney is terrible. If you work in animation, any drawing you produce at the time, whether on duty or not, are the property of Disney. This prevents people from being able to do freelance or to work for other companies at the same time. (This also means that theres vaults of cartoon porn that Disney owns because the artists draw shit like that for shits and giggles). If you work at Disneyland, they treat you like shit and they don't pay well either. But hey, you get free tickets, so it's all good (sarcasm). Disney oppresses their employees and they get away with it all the time because they have big money. 

Disney is continuously fighting their competition until they win, and they almost alwats win. And by competition, I don't mean enemies, but allies too. This can be seen in the Sony argument where Disney continually demands more and more, until smaller companies have to give in because they know that they can't make it opposing such a powerful entity. This is what happened with Spiderman, as Disney got greedy and started demanding more profits and Sony said no, so Disney broke off their deal until Sony finally gave in because they'd make even less money if they cut ties with Disney all together than if they gave them most of the profits for Spiderman. This bullshit has been pulled off so many times by Disney.

Disney is taking over the film industry and the marketing industry and it pisses me off so much that almost everyone is just ok with that. Disney also keeps producing films that stump smaller films in awards because the game is rigged in favor of bigger entities. Movies like Frozen, Brave, the Incredibles, etc are only popular because of the company that is making them, not because of the quality of the films itself. People expect a Disney film to be good, and oftentimes people's opinions will be biased based on what they go in expecting. People need to support smaller companies and indie companies more often than they do, before there aren't any left to support.",unpopularopinion

I shouldn’t be expected to respect someone’s religion/lifestyle when they go around claiming they can cast spells, control the weather, make potions and hang out with spirits from other dimensions. Edit to add that yes, this goes for Christianity, Islam and any other religion.

I also shouldn’t be expected to respect people who don’t “identify as human species” ... excuse me? I don’t even have an argument for this but if you think that you can identify as a whole different species you need therapy.

I understand that reading about your horoscope can be fun, stars are pretty and if you wanna read about it or just enjoy the zodiac sign aesthetic that’s more than fine, BUT if you start justifying your shitty behavior because you’re x sign, you’re just trashy.

Sex positivity is fine and healthy but there’s no need to be openly doing your kinky stuff in public, if you want to walk your partner on a leash, that’s cool, but the other people at the dog park are not consenting to be a part of it, it’s not kinkshaming, but there’s places for that kind of stuff.

we can always have more babies while remembering any we've lost, which hopefully will be zero. i just dont think i could leave this earth with so so much unfinished business and leave behind a child i'd never meet and a husband that needs me as much as i need him. i dont want to do it. so this is my choice.


i believe im putting my baby first in this situation. i dont think it should even be a question if i would give my life in order to save my child's. it's a yes no doubt. but that is the child i know that isnt a blank canvas. theyre an actual person who's (self) aware, at least more than a baby. but i would also prefer to be alive for my children to grow up how they deserve, with loving parents who only want the best for them. i want to give them the best life i can offer, we both do. but we both need to be there to do it, at the very least, in the beginning.",unpopularopinion
120,1551963923.0,In a lot of children's shows like Peppa Pig the fathers are consistently portrayed as bumbling idiots and the mothers as awesome heroines saving the day and it sends a very wrong message to little kids,"Like in virtually every show aimed towards little kids, the girls are heroic, the boys foolish. The girls save the day. I don't mind that the girls save the day, every once in a while, but for them to *always* do it and the male characters to *always* lag behind is a pity. Like there's Barbie movies too in which Barbie saves the day and is portrayed as competent and heroic, whereas Ken is a borderline idiot who kisses the ground she walks on and always gets in trouble. A lot of kids shows are like this. The father figures are weak, the mother figures all-knowing. 

In Peppa Pig, specifically, the father of Peppa is an engineer. He has blue prints lying around the house and everything, has an office, works hard, is a pillar of the community, and yet he's constantly made fun of and used as the butt of jokes because he's a bit fat. It's kinda lame and gives a terrible example. Meanwhile ""Mommy Pig"" is awesome and pretty much flawless. The whole thing is pretty insidious.

From an early age it sends a message of girls being empowered, but how about the little boys? Like sure there's still superhero movies but those are aimed at a little older audience, plus all those superheroes are usually genetically mutated in some way and unrealistically handsome, so few kids would identify with them.",unpopularopinion
121,1596153089.0,Pharmacists should be REQUIRED to wear capes at work.,"As a pharmacist, I am so sick and tired of pretending to be a doctor. Its so annoying how everyone in my profession has this doctor imposter syndrome. It even influences the way we dress.

Why on earth do we wear labcoats? Who’s idea was this? What are we protecting our underclothes from exactly?

Its time we start to distinguish ourselves from other medical professions. Scrubs are for nurses. Labcoats are for doctors (and actual lab people).

It should be a requirement for pharmacists to wear capes to distinguish ourselves from others. There is no practical reason for wearing capes, I’ll admit, but neither is there a practical reason to wear a labcoat.

Additionally, I’m tired of being summoned to help a customer (probably with something incredibly stupid, obvious, or boring) without making a grander entrance. If I had a cape, I could briskly walk towards the costomer and come to a quick stop and allow the cape to flow up and consume me a little before I begin to speak.

I would want to do the cliche vampire reveal thing using one arm to hold half the cape in front of me and then toss it asside, but that would be very unprofessional.

Additional comments:
1) Yes, I am technically a doctor because I have a doctorate. You know what I meant though.
2) A lot of people doubting I am a pharmacist. I am indeed a pharmacist, but I was not put on this earth to argue with internet strangers so, idrc

1. You’re on a first date from tinder, you ask her for a second date. But she says that she’d rather be friends. You can simply (and politely) decline her offer for friendship and part ways amicably.

2. You have a prior acquaintance with a woman (coworker for example) and ask her out for a drink. She prefixes this by saying “as friends, right?”, you can (again politely state) that this was a romantic offer and to avoid complicating the situation you can retract the offer. 

The only situation in which you may want to continue a friendship with a woman (who you may have a romantic interest in) would be if you were friends prior. But it’s on you to move on from your romantic afflictions and continue the friendship with no ambition for anything else.

If you ask me, it’s not enough that it’s prohibited in certain public spaces (a rule that is often not respected by smokers anyway). Since smoking has no medical use (or at least not any that have scientific backing), combined with its high potential for abuse and addiction, it needs to be treated with the severity it deserves.

And don’t give me that bullshit of “smoking doesn’t hurt anybody but the smoker, so piss off”, because second hand smoke definitely exists and can even cause lung cancer in non smokers.

In a boxing match, I win as I am much stronger. They would be unable to run away as I am much faster. Neither of these are viable options. Thus I only see two options in which they emerge the victor.

The first way would be for them to choke me out. They would need to avoid my mouth and paws , but if they were able to get behind me due to my poor eyesight (I know we have good eyesight but I had another guy try to fight me last year and he tried poking my eyes out while we fought and it hasn't really been the same since, absolutely mauled that guy tho lol). I would have to have a very thin neck and not think of retaliating against this at all, even though I can kill him with a single swipe.

The second way would be for them to blind me. In this scenario they would need to be fully prepared to sacrifice an arm, a leg, their testicles, two eyes, a nose, half an ear, their scalp, a kidney, and their lungs, and while I am attacking them, they would use sticks or fingers to try to blind me. I am aware that I have small eyes, however, if they really concentrated while I was having a nice liver breakfast, I believe they might be able to hit their target.

144,1588503590.0,Pixar fucked up the first 10 minutes of UP.,"There. I said it. It's been bugging me for 11 years. People keep going on and on about those first ten minutes like they are the pinnacle of animation. But in my mind, I think Pixar basically botched what *could've been* one of the actual greatest animated moments. I feel like those 10 minutes were always meant to be shown in the *middle* of the film. Almost as if they decided to make that sequence the opening as an afterthought.   


Throughout the first half of the film, Carl doesn't really open up to Russell; and we don't really know why he's so keen to get to Paradise Falls or why he cares so much about a stupid house (except we do know since we watched the opening). Eventually, we get a scene where Carl alone enters the broken house and takes out an old photo album, basically giving us another mini-version of the first ten minutes. I'm convinced that in an earlier draft of the script, the opening 10 minutes where intended to be shown during this scene. And I believe that if it had played out like that, the moment would've been 10 times more powerful than it is in the final film. Because then everything would click, suddenly we would understand why this stubborn old man behaved the way he did. The buildup would make that emotional punch much stronger.  


But the way the film is now; we go into the movie seeing a montage about a character we are yet to  care about; and throughout the entire film we know everything about Carl's life and motivations, making his reserved and introverted character pointless since we already understand.

The reason as to why it is messed up  is because you should be a good person based on your own moral code, not religion. What if that religion never existed? What would you do if you all of a sudden didn't like religion anymore? What would you do then? Would you go, and kill people? Would rob banks? Would you do all the horrible things you wanted to do previously?

Those who think this way usually don't even know or care for the reason *why* they shouldn't do horrible things. They only seem to not do awful things only because they think that something bad will happen to them, based upon their religious belief.

*Now to clarify, this isn't to say that I hate people who believe in religion, or think all people who use religion in their life think this way (although, I do personally despise religion, as it has caused a lot of trouble in my life).

Same goes for women who do the same (like Danielle and Mohammed) though they aren’t shown as often.

152,1600881035.0,Paparazzis should be able to get charged for harassment and the invasion of privacy by celebrities.,"There is nothing okay about photographing people in public without consent, the same should apply for celebrities.


Imagine, you have something that puts you in the public eye a lot, whether it’s your job or something to do with being part of a famous family. And one day you’re going for a walk in the park when suddenly someone starts following you and taking pictures of you before you can even make direct eye contact with them, just snapping photos of you like you’re some kind of landmark. What will they do with those photos? Who knows? Not like it’s any of your business, right?


Let’s put it in a different perspective. What if you aren’t a celebrity, you’re just some average joe on your way home. Would it be ok for someone to yell “hey! Smile! Ooh turn your head this way for me!” Whilst they start following and photographing you? Of course not, that’s pretty much the definition of an invasion of privacy. So why is it ok to do it to a celebrity? And how well known do you have to be for them to get away with it?


I genuinely hate the “oh well it’s just one of the side effects to being famous” answer. No job or occupation should make it okay for people to snap photos of you whilst in public and doing stuff outside work.


Even at movie premieres, the places paparazzis are actually expected to be at, they take it too far by practically chasing them around whilst they try to leave the theatres.

Also half the time it’s done without the person even knowing that they’re being photographed, such as those annoying articles nobody even cares about where they talk about what they saw Demi Lovato have at Starbucks the other day. Nobody should have permission to make someone’s personal life public to everyone when they’re just doing the same thing as everyone else. If I started following the guy who owns my local KFC and started posting pictures of them and writing articles about what they do in their free time on Facebook then I’d probably get called a stalker and get sued for harassment. But it’s fine if said person happens to be famous?

Hell, Princess Diana was indirectly killed by paparazzis because she got in a car crash whilst trying to get away from the swarm of people chasing her! Someone literally died because they were so focused on escaping a group of paid stalkers that their car ended up crashing.

Paparazzis are the literal scum of the earth, the bottom of the food chain. Only able to survive by latching onto people with more money so that they can document the stuff that should be private. They’re like secret spies, except, instead of finding out about the enemy’s secret weapons projects, they’re filming someone’s daily life as if they’re one of the animals on a BBC documentary.

Another thing that I hate is when they make it sound like the celebrity is totally in on it and is intentionally attracting paparazzis. For example: when a celebrity is pregnant they say something like “[insert name here] shows off growing baby bump during walk in [insert location]!” As if they’re getting up on a stage and telling everyone when actually they were just walking around whilst pregnant. A pregnant woman isn’t “showing off” her belly just because you can see it, she’s just walking around and *surprise surprise!* it’s not really easy to hide your belly when it’s growing a mini person inside it.


The whole thing about paparazzis and reporters just make my blood boil, whether it’s their annoying personality or their complete lack of respect for someone’s privacy.",unpopularopinion

18 is still a kid. Even up to 22 you are still pretty much the same as when you're in high school. The ones who appear more mature are just faking it til they make it, and by the time they ""make it"" everyone else has caught up developmentally.   


**The amount of times I've managed to resolve issues in work/study for younger adults just because I'm old enough to not be intimidated by dick-swinging boomers is fucking ridiculous.**

Being paid on time and for all hours worked and not missing lunch breaks  
Not getting in huge trouble for tiny mistakes (E.g. Being late for work by 5 minutes ONCE)  
Not having and identification document in time for university  
Not knowing rates for mechanics or other services  
Having ideas or input stolen  
Misunderstanding taxation and financial documents and contracts  
Being a waiter and the food taking too long so you have to deal with the piece of shit karen  
And much fucking more I'm sure a lot of you have dealt with.

The amount of times I've seen people 40+ absolutely ruin young adults careers and studies is beyond ridiculous. These people are insanely young. It's not ok for you to try and kick them out of uni because they didn't have one or two documents in order in their first semester out of high school (Attempted on 8 people I know, 7 of which got out of it because they contacted me). It's not ok to attempt to fail a girl out of uni because she missed a compulsory class for health reasons, but doesn't understand the how to navigate the bureaucracy  of university administration and contact methods.

**Your goal should be to help and guide young adults in any way possible.**

168,1567011992.0,I'm a guy and I wish I could be pregnant,"I think pregnancy is wonderful. I know it's not all lollipops and rainbows. I supported my wife every single day through her pregnancy and I helped her through the nausea, the body aches, and the terrible pain of giving birth. I know there are risks and complications and it's not something everyone wants to do. I wish I could do it, though.


My wife and I agreed we wanted a baby as soon as we had a house. Thankfully, she was able to become pregnant (I really feel for the women who can't have babies and wish they could) and we now have a toddler who is an absolute joy.


She loved being pregnant. Every day we talked about the baby growing in her womb that we couldn't wait to meet. I kissed her belly hundreds of times. And I fell in love with her all over again every time I looked at her. Her hand was pretty much glued to her belly, always rubbing it and humming a song. The bond that is formed between the mother and child is simply beautiful.


The hardest part about it is that I'll never be able to realize this wish and I never had a choice in the matter. Women can choose (in most cases) whether or not they want to become pregnant. And I don't know how the logistics of it all would work, anyway. Maybe if we lived in a world where both men and women were built with the capability to have babies, kind of like seahorses. I know it's not realistic, but if it were possible to give me a uterus transplant I'd consider it. I would go through considerable pain and effort if it meant I could get pregnant.


Every guy I've ever told has either looked at me like I'm insane or just straight-up laughed at me. Women I've told seem to understand, but nobody really takes it seriously except for my wife. She knows it's not a joke and that it's an actual dream of mine. Any guys out there agree with me?


Edit: Some people are rightfully pointing out that my wife's pregnancy went smoothly and that we are very fortunate. I do not disagree. However, I disagree that I have an idealized view of pregnancy. Just because things went well for her does not mean they would for me and does not mean they go well for others, but it also does not invalidate my feelings. As I stated above, I am well-informed of the risks that come with pregnancy.

They’re almost identical to the Transformers movies, just with slightly better creative vision. 

No, I’m not the arbiter on what films are trash and what films are good, or anything, but the critics load up RT with fresh scores for every Marvel film with dozens of complaints about the films and just end up designating it “4 Stars” or “fresh” because “it’s fun, I guess” or “it’ll work for the audience it’s meant for”. These films are graded on a massive curve and the only reason people like them is because it’s in the zeitgeist to. 

Of all the franchises and stories that have become extremely successful across the decades, Marvel is the one that earned that success the least.

179,1612017267.0,It’s selfish to continue a pregnancy if the baby is so sick that the doctors recommend termination.,"There was a news story a couple years ago where a very prominantent pro-birther in my area learned that her baby’s brain didn’t develop and her doctor recommended termination. The news story was basically “How dare a medical professional say such a thing; my baby is perfect to me.” A lot of people called her a “hero” for continuing the pregnancy and giving birth. The baby died before her first birthday. 

If doctors are recommending termination, nature has decided the baby isn’t going to make it. Generally speaking, there are two instances where the parents decide to continue the pregnancy anyway. Either a) the parents are in total denial about the situation and are pretending it isn’t happening or b) the parents are putting their ideology/religious beliefs first. It is truly sad and horrible when babies die in this way, no one should ever have to go through this, but it is delaying the inevitable and forcing your child to needlessly suffer is cruel and selfish. 

Obviously everyone has the right to make this decision for themselves and their children but I do think you’re a bad person if you put your own beliefs above your children. I think the woman in the news story is a bad mom who doesn't care about her kids.",unpopularopinion

Very often they just want you to read biased views until you have the same opinion as them. But they fail to understand that it’s not because you are uneducated, as they’re suggesting, but because you have looked at the facts and come to a different conclusion.

ProLife, ProChoice, whatever, more power to you. I’m just specifically saying if you ARE ProLife, you have to object in vitro fertilization.

IVF clinics trash more fertilized eggs a year than abortion clinics. The entire process is them fertilizing a certain amount of eggs, transplanting the ones least likely to have genetic problems into the mother, and tossing the rest and/or freezing them and then tossing them later if the parents decide not to try again. If you believe life begins at conception, i.e. fertilization, then any embryo that does not get implanted is murdered the same way an aborted embryo is murdered.

The only reason people don’t make a huge deal out of it like they do with Planned Parenthood or other family planning clinics is because it’s EXPENSIVE. It’s for upper middle class and above. Meanwhile, abortion is often seen as a lower class problem.

After half a week I go up and ask her out but she goes ""I really liked you when we first met but not anymore"" then i ask what stopped her from asking me out and says ""Guys should be the ones asking us out"". We still close friends but yeah.

183,1590229056.0,Just because we are live in Africa doesn’t mean we don’t have basic amenities,"Hey guys, newbie here

I’m African and I’ve realized that whenever I start talking to someone online and I mention that I do in fact live in Africa, the entire conversation goes sideways and then it becomes “how do you have internet?” “ do you see lions frequently?” And other weird questions like that. And I’m not the only one who gets questions like that. 

My mum went to the USA a couple years back for an internship at a Montessori school. She still keeps in touch with one of the teachers there via email and Facebook. But last week when they were talking about ideas for online school during this pandemic, the lady still asked if there was access to electricity and internet in our community. My mum was quite irritated and she had to explain that yes, we have internet access in our homes and business and that’s how we’re able to use social media and email. 

I understand that the media in these places depicts Africa as a place where people wear leaves and hides and sleep in huts but don’t all continents have villages and rural areas?

Not everyone has to climb palm tree to get internet access and no, I have never seen a lion or a giraffe outside the zoo. In fact, i think the ‘wildest’ animal I’ve seen outside the zoo is a garden snake. 

Thank you. 
P.S. I’m new to reddit so please don’t judge me too harshly. Cheers:)

P.S: A lot of people have been asking why I say I’m from Africa instead of specifying where exactly. When I say Lagos, Nigeria, they always ask “where is that?” Then I say Africa and the questions follow.

P.P.S: there are a lot of things I’d like to clarify 

1. None of said conversation happened on Reddit, or during quarantine 
2. Lagos is not the capital of Nigeria 
3. If you’re saying a larger percentage of people in Africa don’t have internet access, you are correct. But if you are chatting with people over the internet then is it too much to assume that they aren’t part of that percentage?
4. It has come to my notice that this sub isn’t the perfect place for this post. No need to bite my head off, I shall crosspost 
5. For all you peaches who keep yelling “But Africa is POOR!!!” In the comments, no one said it wasn’t besides, it is rude to assume that the person on the other end of the phone or whatever is poor simply because they’re African and no decent human being should do that

Most people are just trying to get stoned but don’t feel comfortable enough to admit it, so they blame it on a health reason.

My ex was one of these people. She cared deeply about fixing social issues and because of that she felt it was fine to steamroll everyone she knew and cared about because their discomfort was worth the change she was pushing. To an extent, I even agree with that. She was way too hypocritical though. Eventually she became dead to my feelings. If she hurt me, I did something to deserve it, or I was overreacting out of fragility and needed to ""get a grip"". She was never willing to admit wrong, and my views were always tainted because I was a guy.


I spent way too long in that relationship hating myself because I respected her efforts for change. It wasn't until I sought therapy that I realized how hurtful she was being.

217,1597301479.0,It's okay to break up with someone because of their mental health issues.,"I just want to preface this post and say I have nothing against anyone who is working through mental health issues or am I trying to offend them. You have your own battles to fight and that's okay. 

I've noticed that recently there have been a lot of social media posts about dating people with mental health issues (eg. post like ""dating someone who understands ur mental health is soo important. there's humans who will make u feel terrible for things u can't or don't know how to control yet""). I feel that posts like this don't understand the impact it can have on the other person in the relationship. 

As someone who has been in a two-year relationship where I was the emotional dumpster for my former partner, I felt insanely guilty for even wanting to break up with them because I couldn't continue to support them in their mental health journey. My former partner would often blame for me not being understanding or patient enough. They snapped at me on multiple occasions when I was talking about my day and my work team and how fun my day at work was because it made them feel more depressed that their work team wasn't as close. Later in the relationship, I had learnt to only ask about how their day went but never share my own, in fear of not being supportive of their mental health. 

Now I know that not everyone with mental health issues will be like my former partner, but posts on social media perpetuate the stigma that YOU'RE the unempathetic/uncaring/non-supportive one if you can't understand your partner's mental health. 

It's not true. You're not a bad person for wanting to break up with them. It's okay to break up with your partner if they're being toxic. Being with someone who is going through mental health issues is draining and it's okay to break up with your partner if their mental health is too much for you. It's okay to not be an emotional dumpster for your partner. Please remember that you're a person too. You have your limits and your own mental health to take care of. It's okay to break up with someone with mental health issues and it's okay to break up with someone because of their mental health issues.",unpopularopinion

Yeah, as far as recreational drugs go it’s pretty harmless; it’s less toxic than alcohol, not chemically addictive, withdrawals aren’t physically painful, but it can still fuck up your life. Constantly getting stoned robs you of your motivation and impairs your ability to function like a normal person.

It’s also way more difficult to quit than most people think, especially if you’ve made it a daily habit. Trying to taper off rarely works because it’s so easy to smoke casually that you’ll never struggle to find an excuse for it. Going cold turkey sucks because you become irritable and impatient, your brain having been flooded with dopamine for so long that the things that would make a normal person happy have no effect on you.

226,1589893302.0,Most people have literally no clue what communism actually is.,"I will start by saying that I'm not the expert either, proving the point. 

I'm using the United States as the basis for this argument since in my country Portugal, we have a Communist Party but their members and people in general actually understand what they believe in and what they want if they managed to become the governing party - it's basically impossible at this moment and they have 7/8% or less every election. 

But in the US I come to realize that people actually have no idea what communism or communist ideas are. Socialism isn't equal to communism. Also, ""everything I disagree with"" isn't communism. You are just an idiot that chooses to be ignorant or that doesn't want to hear ""no"" more often than none.

I would even argue that most people can't even point if a political idea is mostly left or right-wing.

**EDIT 1:**

 It seems to be important to clarify that my goal was never to promote communism as some great idea that is the best option for your country or something. My only point was: people talk about stuff and equate it to communism when there is actually no evidence of it being the case or it being even remotely close in terms of what both represent.


**EDIT 2:** 

In my interpretation and simplifying it, Communism is a socio-economical and political ideology based on a self-sustaining human existence that wants to promote an egalitarian society and with no social classes.

Thanks /u/aprx4 for the correction on the definition. Proving my point that even OP doesn't know the exact and correct definition and that's why I'm not throwing the word around like it's nothing.

**EDIT 3:** 

Taking away your rights =/= communism. Inter-racial marriage =/= communism. Yes, socialism is on the same spectrum of communism but there is a big difference between both ideologies but you can argue that socialism is a middle term for socialism but you can have a Socialist Party that doesn't intend on becoming a Communist Party or even implementing a Communist Regime/Society.

228,1598049403.0,Gaming is a healthier medium for young adults than Social Media and YouTube in terms of mental health,"Gaming has a bad reputation for being addictive and frowned upon by parents since their kids seem to always be gaming and not doing anything productive. Although gaming can be addictive and a time sink, I argue that it's still much better to have a society interested in gaming, especially young adults, than all obsessed with social media and YouTube instead. Of course gamers also use social media and YouTube, but I'm talking about the hardcore users of these other mediums where they don't game and use that time to consume these other mediums more instead.

Social Media: Young adults using social media is terrible for their mental health. Apps like Instagram makes them feel like they need to show off fake affluence, stuff, or go on unnecessary trips to keep up with the Joneses. They need to document their life just because everyone else is and if they don't document it in a way that looks appealing to others , they're afraid of being judged. This is bullshit. On the other hand, if these people didn't put so much emphasis on social media and just games instead, there is no stupid competition between friends since the gamer doesn't value dumb stuff like that as much. They're too involved with the games to be interested in petty and vapid competition between peers.

YouTube: Yes, everyone watches YouTube. But non-gamers who put more time into YouTube I argue can be bad depending on the content they consume. YouTube has all sorts of content, but a lot of the content is paid propaganda to influence people to believe their political agenda. A lot of channels try to get kids to fall down an alt-right rabbit hole without them even realizing that it's happening, they're just browsing videos on YouTube to kill time then all of a sudden they have these right-wing beliefs that they probably wouldn't have if they didn't fall down a rabbit hole. 

Huge channels are funded by organizations to spread influence about their political beliefs, it's not a fair balance. Google doesn't care as long as they're getting paid. If these impressionable young adults were just playing video games, they'd stay away from the politics for the most part and disinformation out there.

247,1620729340.0,"Generic feel-good phrases such as ""you matter"" ""you are loved"" ""you're beautiful"" etc. are insulting and emotionally manipulative, and they make me feel much worse afterwards.","Seriously, there seems to be a trend among some parts of the internet and real life to just flash faux motivational feel-good phrases like these to get cheap emotional responses from people who are truly desperate enough to believe that somewhere on the internet or in their vague proximity there is a person who actually genuinely cares about them. Sorry to break it to you, but they probably can't. How can you care about someone you don't even know personally? They have no idea who you are and you have no idea who they are. You are therefore completely blind to any reasons why you are truly loved by anyone, which makes perceiving this feeling as genuine extremely difficult, and impossible for me.

The sort of people who would actually unironically find these phrases motivational are so devoid of any positive social interaction (which I am not saying NEVER happens but is such a desperate situation) that any string of words vaguely resembling a heartfelt compliment brightens their day. The trouble is that these phrases masquerade as heartfelt compliments but are such cheap emotional signalling that anyone utilising a sliver of their human observation and reasoning can see that they are being emotionally manipulated.

The other day at school, I saw a message scribbled on my desk that said ""Whoever sits at this seat, know that you are loved #SpreadPositivity"". The vagueness in the wording baffled me. If someone sits at this seat, by virtue of just being there, they are loved, and I, sitting in another spot, am no longer told that I'm loved? If I am truly loved by anyone in particular, then the message would have been a lot more personal, and due to the circumstances in which that message is being presented, it could not be. That message would have had some positive effect on me if that were the seat I was assigned to (which would make the message take on a new meaning, hence why here it was used so generically), but no, it was a classroom shared by 4 grades above and below mine and due to COVID we have free seating. The message is not personal; I don't think the writer even knows who I am, and even if they did, it was not targeted at me, so I cannot personally feel good about anything in the message. If anything, seeing that message made me upset, knowing that my feelings have been pandered to in an attempt to have a cheap emotional response elicited from me. I felt manipulated. It was insulting, too; I do not need anyone to remind me that I am loved, especially not from an anonymous entity I don't even know. The message implies that the only criterion that I have to fulfil to be loved is to sit at that particular seat, which makes me feel that I do not actually deserve the praise, since I have not done anything worthy of that praise. I have to work my ass off to get the grades to make my teachers and parents happy, be funny and genuine with my friends to make them happy, and meticulously plan every encounter to make my girlfriend happy. I know that in order to be loved you must be willing to put in the effort, and any ""free love"" you get is not at all genuine. Consider this to be akin to an infinite fountain of counterfeit cash: while you can take as much as you want, all you get in the end is some free paper in case you run out of tissue or toilet roll.

This is a wider problem on the internet, where out-of-touch celebrities, influencers and even some of you on Reddit collectively tell us that we matter or that we are loved blah blah blah. Alright then, if we truly matter, then we don't need you to tell us that we do because we should be able to feel that every day! If our feelings need to be validated in such a way, would that not suggest that we are in fact not loved by many or do not matter to all but one or two? I do not feel any better after reading your post, nor do I appreciate that somehow I am targeted to be emotionally pacified. You only use such generic phrases because you are sure that it would apply to everyone, just as if you were tasked with buying me a shirt without knowing who I am you would probably just buy a plain black or white V-neck because it's such a safe choice, with no polarising or remarkable elements. I have no interest in what you say about me without knowing who I am. I do not deserve to be loved simply because I exist, I should be loved because of who I am and what I do, and if being who I am means that I will grind more people's gears, so be it. Being who I am is expressing my personality. Existing is not a personality.

A big part of what makes a compliment special is how personal it is. I cannot be made to believe that any celebrity, any influencer, or even that Redditor I have never interacted with before know me enough to genuinely compliment me. I know your intentions: You want to scribble something in real life or online, in the hope that someone would stumble upon it and you would brighten their day. But you did not brighten their day. It's an insulting, condescending and frankly manipulative genre of phrase that serves absolutely no purpose.

Anyway, I am by no means saying that we should just stop spreading any form of positivity and self-love. I understand some people are going through tough times in their life and need any emotional support they can get. In that case, establish connections with them in private, make them feel like you give a shit (even if you don't!), DM them, make them feel better as a person with lived experiences, not a publicity stuntman because you either want some Internet brownie points or just want to demonstrate to the world how virtuous and caring you are. Promoting love and positivity only works well if there is even a façade of reciprocity. If you were talking to a friend in great mental distress, your magnum opus surely would not be such a simple phrase overused to shit. So, treat people online as you would people in real life. Have a genuine two-sided conversation and step outside the box of virtue-signalling.

This new genre of feel-good phrases just doesn't work for me, and I'm very sure many other people feel the same way. I just don't see the majority of the Internet agreeing with this though (with all the positivity movements and shit), but hey, that's why I'm here ranting and you're here reading (hopefully). Thanks for listening :)

&#x200B;

tl;dr: What makes a compliment special is how personal it is. Phrases like the ones in the title used between strangers are so generic that they lose any sincerity left in them. Therefore, the people who use these phrases are (willfully or not) engaging in emotional manipulation and the person who unironically feels good in the face of these phrases are really, really fucking desperate and they might need actual help. In that case, stop and talk to them as a person.

Edit 1: I see a lot of you in the comments commenting about how this is a symptom of a lack of empathy. I disagree. Empathy is when you can connect with someone's lived experiences because your imagination and lived experiences allow you to do that. In my case there is a complete lack of information: I don't know who wrote that on my table and the person who wrote it on my table don't know who I am (or even if they do, they most likely don't know I'm going to read it). When there is a complete lack of information, there is nothing to base empathy on.

Edit 2: To clarify, there is a difference (which I have probably not made very clear in my original post) between a conversation between two individuals that one appreciate the other and someone being told by an anonymous random message that they are loved. When this message means the same to everyone, it means nothing to everyone. Telling someone that they are loved (or equivalent) is a personal sentiment. When you, while writing the message, don't care if it ends up in the hands of any person, it brings no value to anyone in particular because it brings everyone else the same value. Then, the message ceases to be personal because it means that nobody feels special after reading it.",unpopularopinion

252,1576672782.0,"If your child asks for birth control, for the love of god please give it to them.","A pretty obvious opinion, but rather unpopular where I’m from in the Midwest. I’m thankful that my mother told me that if I ever needed birth control, she would get it to me. That was 7 years ago when I was 13. Now I’m 20, in a long term relationship, and have been on birth control since 17. Might not like some of the side effects I’ve seen (acne, bloating, slight weight gain etc.) But at least I don’t have a child.   

Both of my two girl friends from high school were not allowed to be on any form of birth control. One had to get it through college, one didn’t have an option till post graduation. 

My point is, you are not going to prevent your kid from having sex by keeping birth control from them. If you as a parent truly think that, you are delusional. Teenagers/young adults will always find a way to do what they want, and their parents telling them ‘no’ is just going to make them want to do it more. 

And this doesn’t just go for girls, I’m only writing it this way because I am a girl, and I know firsthand. Give your son condoms if he needs them, and educate both your sons and daughters about being safe. 

EDIT: Took a nap and came back to all of this. Just wanted to point out a few things as I’ve been scrolling through the comments. 

1. Yes, I am well aware the female birth control does have long term side effects. I’m also aware that it’s trial and error. I’m on my 3rd type of birth control and I’ve never been happier. It’s hard to discover what really works for you and that’s why it’s so important to see a doctor and not order pills online like they have available now. 

2. I’m well aware that female birth control doesn’t protect against STIs. But here’s the thing, condoms don’t protect against babies either. Doubling up on both female birth control AND condoms is a great way to prevent both a baby and STIs. 

3. Some are talking about fertility and birth control. It is known that the birth control shot CAN increase your risk of infertility a bit more than most birth control. But let’s think of other things that can affect fertility. Smoking, extreme weight loss, other types of hormones such as things we put in food, endometriosis. I could go on.

4. Rape happens. If you’re on birth control, chances are you’re not going to get pregnant.

5. Women can do whatever they want with their bodies. 

6. 20 y/o female living in Ohio, grew up catholic. For all you saying religion is the answer.

7. This is definitely leaning more towards girls on the pill, instead of boys with condoms. If you are calling your FEMALE child a whore, slut or anything of the sort, there is something wrong with you. Women can have sex. WOMEN CAN HAVE SEX.

8. How could I forget something so important? BIRTH CONTROL IS USED FOR SO MANY OTHER THINGS.

I agree it's important, but it's nothing you need a parade for.  There are waaaay bigger issues that get very little traction, such as the number of people living in poverty, even in the most developed nations.  Why is that?  Is it that the issues that affect huge percentages are too difficult to address?  Is it that no one in Hollywood is poor, but a disproportionate number are gay, so there is no platform for poverty?  Is the feeling that poverty is a choice?  Why don't we have parades for teachers or people who are working to better the world for much larger percentages of the population?

259,1556268625.0,"Telling people who have severe facial deformities that they're beautiful is disingenuous, patronizing, dishonest, and self-congratulatory.","There's a youtuber named Nikki Lilly who does music and makeup videos on youtube. She looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/HqmUQng.jpg).

If you go to the comments section of any of her videos, you see hundreds or thousands of comments that are telling her how beautiful she is. There are rarely any other kind of comments as far as I can tell.

Now, this kind of strikes me as similar to telling an overweight woman that she is skinny. By no societal standards in the world that I can imagine would this girl be considered physically beautiful. She has a condition that causes her to have a severe and grotesque deformity on half of her face. She doesn't deserve to be bullied for this, of course. But I think the millions of fans she has and these thousands of comments are no coincidence. I think her appearance is the reason for her popularity, and so people view her as a freakshow, just of a different kind. People flock to her to her channel since they see her as a freakshow, but they just leave patronizing comments telling her how beautiful she is so they and everyone who upvotes them can feel good about themselves.

I see this as extremely strange behavior. It's almost as if Nikki is some sort of ""moral well"" from which people can draw in order to feel good about themselves and others, to have an unspoken, massive communal back-patting party in the comments about how good they all are as people. Her videos have thousands or tens of thousands of comments. People know the creator of the video will probably not see the comments, however they *do* know that other people will. That's why they leave these comments.

This is a bizarre new kind of phenomenon, and while I'm always happy for a fellow youtuber getting attention on their channel, I don't think this is a good kind of attention. I think it's actually a very disingenuous and off-putting kind of trend. It leaves me feeling very dirty and confused about the nature of social media.

It wouldn't be so bad if the comments were just normal, mildly supportive or even constructive comments, but these comments are really exaggerated. All caps, dozens of heart emojis, lots of exclamation points. It's almost as if they're trying to one-up each other for who can be the most overwhelmingly supportive and saccharine with their comments. It's actually kind of disgusting. I don't even know if we have words for this kind of behavior, since this is kind of a new phenomenon.

Really, I just feel sorry for this girl. I wonder if she understands what's going on.

EDIT: There are a lot of people talking about the subjective quality of beauty. In case it's unclear, I'm talking about the physical attractiveness of someone's face, which has a [basis in science](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/social-instincts/201507/what-facial-features-do-men-really-find-attractive?collection=1077685). I understand that beauty as a poetic concept does indeed have a high degree of subjectivity, but that's not what I'm talking about. Remember that Nikki is primarily a makeup/beauty vlogger, so comments about her being beautiful are likely referring to her appearance.

271,1585106954.0,"As someone new to Reddit, I find this site a kind of disturbing, Highly Politicized, Karma-addicted, self-defeating hivemind.","Firstly, I think this could be changed quite easily by simply doing away with up/downvotes. As someone new to this site, it seems to me that these do nothing to encourage the free exchange of ideas, and basically just exist to reinforce some kind of unwritten, yet universally understood consensus criteria which is executed unconsciously by members and by which everything is Judged.

People seem to have a vague, instinctual sense of what the Hivemind wants, and play up to it for purposes of generating the social currency of Reddit which is Karma. Sometimes they get it wrong, or just resist it, and in such cases, they are instantly and viciously torn to shreds like an ant entering a stream of ants from a different colony  by other posters who apparently relish such opportunities to pay totem to the reddit Hivemind God, which validates this behavior and rewards their faith once again through the miracle of upvotes.

The net result is a kind of vapid, recycled echo chamber. The froth and dregs, but no middle. The same ideas offered up like prayers, in all manner of instances which may in some cases even be unique in their particularities, but usually aren't, and never vary in theme-- -Forever.

It's a collective beast of emotion operating on some algorithm of demented, utterly artificial and totally insincere pseudo-morality which is either the petard upon which it has hoisted itself or otherwise serves as an excuse to spruik inconsequential, meaningless drivel to the end of feeding its insane and profound addiction to a meaningless Fiat: Karma.

273,1600707236.0,Forcing children to change in front of each other for gym is sexually abusive and this is a hill I will die on.,"When I was in middle and high school, one of the greatest sources of trauma I have ever endured was being forced to change in front of the other girls in locker rooms. They would make fun of my body relentlessly throughout that entire time. Not only was I the nerdy kid, but I basically had the body of a 11 year old until I was 16 and went through a major growth spurt where I went from completely flat chested to 32DD in the span of a single summer. So, my gym experience went from being made fun of for having a child's body to being accused of ""getting implants"" and further ridiculed the rest of my school life. Because it was solely my word against that of 8 other girls, the administration did nothing to stop it, even though the rumors spread like wildfire throughout the entire school. It's worth mentioning that i was extremely embarrassed by how fast my breasts grew, so I wore extreme baggy shirts to try to hide them. However, those attempts to hide them were moot thanks to the locker room before gym.

The worst incident crossed the line into full blown sexual assault. Four of the more popular girls circled around me and violently poked and squeezed my breasts, to the point where it was incredibly painful and they hurt for several days. It was some weird test to see if they were real or implants.

I was molested by a male adult as a 7 year old child and, to be completely honest, the abuse I suffered from my peers that i just described was every bit as traumatizing as that. In a way, it was even worse because there was no escaping it. At least when I told my parents about the abuse from the adult, it was dealt with and I never had to see him again. With the abuse from my peers, I had to suffer for years. 

Some of you might argue ""that was an especially shitty crop of girls, not every locker room experience is like that"". Yeah, but a) the administration didn't believe me because it was my word against everyone else's so I had to go through this shit for SIX FUCKING YEARS despite making literally 8 different complaints. b) quite frankly, it shouldn't take a seriously traumatic scenario to justify the idea that CHILDREN SHOULDN'T HAVE TO STRIP IN FRONT OF PEOPLE UNNECESARRILY WHEN THEY'RE NOT COMFORTABLE. c) if you think locker rooms abuse is rare, you are living under a rock.

Honestly, I gotta say- I genuinely don't see how anyone, besides pedophiles getting off on it, could stand by the idea that we should continue to systemically force children to strip in front of each other.

Person 1 makes an inflammatory statement that strongly challenges another's views. Person 2 (the target of the statement) will take the bait and respond, often in a defensive manner as they feel attacked (they were, that was the point of the initial statement). Person 1, elated with themselves, smugly ridicules person 2 and calls them fragile to shut them down. Person 2 wants to respond, but if they defend themselves, person 1 will claim this is proof of their fragility. If they don't reply, person 1 will claim they've won the argument.

This is such a cheap way of scoring meaningless points. Nothing is gained here. No meaningful discussion is had, no views are changed. If anything, all that happens is person 2 ends up with a stronger negative attitude towards people who align themselves with person 1's views, increasing polarisation. 

The goal should be to win over people that hold opposing views with rational argument, patience and understanding. Ridiculing doesn't work, especially not online.

277,1590086366.0,"Society IS hypersexualised, and I feel scared for the kids growing up with it.","Let me start by saying that I'm 17. This is coming from a place of serious concern. I'm not some boomer trying to rag on the new generation because I have nothing better to do.

Everything is so unnecessarily sexualised these days. Adverts for the most banal products, music, random sex scenes in movies that could have been marketed to younger audiences without them, you name it: there's a naked girl or a weird moaning noise or an obvious innuendo. It's kind of sickening.

A lot of people argue that ""it's not over-sexualisation, it's sexual liberation!"" That this phenomenon is taking motion because people (mostly women, whose ability to do it has been hampered for centuries) are feeling more comfortable in their bodies and with expressing their sexuality. And that's great! 

But we don't need it everywhere. Every second tweet coming across my timeline is someone oversharing on their sexual experiences for clout and every song and music video is geared towards some sort of sexual stimulation/release. Everything is just constantly screaming sex, sex, sex.

Now, here's where my concern comes in: if the Internet was made up solely of people who had a sharp grasp on reality and on themselves, this onslaught of sexual content wouldn't be nearly as worrying as it is. But that's not the case. Younger, much more impressionable kids are using the Internet nowadays, and it's bleeding into the content I see from them.

Take the biggest culprit as example: TikTok. What may seem to many of us as completely harmless because the constant wave of hypersexualised content has practically immunised us to its effects would terrify any mother, and I couldn't say I would blame it. Kids doing sexual POVs, inappropriate dances, and dressing the way that they do is all a cause of the fact that they see older people doing it, normalising it, and running with it. There have been countless times that I have seen videos of boys standing shirtless in their rooms lipsynching to sexual lyrics and girls dancing incredibly explicitly and then I click on their page and see that they're 13, 14, 15, or 16.

That is horrifying to me. It's basically a new wave of paedophile fodder, and it's the fault of society's hypersexualisation.

I'm not here to pearl clutch and say that sexual expression should not be allowed or something. Of course not; everybody should be able to do exactly what they want to do. But we have to be extremely conscious of the people that are seeing our content, however fleetingly, and censor ourselves for their safety. I'm also not here to say that wearing certain clothes somehow constitutes immediate sexual intentions from other people: but you have to admit that nonces are more likely to go for children they see as ""easy"" and therefore vulnerable. That's why I'm so fucking scared for them.

Anyway, this is just an opinion. Looking forward to the ""society has always been sexual"" comments.",unpopularopinion

(**Original post below here**)

have a feeling this is going to be an unpopular post, because regarding the [recent news](https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/1195123215657508867) about Taylor's record label dispute, reddit has been overwhelmingly in support of her.

Taylor Swift is always playing the victim. Almost all of her songs are about how some boy came along and broke her heart, and how tragic that is because she was a perfect angel girlfriend and he was the absolute devil.

Example. She put [Joe Jonas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amh859mNeKI) on blast over their breakup. Told everyone on Ellen that he broke up with her in a 20 second phone call. But Joe Jonas came out and said that the only reason the phone call was so short was because *she* hung up on him.

Ok, but she was only 19 with this happened. Surely she's grown and changed as a person since then?

Nope. I'm not gonna link sources because you can find them easily on google, but she continues to have relationships like this. They end bitterly and she writes a song or makes a snarky public comment about how awful her ex is. Examples:  John Mayer, Calvin Harris, Harry Styles, Jake Gyllenhaal.

Look at her feuds with other celebrities. Kanye and Katy Perry are kind of insane, but she's fought with many others: Rihanna, Miley Cyrus, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, the list goes on.

Look at how she defends herself in all of these situations. She has literally told lies (ex: the kanye west debate and the joe jonas thing) to paint a better portrait of her as the victim.

And didn't she lie about her masters situation when the news first broke, too? Didn't it come out that Taylor did know about the deal and did have the opportunity to buy her masters, but she passed it up?? It seems she had the power to stop this from ever happening in the first place.

Now she's posting some pretty big accusations of him publicly, but she has nothing to back up her claims. She is literally asking her fans to brigade someone and have blind faith that what she's saying about him is completely true.

It definitely could be true. And I do feel bad for her if that's the case.

But she's a 30 year old grown ass woman. Worth half a billion dollars. She could afford the best attorneys in the world to take this guy down. But she decides to vent on twitter and ask her teenage fans to attack someone based on her word alone (which has historically been unreliable). I get that people think this is an important message to spread. But the way she worded it sure seemed like it wasn't about spreading awareness so much as it was about getting revenge.

Taylor Swift reminds me of a high schooler. Her ""squad"" is a clique and she is their Regina George. She has a pattern of unstable relationships and an inability to see her own flaws in them.

Taylor seems to think everyone else is the problem. Nah Taylor, you're the problem. The common factor in all these situations is you.

299,1595186868.0,Summer is THE worst season.,"I absolutely HATE summer. It is incredibly hot and sticky outside. It also makes it hard to breathe outside. Depending on where you are, there’s also a ton of pests. 
Even winter is better. It’s the holidays and lights but also snow is gorgeous. It’s nice to just bundle up when it’s cold and have some hot chocolate or coffee. I’m more inclined to leave the house in the winter time than the summer time.

It baffles me when people say “oh yeah I LOVE it when it’s hot. I love it when it’s in the 90’s.” For those of you using Celsius, it’s between 33 and 38. Like what is wrong with you???? People talk about going to the beach and then when you go the beach you also get sunburned. Nothing fun about that.

300,1628602995.0,Infertile couples should just adopt instead of making a big fuss trying to make a miracle baby,"Every time I hear of fertility struggles online, or see posts about people going through rounds of IVF and the ensuing emotional trauma of miscarriages, It kind of disgusts me.



I also work for a major insurer and know that fertility treatments are driving up everyone else's premiums because they're considered necessary care. Sorry, but I disagree.



It's a well known fact that there are over 400,000 children in foster care, and in 2017 alone over 100,000 infants under 3 entered the system.
I think it's completely entitled and self-absorbed to think that somehow your miracle baby is worth more or deserves more love than any one of those infants. 



I know adoption can be hard, and that it should be made easier for the sake of children finding good homes, but you can't tell me adopting is harder than 4 rounds of IVF and multiple miscarriages. I've seen friends go through that mess and at the end they are different people.

305,1612726742.0,Men who wish men got complimented more often should start a culture change by complimenting other men instead of expecting women to do it,"In my few years on Reddit, I can't begin to count the times I've seen posts where men say how rarely they get complimented and how much they like it.  They write how much their self-esteem suffers because they never get complimented on their physical appearance. It's either bluntly stated or at least implied that women are lucky because we get complimented more.

Here's the thing though, at least my my own personal experiences and that of my female friends and coworkers over the years:  Women usually prefer compliments from other women more than ones from men (unless of course they already have a relationship with that man).  When a man compliments you, you don't know if he did so with any expectations.  It can awkward as F if a male coworker says you look good, and can sometimes make all future interactions with them uncomfortable.  Maybe this is unfair, but every woman I know well enough to have serious talks with has had experiences where they or someone they know had compliments turn into harassment.  When female coworkers compliment each other though, the (presumed) lack of any romantic subtext makes it much friendlier and positive.  And since we like getting compliments from women, we therefore compliment other women.  If my husband and I go over to a friend's house, I'll tell her that her hair looks amazing.  When a coworker comes to work in a new dress, I'll tell her it looks great on her.  And no, I'm not going to compliment a male coworker in the same way.  I might say ""I like that colour"" or ""New suit?  It's nice!"" or something similar to the guys I'm friends with, but that's about it.  It's not my or any other random woman's responsibility to compliment you just because you need it to boost your self esteem.

If you think men don't get enough compliments, start complimenting other guys.  Maybe it will start a culture shift in your environment that results in you getting the compliments you want.  If you think that it would be awkward, then you're acknowledging that compliments to or from people of the opposite gender have romantic or sexual subtexts- why else would you find it awkward to tell a male coworker he looks great in a certain outfit or with a certain haircut?

ETA- first of all, thanks so much for all the awards!  

2- For the guys who say they already do this- that's awesome and I hope I don't come across as condescending!

3- For the ones who say they can't do this without being seen as gay, well, a) that's not an insult, and b) the guys in point 2 prove that it's not always true.

307,1585263162.0,If your boyfriend/husband is uncomfortable with a certain guy friend because he “knows their intentions” 90% of the chance he’s right.,"Now this isn’t saying that every time your boyfriend see’s another guy talking to you he has the right to be upset, this isn’t condoning abusive and controlling relationships by a long mark. There are certain situations where the other guy could be a longtime friend, or be with another person, or just have no interest in that sense, and it doesn’t mean that being overly jealous is a healthy behavior. What it is about is if a guy suddenly comes into the girls life and is very flirty, always demeans the boyfriend on the littlest things in hopes to cause a fight, and is overly nice and affectionate to the point it’s weird and if it’s at that point that “friend” is not trying to just be friends. There’s a difference between “Hey I hope you’re having a good day” and “Hey cutie how’s it going you wanna hangout at my place?” Most guys think alike and we can see when a guy is obviously trying to shoot his shot. If you’re letting someone talk to you like that and just let them proceed while your significant other has stated they don’t feel comfortable with they talk to you, you’re the one causing the problem and being toxic. Just respect your significant others feelings and emotions by understanding their point of view and tell that person they can’t flirt with you like that. My ex always had guy friends acting like this and she always insisted they didn’t like her that way, and unsurprisingly the week we broke up they all confessed their feelings for her and that they’ve liked her all along.

If you have a guy friend who makes a move and you put him in the friend zone, he has every right to not stay in your life. Some guys want to date you plain and simple. These guys probably had a crush on you from the start and pursued you in the hopes of a romantic relationship. These guys listened to your problems, took interest in your day, and cared about your needs to show you they can be a good partner. But it's not the same as a platonic friendship. If you friendzone a guy like this, he will do one of two things: 

1) Stick around with either the hopes you'll change your mind (super common) or because he feels he can quickly move on and be genuine friends (rare)

2) Not talk to you again because he doesn't want to hear about you seeing other guys or hear about your boy problems.

310,1599413356.0,I wish there were more movies where the protagonists lost.,"I love watching movies, especially with friends. We go out and enjoy new movies and talk about stuff and just overall have a great time, but over the last few years I have been thinking about what movies were the most memorable to me. 

(Potential Spoilers Ahead) Some of the movies I found most memorable are movies like No Country For Old Men, Avengers Infinity War, Se7en, Fight Club, Hannibal etc etc. These movies are all super memorable to me not only because they're good movies but because they break free from the trend of invincible protags that you know are going to win in the end. Now movies where the hero wins are not inherently bad or anything, I just feel like a lot of them lose at least a small bit of their tension because of it. When I watch an action thriller I want to really worry for the heroes, I want to be attached to them and sit at the edge of my seat because I'm not really sure if they will actually make it out alive.

 I find myself getting invested much much more often when uncertainty is part of the movie. I want to worry. I want my heart to race. I want to cry. I want to get mad. I believe that if a movie is capable of making you feel true emotion, it succeeded in what it set out to do. If you cry at the end of a movie you were most certainly invested in the story, and right now I feel like many studios are just too afraid to break the mold in that way. I can understand, I mean money is on the line and lots of it at that. It is definitely a gamble to try to ignore the standard movie structure because many people are so used to it that if a movie doesn't follow that structure, it can feel off or confusing to the viewers, but those movies that do successfully break free of it are often very very memorable because of it.

TLDR: Movies that break the mold and try something unique adds uncertainty to the movie. That uncertainty causes the viewer to become invested in the movie as they never truly know what could happen in the end. If you think the protagonist truly could die or lose, you feel the same emotions they do, and if a movie is able to get you to feel emotion it definitely succeeded in my opinion.",unpopularopinion

Maximizing muscle growth takes a lot less than you might think. About an hour a day of focused lifting and eating in a slight surplus. They feed us this lie though because most of us can’t afford trainers and chefs, so it’s somewhat believable.

329,1600134174.0,Hard tacos actually suck and are the inferior taco delivery device.,"I just got 3 hard tacos instead of the soft that I ordered and I’m not driving back to fix it but I am increasingly bothered by each bite. Why do people choose this for themselves??

Think about it, plebs. 

No average human can fit a full hard taco shell into their mouths, which mean close to half the bites are just chips and toppings- not to mention that’s only IF you get at least halfway through the taco without it crumbling into a sad Mexican shame salad in the wrapper. Am I supposed to funnel into my mouth like a freaking savage? Or do I get up off the couch(which I was too lazy to leave to get the dang tacos in the first place) to get a bowl or plate to hold  so I can eat it like nachos without embarrassing myself or spilling it. At least with a soft taco I have a CHANCE to get an equal amount of fillings in one bite. 

Why? 
Just why? 



JUST WHY?!

Edit: some things to mention:
1- I see you haters saying it’s not an unpopular opinion but I read you, and you’re wrong.
2- as much as I would love to hand form a hard tortilla, wrap it in a soft taco, toast the shells in the oven, or otherwise doctor this taco, I’m exhausted as HELL and that’s why I ordered freaking Taco Bell in the first place. Don’t gutter palette shame me, guys- a bitch is tired and nothing good is close or open

3- it’s unreal the amount of people that think I’m just a messy eater. If I was a messy eater, then the fact that the tacos make a mess wouldn’t bother me- instead it’s really hard to eat messy food holding a baby, which is how I eat 90% of my meals.",unpopularopinion
330,1592020133.0,"Society should run in shifts so that people who are naturally night owls can go about their lives comfortably, not just the morning people. This would actually benefit the world in several ways.","I’ve read that in early hunter-gatherer civilizations, people would work & sleep in shifts. Some were awake during the day, some at night, and some in between. This was to ensure the safety of the group, and likely to maximize productivity as well. This seems to be why humans have evolved to be either “morning larks” or “night owls”. 

Since these traits still exist in humans, our societies should reflect this. Many people I know are total night owls, and find it very difficult to get out of bed & function at the hours that society demands. Yet they are full of creativity, energy & drive at night, firing on all cylinders & getting some fantastic work done. I believe that if society were to operate in shifts, many of these types of people would choose to work at night & sleep in during the day. There are some jobs that offer night shifts but there are not many, and there are basically no options for dining/shopping/activities/etc late at night. 

If this system was put into place, of course it wouldn’t be binding. You would be allowed to switch between working during the day or during the night, or somewhere in between, you’d just have to work it out with your employer. I believe this would also lower the crime rate, as those who choose to commit crimes in the nearly empty & quiet streets of nighttime would find it a lot harder to go unnoticed. 

I’ve considered the potential costs of businesses staying open 24/7, and while I haven’t really calculated the specifics on this one yet (someone smarter than me can chime in on this in the comments) I think it could work. Not every business would be obligated to stay open 24/7, but I believe that employers will be able to find many night-inclined people who would choose to work odd hours if given the option over waking up at the ass crack of dawn. There could be “day divisions” and “night divisions” of companies, which would be able to work parallel to each other & collaborate through meetings at in-between times that can work for all. 

There are other interpersonal factors that I haven’t quite worked out (what if a day person falls in love with a night person? What about schools, should they offer this option too? What would this do to families?) because honestly this is just a hypothetical system I thought of while moaning about how I really really don’t want to wake up early tomorrow. But I do see many potential benefits if all the details are ironed out correctly. Again, if anyone smarter than me is reading this and wants to give their take on this system’s economic/interpersonal/political impacts, I’d love to hear it.

Maybe the nighttime world wouldn’t be quite as active as the daytime one, but it would be a lot more active than it is now. And maybe, through giving people the chance to work & live in a way that is best suited for their individual biology, societies will be able to increase productivity as well as overall quality of life.

If a nut is going to kill you, you definitely shouldn't be out in public because eventually, you are going to get hit with some nuts.

Then there are certain years where someone might have a specific allergy and the class teacher will send a letter home saying the kids aren't to have any of THAT product in the food they bring to school.

The savoury taste of mayo goes perfectly with the sweet hot chocolate. It has an added benefit of not triggering any lactose intolerances. 

For anyone wondering, the only way to make watered down mayo without it being just a bunch of globules of mayo. You have to put the mayo in a food processor and slowly add water, essentially emulsifying it with the water.

Edit: From the thousands of replies that I've gotten, I've learnt many things. 

1. There's something called Viennese Hot Chocolate which uses egg yolk in the drink to make it thick, and uses the same emulsifying technique that I use. 

2. Mayo is a common ingredient in chocolate cakes and brownies. Major names like Portillo's swear by it for their chocolate cakes. 

3. Oil is a great emulsifying agent. 

4. Acidity(mayo has vinegar) is a great addition to chocolate.

Edit 2: I can't keep up with all the recipe demands so I'm just gonna post it here. 

Nearly equal parts of mayo and water, a little less water than mayo. Water has to be hot, but not boiling hot or the mayo turns into a bunch of globules. 

You start blending the mayo in a food processor/blender and start adding the water slowly, and once you've emulsified all the water, add your preferred hot chocolate mix(mine is Cadbury). 

I've only tried it with Heinz and Kraft, someone tried it with Hellmann's but apparently it didn't turn out right. I didn't get details on how it went wrong though.",unpopularopinion

I typed comments with the same tone that I speak, and it *did not* go well with any redditors at all. Even when I was just joking, or being sarcastic, or just poking fun at something, I got heavily downvoted. If I shared something personal without that tone which establishes that I'm a happy, positive, nice person, it always became content for other subs. I deleted that, went off Reddit for a while, came back.

In the last few weeks, I've acted like a redditor. When I'm posting comments in a happy go lucky, positive, 'hey look at me I'm a chill down to earth dude who's also thankful for what he has and is not braggy and is funny without trying too hard', then I'm getting upvoted like crazy. Even trivial comments which don't add much to the conversation get upvoted, so do posts which don't have any opinions whatsoever. If you're posting about a game or a tv show and you establish right from the beginning that you absolutely LOVE it, followed by a tiny critique, you get upvoted.

The minute you post your whole opinion, without *trying* to hard to be super positive and just sharing your thoughts about it, how maybe you didn't find that game or movie or tv show too good, or maybe point out the flaws or loopholes, or anything that is even remotely off the path from the general *fans* of the content, you get super downvoted.

You don't even need to post something hateful or offensive. Just disagree with the general opinion on a thread filled with only positives about something, without being rude or hateful or sarcastic, you'll be downvoted.

Redditors only love others who type in the exact manner that they want Reddit to be. They don't want this to turn into Facebook or Instagram or Tumblr, and they know how they want Reddit to be, so they force you to turn into *The perfect* redditor, who says things in a particular way, always justifies their thoughts or opinions if they want to even slightly go against the general opinion. 

Biggest example is the emoji use. If you use an emoji, just one, even though your comment makes sense 100% and is factually correct and is the best thing that anyone has every typed on the internet, you're gonna get downvoted. 

If you type about your achievement, but without the obligatory, 'I'm not much of an artist' or 'I only have been practicing for 3 weeks and I'm not really good at it, but here is my...', then you're judged as being braggy, instantly, and you'll be screenshotted and posted on other subs (hasn't happened to be, but I've seen it happen).

375,1620340447.0,There is nothing noble about choosing to keep a pregnancy knowing it will end with a genetically disordered child.,"I am a special needs parent whose son's disorder is so rare that they couldn't detect it in utero. He was diagnosed at almost 1 after, in addition to the many other problems he was having, he began to have seizures and thus genetic testing. 

I am currently pregnant and on a parent forum where so many parents post about not knowing if they would do the early genetic screening and it's followed by even more parents saying it would matter what the results are they wouldn't do anything about it. 

Life is hard. Life as a special needs parent is even harder. I've lived both ways and I hate the naivety and toxic positivity that dwells among these communities.

I hate that my son was born with his issues. It has taken a toll on every aspect in my life. There is no real specials needs child care. The amount of procedures, doctors appointments, surgeries, extensive therapies, equipment is ungodly expensive and exhuasting. He suffers in ways that I can't do anything about. My relationship has gravely suffered, we never get to spend time without him and when we do it's brief. 

There isn't a day that goes by that I don't wish this wasn't my life. I see too many people on instagram etc. Posting in matching clothes with inspirational quotes and nobody is being honest. It sucks. It's not fair to me or my family.

It's isolating as hell. People act like you're an amazing parent just because you're going through this when half the time I'm falling apart.  

Does any of this mean I don't love and cherish my son? No. But, If faced with results of another genetic disorder or something similar, I would absolutely terminate.

Edit: I feel like people need to understand something which I've commented to another user:

This post specifically highlights the hardships I face. Which is relevant to the point I'm making. It doesn't mean I don't love my son. Loving him and treating him well is not mutually exclusive to the struggles his disorder causes myself and my family. 

Being honest and candid about how hard it is instead of fairy taling myself as some noble hero and smiling my way through it all allows a space for other parents or be able to feel safe in their own challenges. Many of these parents desperately need that. Many people need to understand that it is willfully ignorant to not consider the genuine challenges they will face forever with a special needs child. 

If you can't separate the fact that if I were given a crossroads choice of being a special needs parent or not, knowing what I know, that I would always chose not to be and thinking that it means I don't love my son, then you do not understand, at all.

388,1616060007.0,"There is a massive disconnect in most relationships specifically because men are taught how to treat a woman as they grow up, but women are not taught how to treat a man.","***This has gained some traction so I feel it is time fore some cleaning up, and clarification. The original post will remain at the bottom***

1. If you are using this thread to hate on women or think that is the point of this post you can kindly piss off. That is sad and embarrassing.

2. This post is about the disconnect of the majority of girls growing up without having many sources of information on how to communicate intimately with men in a relationship. Is this 100% true? Obviously not.... However, think back for at least a decade though and lets take a look at television specifically. This is also directly correlated with male fragility and how tv shows portrayed men and how they should act to ""be manly, be attractive, or have some value in a relationship."" The majority of the time ""romantic"" storylines are written about boys falling head over heels for some girl and then doing everything in their power to make things work. The most inclusive thing I've ever seen for female characters is the typical ""I like this boy but I don't know what to do."" and the obligatory ""Just be yourself and if he likes you It'll work out.""

3. The subservient topic and the early 1900s. Yeah, that was a time where women were basically house slaves made to serve men. That was terrible and not how relationships should work. Women were treated as objects and told what to do. Thing is folks, this post isn't about that. Trying to justify an overwhelming majority of women not knowing how to communicate intimately with a man by bringing up a subservient lifestyle of the past is just blatantly avoiding the point. I DO NOT WANT WOMEN TO SERVE MEN. What I am focusing on is what resources do most girls have growing up that teaches them to discuss a mans feelings and emotions? 

4. In case you are trying to make this a blame woman post you are completely wrong. The majority of this issue is derived from men protecting their status over the years. For a long time the media industry was dominated by males due to heavy sexist views from the past. Dear god has anyone seen a western before 1990. I'm just saying it would be cool to have movies or tv shows that can teach WOMEN AND MEN that men can be fragile and can cry, and get butterflies and flirt. We are barely scratching the surface of this and I think its awesome but we have a long way to go.

5. If you feel the need to argue this post try using the better argument that we need more shows and movies and media to teach men how to not be pieces of shit when acting towards women. We are still in that zone where men are written so poorly most of the time its a bit cringe to see how these scenes play out. Hell, half the time the shitty guy ends up with a girl anyways so some poor boys will think that it will actually work.

6. I'm getting a lot of messages about women being brought up to believe they need to ""please men"". That's exactly what I am talking about being the issue. That's a shitty mindset made by people of the past that's slowly fading out. It would be cool if it could change even faster.

7. I thought it would be fun to mention and with her permission I wanted others to know my girlfriend helped me make this post. While she doesn't agree 100% we have had discussions about this and her favorite example is hallmark movies. I didn't even consider that but she grew up watching hallmark movies and those things are just toxic examples of any relationship. Yeah in the end its all happy but really look at what happened to get that point. Get in one argument and leave your husband to marry a guy you lead on years ago from your home town you thought you'd never see again.

8. I'm going to add this again for all the hate mail I am getting. To the ladies out there talking about how they were raised to serve men. That is the problem. That is wrong. That does not teach women how to address men's feelings or emotions. It is a horrible ideology that needs to be eliminated. Everyone saying ""I wAs RaIsEd bEinG ToLd tO SeRvE MeN sO YoU ArE WrOnG"" are actually backing up my argument that there is very little taught on how to converse about men's emotions or feelings. You are agreeing with me that the teachings are shit and need to be changed. I don't get it, why does everyone feel like this was a personal attack.

Most young boys get advice from their parents on how women should be treated as they get older. However it doesn’t stop there for the boys. In social media, tv shows, advertisements, children shows, movies, even video games. Boys are shown many many ways to treat a woman in a relationship. Not all of these are good ways I might add. Regardless there is a steady stream of influential content that will shape a boy into making decisions on how to treat women. 

On the other hand, what is taught to young girls about how to treat a man when they get older? What source of media or family member is letting girls know how to talk to men. How to communicate with them. Almost every source for young girls focuses on vanity and self worth. Always setting a bar and rules that have to be met. It’s always about self rising up, and nobody else deserves your time unless you decide they are special. This is why most men will find affection in anything a girl does for them.

392,1612373325.0,"Kids in 2021 enjoy being outside just as much as kids in 1970. The problem ""these days"" is with parents, not kids.","This seems to be an extremely unpopular opinion, because all I ever hear are adults bashing kids for ""not wanting to do anything but sit inside and play video games"" or ""all they do is stare at their phone"". Some of this may be true, but it's almost entirely the fault of parents. As a millennial, I only feel it fair to point out that our generation has largely failed our kids when it comes to being active and just generally being helicopter parents. I come from a decent sized family, live in a place where the weather is generally pleasant year round and know a lot of kids in my neighborhood due to being social with neighbors. Of all the kids I know, all of them love being outside. 


Here's the biggest difference: when we were kids, we went outside and played no matter what our parents were doing. If our parents were outside, we were outside. If our parents were inside watching tv, we were probably still outside. The only reason things ever changed from this formula, is because so many millennials are only open to letting their kids play outside if they can sit there and watch them the entire time. To make it worse, my generation seems extremely divided. People are either very active and bring their kids along, or they are complete home bodies who spend the vast majority of their time inside, subsequently keeping their kids cooped up inside the majority of the time with them.   


Of all the kids I know (which is a lot) the ones who have active parents love and appreciate the outdoors. The kids I know who's parents are home bodies are tons of fun and very active on the rare occasion that they get to go outside, but because their parents keep them inside most of the time they naturally take on things like video games and internet surfing. 


This opinion is not meant to argue reasons why or why not my generation lets their kids play outside. I am not saying people should feel comfortable letting their kids wander the streets for hours on end. That's a different debate. My opinion is simply that adults of all generations need to stop giving kids a hard time over being home bodies because it's not their fault, and many (if not all of them) would prefer to be outside most of the time.",unpopularopinion

Meanwhile, ""traveling"" is often portrayed as the enlightened way to pass your time. Of course there is nothing inherently wrong with traveling, but I disagree that people who travel a lot are automatically any less shallow than those who go clubbing or buy a lot of stuff. 

First of all, ""travel culture"" is a form of flexing. It has become less acceptable to brag about owning expensive stuff, so people now brag about their trips. Especially on Instagram, it is obvious that many use their travels to flex and show us how ""superior"" they are. 

""Traveling"" doesn't make you an enlightened intellectual in any way.

They can use the Internet to explore a country, without traveling there and contributing to its destruction. (tourism can be very bad for the environment)

405,1565710000.0,A bad teacher has a worse influence on society than a drug dealer,"A bad teacher can make hundreds of people hate a subject, or even school, for their whole life. This means while an average drug dealer has bad influence on society and on their clients, if we compare individually ONE teacher and ONE drug dealer, it's debatable if having a bad influence on the education and professional life of hundreds of children is worse or not than selling drugs to a smaller fraction of the people. I think it is.

Furthermore, a child giving up school while young because of a teacher is way more likely to die young or to go to jail, or even to become a drug dealer, which is quite ironic here, because if a bad teacher caused only one dealer, he has had a worse influence than a dealer. For those of you who will say that drug dealers actually kill people when teachers don't, a lot of people turn to drugs (excluding medicinal) in indirect consequence of quitting school, which is not to blame only on teachers, but they should take a part of the blame, and a huge one in some cases

411,1655826361.0,"Any service you're legally required to purchase (like car insurance) needs to be offered by the government, not for profit.","I feel like this should be common sense, but apparently not. If the government is telling people that they have to purchase a service, then they need to offer that service in a nonprofit capacity. Otherwise, they're essentially enabling an entire industry of private companies to extort people for profit under the threat of fines/revocation of privileges/jail.

I'm not necessarily saying that private, for-profit versions of the same type of service shouldn't be allowed to exist; they just can't be the only option when you're mandated to partake.

**EDITS TO ADD:**

**1)** A whole bunch of people are either misunderstanding my post or just not reading it. **I'm not saying that taxpayer money should be used to pay for car insurance.** Imagine the exact same structure we have now (drivers pay a premium based on their driving history, car type, etc) and receive whatever type of coverage they're paying for. The only difference would be that the service wouldn't be run for the express purpose of **trying to make money**; it would be run to break even and **give people the best value for money possible**.

**2)** Saying 'you aren't required to drive a car/it's not a right to drive a car' is just not a realistic statement in the USA. People often live in rural areas because they *can't afford* to leave in the city (close to their underpaying job) and don't have access to public transportation to get to work, therefore they need a car.

**3)** The 'look at all these bad government programs!' argument is getting repeated a bunch of times with **zero** evidence attached to the comments. Please start at least being constructive. I'll go first: there's a long and storied history of politicians (most of them belonging to a specific party which shall remain nameless) who systematically and intentionally underfund and mismanage public programs in order to provide 'evidence' they need to be privatized. The problem isn't government ownership of the program; it's greedy people in a position of power trying to exploit a system for their own gain. You'll get this in both public and private sector endeavors. With the government, at least we can try to hold them accountable via the democratic process; with private CEO types we have no real sway over them, especially when their service is something we're *required* to buy.

**SECOND, SALTY EDIT:**

Since all the diehard capitalist fanboys came out to play, I need to break something down for y'all. **Profit isn't the only incentive that exists for people to do good work.** Is every amateur videogame modder, music creator, artist, etc **only** creating what they do because they're secretly hoping to become filthy rich? The answer is a pretty obvious no. People can be driven for any number of reasons.

Secondly, the private market and the government are both comprised of *people*; they're not magically different from one another in their construction. The main difference is that private companies are in business, principally, to make as much money as possible (there are some few exceptions, but the bigger you get, the fewer there are). That means they're going to do whatever they can to squeeze you, the customer, for as much $$$ as possible, which translates into giving you the *least* service for the *most* cost that the market can bear. This arrangement only serves to benefit those who are already in a position of power and can realize the excess profit from this equation. The rest of us just get shafted.

**EDIT**: To the people saying, ""Don't give any explanation, just say ""sorry I missed your call"" and leave it at that."" My whole point is that sometimes, people will press to know why you were busy and why you missed their call or what you were doing. In this case, you should be able to say ""sorry, just didn't feel like talking to anyone!"" Even if you say ""Sorry I can't talk, I'm busy"" people will most likely try to call you back at a time when they think you won't be busy.

The problem is misinformed people being fed news from Facebook, Instagram, or the constantly running biased news channel.

430,1575710258.0,The American style of tipping is a toxic culture that should be abolished,"Now, before I continue, I would like to say that I ain't American, but I have read about how tipping works there from reddit. Thus, according to Internet law, I'm an expert on the matter. (In all seriousness though, just correct me if I'm wrong)

- First of all, you guys say that tipping is necessary in order for workers to earn above minimum wage. However, isn't it a rule in most establishments that if the employee doesn't make enough through tips, their boss should cover the rest? What do you know, apparently untipped waiters aren't suffering from lack of cash. You might say that if tipping is abolished, the cost of food in restaurants will rise. So what? You are already paying extra through your bloody tips, just divert that cash to a higher price of a meal. Just make things a bit more simple. 

- Apparently, there is also cases of employers 'stealing' their workers tips or forcing them to 'share' it. Like how certain restaurants force their waiters to equally share their hard earned tips with their fellow workers. What the fuck is that? So if I work hard, treat my client extra super special awesome and received a glorious 50% percent tip for my hard work, I must share it with lazy Harry who sleeps in the storeroom every chance he get? And don't tell me that waiters have to share their tips with the cooks for the sake of 'fairness'. After all, don't cooks earn above the min wage? 

- Unlike most people apparently, I love maths. Damn, how I loved it, and I was pretty good at it. Nevertheless, it doesn't mean that I want to do a freaking mental calculation everytime I finish a meal. Like wtf people, I wanna chill after I finish dinner. And don't you people start giving me pointers on simple ways to calculate how much to tip a person. I find it twisted that tipping is so ingrained in American culture that you guys make a literal rule for it. Japanese student bow to their teachers respectfully before starting class, but any American asshole who gives below 20% for a tip is the scum of the earth and is a reserved a special VIP room in hell. 

- Plus, tipping culture apparently breeds a sense of entitlement among some in the service industry. I've read stories about waiters and waitresses who turn their nose away from what they presume is a 'low' tip and even 'subtly' hint that they should get a higher amount. Like bitch, you are literally getting money from someone whom isn't entitled to pay you squat and you got the audacity to be choosy about it. 

- Why only waiters get to be tipped? Why not the janitors, the maids or the garbage men? Some of them have even tougher jobs then waiters. They don't get tipped. I mean, when have you guys even said thank you to the guys who scrubbed your toilet bowl squeaky clean? Not to mention how some waiter may be lucky enough to earn double or triple above the minimum wage if they work at a particularly affluent restaurant. A bit unfair isn't it?

- I feel like the easiest way to solve this problem is for the American legislation to get amended so that the workers in the service industry get paid according to the minimum wage. So why are you all so stupid that you can't figure out this simple solution? 

- Now, I'm not saying that tipping is bad. However, it should be used to show appreciation rather than being something mandatory. Hell, some restaurants even include tipping in the bill as a gratuitous fee. How presumptuous is that? Crap, I'm straying of point. Anyway, like I was saying, tipping should be a choice on the customer's behalf, to pay for some particularly outstanding service from their waiter. It shouldn't be freaking corrupted by being made socially compulsory. 


You guys might be wondering why the hell I decided to post this. I don't live in America, nor do I plan to. This has nothing to do with me whatsoever, so why am I being a busybody? Well, it's because this annoys me. It's really, really annoying on how this whole issue is so stupid and unnecessarily overcomplicated. Of course, this ain't the only time America decided to be 'different' in order to separate themselves from the rest of the world only to end up looking like idiots. Remember the imperial system crap? Similarly, this whole issue is such a big pain in the ass for everybody that I internally cringe everytime I think about. So, I decided to vent about it by bashing the Americans. That's all.







Edit 1: Most of you talk about how tipping is a good thing because servers get more money than if they totally depend on min wage. That working as a server is so horrible that nobody will do it if not for the tips. Well, guess what? There are other shitty jobs out there and they don't get tipped for it so this seems pretty unfair to me. Basically, servers want this culture to stay, despite they getting less than minimum, because its better for them compared to the customers.

Edit 2: What's up with Europe and shitty service? You guys keep talking about how tipping incentives servers in America and you use your experience with Europe to prove that. This is not a thing in Southeast Asia, where I actually live, cuz people provide good service here WITHOUT EXPECTING TIPS. You Westerners are seriously dissapointing me here.

Edit 3: My god, you servers are salty af clinging to your precious tips just because you want to enjoy a lavish lifestyle that other minimum wage workers don't enjoy. You guys are a bunch of whiny entitled crybabies.

Edit 4: One thing I feel like I have to remind you guys is that I'm not hating on tipping. Instead I feel that we should only tip when we get great service, not average service. Unfortunately, though its purely voluntary, Americans are socially pressured to tip, even for shitty service. This is what I dislike.",unpopularopinion

459,1556552133.0,The death of a young adult is generally sadder than the death of a child.,"Generally speaking, everyone seems to think that a life that ends at its very beginning is the saddest thing ever. Frankly, I believe that dying of sickness or an accident when you're a young adult (20-35 years old more or less) is way out more brutal.

The child leaves almost nothing behind. It's terrible for the family, that's for sure, but at the same time that person hasn't brought anything to the world yet and most of children don't even know what's happening while they're dying.   On the other hand a young adult leaves friends, sometimes a companion or children. They had something to live for, absolute lucidity on the matter and a half fulfilled life that they will never be able to put a good ending to.

I don't mean to say that children deserve more to die than young adults, that's obvious, but generally speaking I think that the death of a person who already lived half a life and leaves it all behind  is way out sadder than just a kid that has no or very little conscience of what's happening and most of the time does not have something to live for other than the only fact of living.

It is better to remain silent and be assumed to be a fool than to speak and remove all doubt.

People these days just talk and talk, and then wait their turn to talk some more while pretending to listen to what other people have to say.  Nobody listens.  

People also have a terrible habit of talking about things they don't know a goddamn thing about, just for the sake of having something to say.  People are too afraid to say ""I don't know"" like its some kind of vulgar phrase.  People talk before they think, and act before they think entirely too much.

If what you're about to say doesn't contribute meaningfully to the conversation around you -- why talk?  If what's being talked about doesn't apply to you, or doesn't provide you any benefit, why participate?

I really don't think that the whole ""quiet kid"" stereotype holds any value -- I think its symptomatic of a population that just flaps their gums way too much and never really has anything meaningful to say.  

You give a lot of yourself away when you talk, you show your hand -- you allow people to make their judgments about you, assess your weaknesses, and manipulate you.  People you don't even know exist probably think you're an asshole because of one thing you said out of turn one time like 5 years ago -- and you don't even know about it, because you probably never think about the things you say or who you say them to.

Your study must be super easy! Lucky you!

What those people don't realize is that actually, you don't want to have to study 16 hours a day non-stop for every day. Yes, many claim they do cause it's cool, but most don't actually. Maybe they do work until 2 am, but you are not going to wake up again the next morning at 6 to continue your studies. And if you do run on 4 hours a sleep: that is not cool and nothing to show off with! It is super unhealthy for you, physically and mentally. So please, stop it. Promoting the stereotype of ""college student running on four hours of sleep and instant ramen"" and making a competition out of it is harmful for many.

Seriously, there are students all around the world who get mental breakdowns due to work overload. In some countries (I'm sorry for including a stereotype here but I'm going to say mostly in asian countries), students have so much pressure that they have increased rates of suicide and burn outs. In the ""western world"", making a competition out of who is the ""unhealthiest"" student staying up the latest is not good for anybody.

I don't think that I can adequately express how irritated I get when I settle down to watch an episode of a series I'm really into, and then they start bursting into song every 5 minutes. It's annoying and it's cringey. I mean they're either changing the lyrics of well known songs to fit the script, or they're singing songs that vaguely relate to what's going on in the show. Whats worse is that you can't skip the episode because often big things happen in that episode that affect the rest of the season, so I end up having to torture myself and watch it.To me, theres nothing worse than seeing ""non-broadway"" actors trying to sing and dance and look natural.

500,1598813414.0,The dating world would be better if culture supported women asking men out more than men asking out women.,"The reason for this is that women are MORE SELECTIVE.

Think about it. Whenever there is a group of people deciding what to do, it's more efficient to have the most picky person decide, since their choice is most likely to be accepted by the other members. Otherwise everyone else has to work to find something the picky person will accept, and that's excess work.

Well that's EXACTLY what happens in the dating world. Women are more picky, but rather than take in upon themselves to decide who they want to date and act upon it, they more often expect the men to come to them, creating more work overall.

Let's use numbers to illustrate. Let's say (hypothetically) that a man will agree to date 20% of women, and women will agree to date 10% of men.

In this case, if a woman is looking to date, we would expect a match after she asks out 5 men she approves of.

If instead she makes the men do all the work, we would expect a match after 10 men ask her out.

Even a hybrid is more efficient than this. If the woman asks out 2 men, 6 men asking her out in addition are then required for there to be an expected match. That's 8 attempts, which is less than 10.

Clearly, in a world where women are more selective, allocating the work to men just complicates the process. Since women are the ones who have a narrower selection of potential mates, let them decide who they want, since they have a worse chance of being turned down.",unpopularopinion

I understand times are changing and a new generation is growing but I still don't think kids should be allowed to have their own devices til they can responsibly pay for it or take care of it.

Social media can ruin the idea of growing up in a split second. YouTube, Instagram, Facebook etc can all have a positive impact on young minds teaching them things and all that, but it will mostly be negative if they use it. They will get addicted and want to watch YouTube all day and one wrong search can lead to uncomfortable conversations and things they shouldn't know until they are older. My younger brothers and cousins are watching YouTube constantly and the stuff they watch is extremely weird and in some cases scary.

Okay because apparently I have to explain this to some people like they're 5, good or bad graphics do not nessasarily mean other aspects are good or bad. But development has limited resources and I feel that if studios were to focus on other more important aspects of the games they make it would lead to a better game and experience. It doesn't matter how good your graphics are if everything else suffers from it. I got tired of playing AC Valhalla because I spent more time in loading screens than the actual game play.

As that famous quote by apparently a number of people  says:

“There are two kinds of evil people in this world. People who do evil stuff and people who see evil stuff being done and don’t try to stop it.”

Don’t be that person. 

Edit: Some of you seem to be missing that the situation I’m talking about here is where *you* are the person that the person is cheating with. I’m not talking about inserting yourself into a situation involving infidelity you had nothing to do with.

Also, it is entirely possible the person you tell may get upset with you and if that’s the case just block them and move on with your life or if you’re worried about your own safety don’t say anything. 

It helps to remember that their anger has nothing to do with you personally and is a projection because their worldview has been upended. Try not to personalize it.

Lastly, those of you proudly talking about how you don’t/wouldn’t say anything are assholes. You’d want it done for you but won’t give the same courtesy? Congratulations on being the worst kind of person and making this world just a little shittier.",unpopularopinion

1. You are very limited what's their games you can play when's the last time you played an online 3D platformer probably never I don't want to just play shooters all day I want variety.

2. There is a much better immersion in single player games in a single player game you can have a good story with beginning middle and end with a great story excellent voice acting and amazing world's to venture on your own in. I know mmos sometimes do this but other people being in my game ruin it for me.

3. I like the control if I want to go to the bathroom I can easily spot in a single player game go I can't do that online.

Sometimes the worst part about it is that it's so damn funny. And you just have to give credit where credits due. But lately I've been going to the comments expecting an informative and sincere conversation about a rather serious post only to find (yet again) another 4 pages of jokes or one drawn out and exhausted pun. Sometimes I feel like I should laugh at the cleverness of some. But it happens so often and in so many posts that I find myself never laughing at all in the comments anymore. Not unless there's just a golden moment. I've even begun to roll my eyes the moment I open the comments and see that the top comment is a joke. I NEVER ROLL MY EYES. At anything.

535,1611810218.0,I don't want to be in a relationship with someone if they watch porn.,"Now don't downvote this because you disagree, I know its an unpopular opinion, but I am genuinely uncomfortable by people watching porn while they're in a relationship with me. It honestly feels like cheating. Why would you need to get sexual gratification somewhere else when I am literally right here willing to give you all the material you could ever want? Why do you need to get that from another woman? 

I'm currently in a serious relationship and I've talked this through with my partner and he is ok with it and respects my boundaries. I am completely committed to the person I'm dating and I will only go to them for things that I deem exclusive to a romantic relationship, therefore I expect the same from them. When I masturbate I only masturbate to them and I expect the same. When I feel genuine romantic emotions, I only feel them toward them, and I expect the same. The reason being is that I am very, very serious about long term relationships and I'd feel like I was doing something very wrong if I thought of anyone else in this way.

If you've discussed it with your partner and you're both ok with porn, thats cool, but I've been pressured by multiple people in the past to act like I'm ok with it, but I just never have been. Porn is something I'm highly uncomfortable with, it makes me feel jealous and betrayed and it makes me feel like I'm not good enough. Those should be valid emotions to feel, but people try to make it seem like its irrational to feel that way when I truly believe it isn't. 

I know a lot of people feel the same way as me, just know that its ok to set boundaries in your relationship because your feelings are just as valid as your partner's. That goes for anything, really.

And them targeting everyone who doesn't have Premium with unskippable ads to try and get us to cave is pretty shameful.  

*During a pandemic that requires most of us to remain indoors, no less.*  

A better and more effective strategy would have been to give YouTube users Premium *for free* for the duration of the pandemic. This way, YouTube gets props for being a Chad and understanding that nobody wants to be stuck inside with nothing to do but game and watch internet videos, and they would probably get a bunch of people to say ""you know what? Maybe YouTube isn't so scummy after all, I think I *will* buy Premium when the pandemic is over!""

540,1552719774.0,Alcohol is one of the worst drugs and shouldn’t have the social acceptance it does.,"Alcohol is deceptively innocent especially to people that haven’t done many drugs. It slows down reaction times, clouds judgment and pretty much makes you worse at everything. In high quantities it is easily the most intoxicating substance I’ve ever consumed and can effect cognitive functioning for up to 3 days. 

There is a huge focus on how alcohol effects driving but people don’t seem to care about how it effects the rest of your their life  and we focus on driving because it requires  us to be on the ball 100% of the time and the consequences are deadly. 

I really don’t have any data to support the rest, but my personal opinion is that getting drunk more than once a week will lower IQ and job performance as well as performances on anything skill based ie.  video games, sports, music, driving, dancing etc.  over time you will become a shadow of the person you could have been if you weren’t drinking and to clarify I don’t mean a glass of wine at dinner or a single beer but anything more than a SLIGHT buzz regularly.

I recall similar experiences, like when my 7 year old cousin thought he could defeat me, a 25 year old man at the time, in a wrestling match.  Kid thought he was John Cena when he entered the ring with me, but he soon learned that he had a long way to go before he became the greatest.

Children need to be humbled in the presence of real ultimate power, not coddled and patronized.  Children need to learn that you can't be good at something by just trying it once without any practice or dedication.  I live in a generation of people who want instant gratification and are instantly discouraged from trying new things when they aren't immediately good at them.  Nobody is.  That's an important lesson to learn while growing up.

Children need to learn to admire others instead of unjustly having their egos inflated by those around them who tell them they are geniuses, kings, queens, princesses, future Kobe Bryants.  If they admire people better than they are, they will have role models.  They will learn respect, diligence, patience and to be humble in their pursuits of improvement.

If a man (especially one of Cardi B’s status) were to come on video - and go onto explain how he lured women into his hotel room - drugged them - robbed them and left. He would be locked up for life

So why isn’t Cardi getting the exact same treatment? Why isn’t anything happening? Why is she just getting a free pass?

It’s bullshit and she deserves equal treatment for her actions.

Edit:

To make more clear. I understand u can’t incriminilaize someone without any actual evidence. But for example

Drake

He gets on camera and admits to drugging and robbing multiple women. What do u think would happen to his career or life? It would be completely ruined. He would probably end up having an investigation on him as well. 

But Cardi?

Oh no no no - this woman is perfectly clean and can get away with literally anything

Edit 2:

People seem to think I want her in jail - not necessarily. 

I understand that just because she said she did it - does not make her automatically guilty but again and maybe the title is a bit misleading on this but-

She should be TREATED appropriately. Or at the very least it should be more achknowledged and not just glossed over by her fan base and a large sum of people. 

I don’t really give a shit about her in terms of getting arrested or put in jail. I just want her to experience the same reapercussions that a male or maybe even another female would get from going on camera in 2018/2019 whenever it was - and then stating how u drugged and robbed men/women. 

Maybe 15 years ago u could get away with this - but with 2019’s cancel culture insanity I find it insane that this hasn’t been brought up when discussing Cardi - all that is brought up is 

“Omg queeeeen okrrrrrrrrrrrrr such a racial role model and figure!!!!!”

If I contended this in public, I'd get mowed down by angry reprimands and disappointed looks. But from an objective and statistical standpoint, it's nonsensical to give a flying fuck about school shootings. Here's why.

&#x200B;

**1,153.** That's how many people have been killed in school shootings since 1965, per [The Washington Post.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/mass-shootings-in-america/?utm_term=.094b0180ee3a) This averages out to approximately **23 deaths per year** attributable to school shootings. Below are some other contributing causes of death, measured in annual confirmed cases.

1. **68 - Terrorism.** Let's compare school shootings to my favorite source of wildly disproportionate panic: terrorism. Notorious for being emphatically overblown after 2001, terrorism claimed 68 deaths on United States soil in 2016. This is **three times as many** deaths as school shootings. [Source](https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death)
2. **3,885 - Falling.** Whether it be falling from a cliff, ladder, stairs, or building (unintentionally), falls claimed 3,885 US lives in 2011. The amount of fucks I give about these preventable deaths are equivalent to moons orbiting around Mercury. So why, considering a framework of logic and objectivity, should my newsfeed be dominated by events which claim **169 times less** lives than falling?   [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/06/deaths-mortality-rates-cause-death-2011)
3. **80,058 - Diabetes.** If you were to analyze relative media exposure of diabetes against school shootings, the latter would dominate by a considerable margin. Yet, despite diabetes claiming 80,000 more lives annually (**3480 : 1 ratio**), mainstream media remains fixated on overblowing the severity of school shootings. [Source](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2017/019.pdf)

&#x200B;

And, just for fun, here's some wildly unlikely shit that's **more likely to kill you** than being shot up in a school.

* **Airplane/Spacecraft Crash** \- 26 deaths
* **Drowning in the Bathtub** \- 29 deaths
* **Getting Struck by a Projectile** \- 33 deaths
* **Pedestrian Getting Nailed by a Lorry** \- 41 deaths
* **Accidentally Strangling Yourself -** 116 deaths

&#x200B;

Now, here's a [New York Times Article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/20/us/school-shootings-drills-risks.html) titled ""*New Reality for High School Students: Calculating the Risk of Getting Shot.*"" Complete with a picture of an injured student, this article insinuates that school shootings are common enough to warrant serious consideration. Why else would you need to calculate the risk of it occurring? What it conveniently leaves out, however, is the following (excerpt from the [Washington Post:](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/school-shootings-are-extraordinarily-rare-why-is-fear-of-them-driving-policy/2018/03/08/f4ead9f2-2247-11e8-94da-ebf9d112159c_story.html?utm_term=.c7e601c50733))

>That means the statistical likelihood of any given public school student being killed by a gun, in school, on any given day since 1999 was **roughly 1 in 614,000,000**. And since the 1990s, shootings at schools have been getting less common. The chance of a child being shot and killed in a public school is extraordinarily low.

In percentages, the probability of a randomly-selected student getting shot tomorrow is 0.00000000016%.

595,1622222478.0,There should be “Adults Only” apartment buildings,"UPDATE 6/12- the children have been removed from the apartment. To everyone calling me a “male Karen” and accused me of being a bad person for calling CPS; fuck you. Those kids **were** being abused, and are living with a different person (can’t give away any more info than that. All that matters is that they’re gone and safe).

The parents were arrested as well, since they were using hard drugs and giving them to their kids. Their lease has been dropped, and the landlord let my wife and I move into their old unit since it’s on the top floor. Now that we’ve actually caught up on our sleep, we aren’t snapping at each other constantly and can enjoy the view from our new unit. 

This was a very interesting post, and the replies went everywhere from “This isn’t unpopular” to “this is the 20th time I’ve seen this concept in a week” to “you are a terrible person who wants all babies to die” to “I made terrible choices and now they’ve come back to haunt me and it’s your fault for discriminating against people with children”. I didn’t knock you up, I didn’t force you to keep it, go find some mommy club to complain to or whatever the hell it is you do- just don’t do it around me. 

To those of you with children, teach them to use their inside voices, and understand that the world won’t stop turning because little Timmy’s having a tantrum. You and you alone are responsible for your offspring, try to raise them into decent people. Also, don’t bring your kid to adults only places. Or post them on the internet. There are dangerous creepers online, and putting photos and videos of them up is dangerous. The entire world doesn’t need to see little “K8lynn” singing into a hairbrush. Nobody except for you and your family is interested in seeing that. 


ORIGINAL POST

MSTOP TELLING ME ABOUT SENIOR RETIREMENT VILLAGES. I AM 34, NOT 50. I CANNOT MOVE INTO ONE FOR ANOTHER 16 YEARS. WE CANNOT AFFORD A HOUSE. WE’RE SAVING FOR ONE. WE HAVE REPORTED THE FAMILY TO THE LANDLORD AND CPS. 

My wife and I got some new upstairs neighbors recently. They were a bit loud moving in, but we figured that they were just trying to unpack as quickly as possible to get settled in. We brought them a basket of baked goods- and were promptly told by the lady of the house “I hope you guys are good with noise. We have 6 kids under the age of 8.” 

They’ve been here for a month. We have not slept for a month. They scream at one another all hours of the day and night, run and jump super loudly, and are just generally annoying. Evidently, they like the sound of our doorbell and will press it repeatedly to the point where we decided to take the batteries out. 

We’ve filed several noise complaints, only to be told “They’re kids. What do you expect?” Considering that we’re paying nearly $2000 in rent per month, we were expecting at least some peace and quiet. 

If there were an adults only apartment building with no children allowed, that would be amazing.

Edit to add: No one under the age of 18 would be allowed to move in. Should any resident get pregnant and decide to have the child, they will be moved to a child friendly complex owned by the same company. (Original wording was vague) It’s literally one building for people without kids, and one for people with them. They would have 3 months to vacate their current apartment and move into the child friendly block. 

This is a hypothetical situation. 

And yes, I know retirement communities exist. My wife and I are in our 30’s. We don’t qualify yet. We actually like kids- it’s the fact that kids are very poorly behaved now and we want to have at least *some* peace and quiet. For those of you with children, good for you- just raise them to be aware of the noise they make and try to shape them into respectful and kind little humans. 

Last edit: I can’t believe this tiny germ of an unpopular opinion managed to make it on the front page. Whether or not you agree, the point is moot. My wife and I have decided to spend the weekend at my parents house to get some space from our neighbors. The stress that we’ve been going through with these neighbors is intense. 

We’re planning to move out once our lease is up and will be looking into getting a top-floor unit. We live in America, so this child free building couldn’t exist here. I know that and I wanted to see if people were interested in something like that. We called CPS because we think the kids are being abused, not because of the noise. They show a lot of signs of neglect, despite the fact that the parents are home nearly all the time.

598,1595410749.0,There is nothing wrong with finding other people attractive when in a relationship but you’re an asshole if you feel the need to continuously tell your partner about it.,"Recently people have been saying how fucked up it is if you have a celebrity crush while others have said that being attracted to such people is 100% normal. 

While I agree that finding other people attractive is just a part of being human it becomes concerning if you feel the need to continuesly tell your partner this. Obviously I don’t know how your relationship works so maybe you and your partner have a bond over talking about who you find attractive. However, if you are in a closed relationship with someone I don’t see what the point of telling them that you find someone else attractive is, just keep it to yourself. For example, if you see someone on the street and think they look cute why would you tell your partner about how cute they look? Or if you have a celebrity crush on an attractive celebrity, why won’t you just have that fantasy in your head, what will telling your partner who probably doesn’t compare to that celebrity do? 

There’s nothing they can really do with that information, to me it just seems like a way to try and get a reaction out of someone or to see if they’d get jealous or not. If you don’t get jealous by that stuff that’s great and shows that you are confident in yourself, however, if you do get jealous by this stuff there’s nothing wrong with you for doing so, they should keep their fantasies to themself. 

TL;DR - it’s 100% natural to find other people attractive in a relationship but feeling the need to continuously tell your partner who you find attractive is an asshole move.

Edit- I thought this was unpopular due to the amount of people saying “they won’t meet the celebrity anyways so it doesn’t matter” In [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/htwlkc/its_lowkey_rude_af_to_be_so_blatantly_in_love/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

603,1545514444.0,Trying to force someone into Atheism is just as bad as trying to force someone into Christianity.,"I am one of those Atheists who doesn't care what religion people around me practice. I would honestly rather just let people be. I don't think I am more intelligent or better than people who do religion. I have been seeing several threads on Reddit calling everyone who has done religion ""dumb"", ""detached from reality"", etc. Albert Einstein was a Jew, does being an Atheist automatically make us more intelligent than him? No.

And it also makes me cringe when Atheists try to force religious people into Atheism. If we are going to strongly condemn Christians trying to force others into Christianity, we should condemn Atheists trying to force Atheism on to other people.

If it doesn't affect you, just let people be.

Edit: Thanks for bringing Einstein to my attention, with him being ethnically Jewish, growing up in a Jewish family, but not really believing in it too much himself. That being said, intelligent and accomplished people who are religious, do obviously exist. Isaac Newton, someone who was gifted with math but extremely anti-social, was a devout (un-orthodox) Christian. If you don't want to use scientists as an example, James Madison, who wrote the Bill of Rights that is idolized by many, was also Christian.

612,1544873437.0,There needs to be a small dick acceptance movement before I even begin to give a shit about Fat acceptance for women.,"Perhaps this isnt an unpopular opinion, but I'm a bi man who hasn't ever gotten with another man but I talk to gay men a lot. (I've never engaged with it for my own personal reasons but that's besides the point)

I don't think many women realize how fucking horrible it is for a man to have a small dick. How emasculating it is to be judged solely on something that you have absolutely no control over. My size isn't great either but I've come to accept it, however, I know many men who simply can't and most women and society at large do **nothing** to support a person with a small dick. 

When I see all the normal shit about fat acceptance or otherwise loving women no matter what size they are, I laugh because they can fucking *change* their size. A man can't. A woman can get larger breasts, a man can't increase his size. Why should I focus my energy on making those who can change their situation or otherwise in the case of fat people **put themselves in the situation to begin with** feel more comfortable about themselves while those who can't do **anything** to help their situation aren't even fucking mentioned in the mainstream until it's convenient.

The rise in hookup culture is only doing more harm. Many men can't stack up, what's considered ""average"" size is in many cases thought of as small. While it's taboo to shame a woman for their body, small dick jokes seem as if they are completely fair game and the hypocrisy is absolutely disgusting to me.

Edit: as an addendum, I'd like to also take the time to bitch about men with bigger dicks. 

All I can say is fuck most of you. You treat your smaller brothers like shit most of the time. Thinking you're fucking special or you did something to earn your sexual prowess, fuck off. It was luck of the God damn draw you should be getting on your knees and thanking whatever cosmic force responsible for bestowing your prowess unto you. While the rest of the population has to carefully disclose their size to every partner, wondering in the back of their mind if they *truly* don't care. Even though I accept my size (it's about 5 and a half inches) I know I could have it a lot worse and many men do. I still have it in the back of my mind that whoever I'm with isn't actually satisfied with my size like they say they are. I'm glad you fucks don't ever have to deal with that because I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy to be honest. 

**Edit 2: I would like to address some comments and common replies and also give a brief overview of my thoughts thus far.**

I didn't think this was going to blow up like it did. I'm glad it did to be honest because it really put some things in perspective for me. 

Firstly I'd like to address this ludicrous notion that I hate women. I dont know how I can prove to any of you that I dont hate women other than me saying I dont. I may have used harsh words but my words were not to disparage any one group just for existing. My problem was purely with the double standards, with the non-inclusion of men in the mainstream body positive movement. 

I understand and agree that fat acceptance is something we should be concerned about. No one *should* be made to feel horrible about themselves based on their body by other people. My main point was I believe we should be striving for an all inclusive body positive movement that encompasses everyone from burn victims to people with major deformaties, to men and women whom have insecurities. **I never said one couldn't have a fat positive movement.** (despite my disagreements with it due to the unhealthy side effects encouraging obesity can lead to but that's besides the point) I simply *longed for an all inclusive body positive movement* to be pushed just as much if not more than the fat acceptance movement. I get that caring about one thing within a movement doesnt necessarily negate your concern for other issues. But from where I'm sitting it doesnt seem like a lot of men get the same amount of support for their body issues by comparison of women. Perhaps that's just my confirmation bias, and if that's the case I apologize and acknowledge my fault. And before anyone addresses it, I'm not even necessarily advocating for a small dick movement despite the title. That was mostly just for flair and to discuss the notion of body positive movements not including men, and I used penis size as an example. What I really want is inclusivity. Of everyone. 

Another topic I'd like to address is the idea that ""women can't hide the fact that they're fat, men dont broadcast their dick size so it's not as much of a daily struggle by comparison of fat people."" While I understand the logic, I dont really see how its productive. Sexual relationships is a *huge* part of humanity as a whole. Many of us crave it, strive for it. Make it the focus of our daily lives in some cases whether we want to or not. When a person feels inadequate about themselves this can have **major** implications on a persons psyche. If left untreated it can have damaging effects on ones personality and mental state which ultimately harms them on the day to day. I understand that's not a healthy way to go about it, they should be seeking help themselves. But I feel many men are discouraged from talking about it, it's made out to be as if it doesn't matter. Which is why I'm encouraging an all inclusive body positive movement. But I feel the main point those who say this are trying to make is that there's more pressure put on society to accept ones outward appearance that is visible to the naked eye. And I agree with that, but all I'm really saying is we should be reaching higher. 

I obviously can't be the judge of my own character, but I believe I'm a bit of an idealist. For better or worse, I sincerely believe humanity coming together as a whole is not only possible, but necessary for humanity to advance in any meaningful way. Whether it was your intent or not, having a body positive movement that is pushed in the mainstream that is only really geared towards supporting one group can lead to feelings of neglect for another. 

Another topic that was brought up was about my abrasiveness. Many thought I was an asshole in my post and I would agree with that. I admit I'm a bit of a douchebag but that's why I dont want to be the one ""leading the charge"" so to speak. Many suggested that I should start the movement myself, but I'm simply not the right person for the job. I'm hot headed, I sometimes don't think before I speak and many people tend to vehemently disagree with my opinions. I'm a private person, despite how I am online with anonymity, in real life I am a bit of a hermit and have horrible anxiety when placed in uncomfortable positions. I also dont feel it would even be taken seriously given the replies. I see posts of people posting this post on other subs to bitch about it. ""r/unpopularopinion where white men go to whine about shit no one cares about."" I knew there would be opposition to this post and I was prepared for it, but some of the replies honestly make me feel like shit. Perhaps rightly so, because I'm a bit of a dick. But love me or hate me, I stand by most of what I said. 

I sincerely hope that if you take away anything from this, it's that we shouldnt be focusing on advancing one particular group. Supporting one particular group. (Culturally speaking I'm not talking about specific diseases or aggretious physical phenomena) I care about people despite what many of you may believe. And all I really want is peace and acceptance of everybody. (Aside from douchebags who think they're better than everyone else i.e in regards to the first edit about people who flaunt their bigger dicks)

The last major point I'd like to address is many people believe me to be insecure. Somehow me being insecure invalidates the very real lack of support for males in this department. I'll admit that sure, I wish I had a bigger dick. I feel a bit shitty about it at times but for the most part I can tolerate it. I've had partners who didn't care and I genuinely believe them. I know they're out there it's just a matter of finding them. So you can call me an insecure whiny little bitch all you want but you're only proving my point.  

One last thing is I really do appreciate the discussion. There are a lot of points I strongly disagree with that I didn't address here, and there are many ideas I really should think over and reevaluate myself. And I thank  everyone for giving me the opportunity.",unpopularopinion

""But 10 is a cool number and is essential for almost everything"" you might say. Absolute bollocks. I can write an essay about how bad 10 is but to keep it relatively short, the only reason 10 is considered special is because we follow the base 10 decimal number system. It has just this one thing going on for it. But guess what, base 10 is a horrendous way to count, there are many superior versions like base 12 and base 6 that are easy to learn and more viable, especially when doing division. Also finger counting is better in base 6, so please don't spread your humans have ten fingers propaganda.


Yes, I know. The metric system and all existing documentation are in base 10. But that's just one of the ways Big Decimal shills are manipulating you. Do you really want to use a bad number system just because ""It has always been like that""? What is this if not Stockholm Syndrome? If you don't want to become a mere statistic it's high time you stand up for yourself.



TL;DR - I loathe how the number 10 is glorified and admired by people.



Edit: Yes I know it is not intuitive to count in other bases, but thats just because you have been accustomed to decimal. Analogous to language, it is hard to pick up a new one.


Also, I am aware the metric system will get destroyed if we change the base. That's not the point. If we had chosen a different base at inception then metric system, math and day to day life would have evolved with it, making that version of counting just as intuitive as decimal.",unpopularopinion

625,1598980883.0,The reason kids spend their days in front of a screen is because you've fucked up all alternative forms of entertainment,"People often tend to blame the technology itself when complaining about ""kids these days"" spending all their time with their phones, consoles, and so on. But I don't think videogames and Youtube are something like the ultimate form of entertainment. They're great and I love them, sure, but I don't think they're that addictive or ""special"" to get all of a kid's interest by themselves (after all, kids get bored by everything really soon, don't they?)

Let's look at alternative, more ""traditional"" forms of entertainment. I'm only 28 and I can already see how much they've changed. I used to ride my bike all day long since I was 6 or 7 years old, now it's too dangerous for some reason and many kids will only be allowed to do it while the parents are watching. Same for going to the pool or river for a swim. Feel like playing some football? Well, a drop of rain fell two hours ago so no way! Even just for going to the park! There used to be almost no parents there unless their oldest kid was something like 5 years old. Now there are more parents that children! And there's yet another problem. In some areas, there are just no other children around perhaps in dozens of kilometres!

The most drastic example: I used to have play fights with my siblings, cousins, friends and classmates all the time, sometimes even in front of my parents! Sometimes even the parents were cheering!! I'm not saying that's necessarely a good thing, but it's unthinkable only a couple of decades later. And don't even get me started on fighting in the water (which I've probably done like a million times)!

But these are just examples... I have a few reasons to believe I'm right about this ""helicopter-parenting"" being the reason behind kids loving their phones so much:

\- First, in an era of videogames with graphics and playability that we wouldn't even dream of not that long ago, you'd expect things like chess to be almost disappearing. Well, chess is stronger than eve. Whether in my town, my country or my planet, the number of kids playing chess tournaments does not stop to grow.

\- Also, at least in my experience, this trend had started way before things like social media were mainstream. Already by the time I was 12 or so I noticed kids younger than me spent a lot of time watching TV (and I wasn't the only one)

\- And finally, just compare different types of parents, the rules they put, and what their children do. Think of those two annoying bored kids in a family dinner. If parents force them to stay at the table give them a tablet, they'll be on the tablet, but what if they are allowed to leave?

**NOTE:** The points I'm making here are strongly region-dependent and may not apply to your particular country or society. I'll use my own as a reference and if the situation in yours is wildly different, I'd love to hear about that contrast in the comments.

**ANOTHER NOTE**: I wanted the title to say ""we've fucked up"" rather than ""you've"". I was going to copy/paste, rewrite the title and post again but there were already some comments so I'll leave it as it is so you can see that I'm dumb",unpopularopinion

Are you ever going to use the quadratic formula in the future? 99% the answer to this question is a no. However, mathematics is not about applying specifically what you learn in the class, but more so about applying the problem solving abilities that you develop through solving math problems. You have A,B, and C... now how can you get to D? It’s all about critical thinking. This type of critical thinking is important to develop so that later on in life when you need to think hard about a problem and derive a solution, you’re not completely inexperienced with this type of thinking.

Edit: some of you still don’t get it. “When will I factor polynomials by hand” - YOU WONT. But the process of solving difficult math problems, thinking in new ways, and making this a habit of yours is what will help to increase your critical thinking skills - just something to constantly engage your head in so you don’t spend an entire child hood staring at a screen and growing up to become useless and achieve nothing because you have fucked your brain up from a very apparent underwhelming use of it during its development stage.

Edit 3: If you think agreeing with this makes you superior and that people who disagree with this idea are losers... you’re part of the issue here

Edit 4: I know there are other ways to improve critical thinking skills, but each core subject approaches it through a different avenue. When you’re reading the classics, which people also hate to do in school, you’re taking the time to understand the archaic prose that was used in these books, you are recognizing the characters motivations, you are trying to figure out what emotions they are feeling - all subconsciously. This type of critical thinking is different from the type used in math where it is a more strict use of logical statements to get from point A to point B. Training your brain to do well in each arena is well worth it. 

If you’re a STEM major and you think you’re superior because you can solve fancy math equations or write a cool program... you’re not. So many programmers are totally inadequate at for example describing their vision for a future project, selling their idea, etc. - reading some books would help with that!

And because they are a bunch of twats whose publicity stunts irreversibly damaged a UNESCO Heritage Site and caused the deaths of millions because of their crusade against DDT.

They personify everything wrong with the environmental movement. They have essentially killed every viable strategy we have to combat our impact on the environment in the eyes of the public and ruined the perception of the movement as a whole. They are the reason we aren't doing jackshit about climate change, because their anti-science activism has ruined the reputation of every technology that could yield the most results.

Edit #1: A slight correction on the DDT point. It was only banned worldwide in 2001, but is still used in small quantities to combat large infestations of mosquitoes. It was also linked to several health defects in humans and animals. However, it doesn't change the fact that malaria kills 3000 children every day and that DDT is still the most effective way to combat it, at least in reasonable doses.

654,1580245114.0,Psuedo-science is much more dangerous than religion in our current timeline.,"When scientific jargon is adopted by people who use it to push a narrative, it becomes almost indistinguishable from actual science to the general public.

For example, take the idea that an increase in solar output is the main cause of climate change. This is psuedo-science nonsense that has no basis in scientific reality yet to the naked eye, non peer reivewed studies claiming this to be the case can be very convincing. 

I have no idea how lies that use scientific jargon can actually be combated due to just how many people don't have time in their day to fact check what they hear.

For another instance, I know multiple people that became convinced that 1 volcano eruption put more co2 into the atmosphere than all of man made emissions combined just a couple years ago.

That's not even jargon, that's a basic ass meme and it had an effect on people I knew.

658,1602799725.0,Servers/Waitresses rarely deserve 15-20% tips for each table.,"Let’s see if this sub is actually about unpopular opinions. 

My SO is a waitress at a local diner. She gets her tables that tip well, and some that don’t (or not at all). I see posts on Reddit every single day complaining about people who don’t tip or tip smaller than the regular 15% (or what I’m seeing lately is that “standard tip” trending more towards 20%). I don’t advocate for not tipping your waitress. He/she is providing a service to you: they deserve compensation. But 20%? 

When it’s all said and done, my SO makes more money than I do as a waitress and I work in a very specialized field with several years training. This isn’t me complaining about my salary, cause I do pretty well myself. And don’t get me wrong, when she comes home with $200+ in just tips after a short shift, I’m super happy for her. 

Here’s where my unpopular opinion comes in. No waitress at a regular restaurant should be expecting 20%, even 15% from their tables unless they’re giving us damn back rubs while serving. A 4 person table at a reasonably priced restaurant can run you $70-$100. I don’t feel that they earn their $20 tip (ie 20%) by simply bringing drinks at the beginning, slapping plates on the table, and bringing my bill.

When my coworker’s dog died, he got a day off.

Pets are pets and life is life. Cats can be family members just as much as dogs can but they don’t get nearly as much love. It pisses me off.

Edit:
Little backstory:

My wife and I can’t have a second child due to complications during the first pregnancy.

Our son, now five, was really sad he couldn’t have a brother or sister when he was about three. He kept asking for a cat, so thats what we got for our family.

We found Mellow, a fully grey (blue) ragdoll. We took him home when he was seven weeks old. He became instant friends with our son and was basically his protector. When we were outside at the playground, Mellow was there to keep watch. He slept on the rug by his bed or on the covers. When my son would take out the trash, Mellow would escort him. When our son went to a friends house to play, Mellow would wait for at least half an hour by the friends’ door.

He got hit by a car on Saturday. Without going in too much detail: the street is still covered in blood.

He wasn’t even two years old.

I made a post on r/rant condemning the driver that hit Mellow. I got a lot of negative and personal responses which I couldn’t handle anymore so I deleted the post.

\- The other thing is: I have to admit that this post was rushed. And yes, I am quite inconsiderate in it (for reference see my content below and some of my replies).

I don't regret what I wrote (it was a start for a good lesson) but reading through some well thought-out opinions my self-reflection started to operate. Some of you made the assumption that I must not have a lot of experience regarding relationships. That's right. And sometimes I turn into this arrogant person who likes to believe she knows it all (btw I'm female for those who thought otherwise). The reactions are just as harsh as my statement but it's okay. I can understand that what I said can be an effective method in some relationships  (that's great) and cannot be applied in others (which is also valid). And at the end I'm the one who should have stayed more flexible. I should have considered more factors. I want to apologize about that honestly. So thank you all for responding and expressing your viewpoints, now I'll have a lot to think about and a lot to work on. I'm not afraid to face judgement if that's what people feel like giving me based on my content. So thank you for offering the experience. I appreciate both the agreements and disagreements.

Honesty is NOT kindness. Honesty is honesty. Period. I don’t mean you have to be cruel about it but you shouldn’t put honesty aside in favor of toning serious things down. You can be honest and respectful and showing care without being overly soft towards your partner. If you can’t take it well, the problem is you and not the other person. And yes, it is applicable to those who have mental health issues, too.

You can’t just tiptoe around a topic that is basically one of the most essential founding-factors of a (sexual) relationship.

Your partner should be able to freely speak his/her mind (again respectfully and kindly enough which is still not too “soft”) - and how you react to that is YOUR responsibility. The partner doesn’t have to just accept the fact you gained weight just because it’s a sensitive topic to you. I wonder why it’s so sensitive…

Depending on how baggy they are, they can feel really good around your ankles. I personally prefer swimming in baggy jeans but skinnies work well too. They (the skinny jeans) are also more fun to take off when they’re soaking wet. 

Also, when your jeans are soaked, they’re heavier. It’s always leg day when your jeans are wet. 

If you haven’t tried swimming in baggy jeans I suggest doing so. It will change your life.

684,1669538876.0,American weddings are an expensive vanity party and a terrible tradition,"$50k average for a wedding? Why would any couples except the wealthy still host large ceremonies? Unless your family and guests are gifting cash generously, a wedding ceremony is a terrible financial decision and a stressful way to start a marriage. Is how well you two plan one event together any indication of a life partnership? 

I’ve personally never been that excited about watching friends or cousins get married. They could just show me pictures of an elopement, and I’d be equally happy for them. 

How did expensive ceremonies become the norm? I understand formally announcing marriages for families of influence, but most of us don’t fall into that category. 

Edit: I was misinformed. The average is around $25-30k. The median is around $15k. 

I am not against all weddings or saying they aren’t fun. I am against expensive weddings being a cultural norm. I’ve seen friends go into consumer debt after debt to “follow the steps.” An inexpensive ring, an inexpensive celebration, an inexpensive honeymoon all seem like the responsible thing to do for many couples, but our culture normalizes having fancy decor and fancy dinners and open bars when most friends and family would be happy to celebrate on lawn chairs.",unpopularopinion

687,1549668509.0,"90% of beauty standards women feel are enforced by other women, not men","It's crazy to me that there's so much talk about toxic masculinity, but toxic femininity is ingrained in our society and no one bats an eye. 

Cosmo, vogue, fashion shows, reality t.v. Who is really perpetuating the unattainable standards for women to be skinny, to have matching outfits, to wear loads of makeup and possess flashy jewelry. Most guys, in my experience, never complain or even notice shit like that. But every woman I have known talks shit behind other girl's backs or to their face. And a lot of these are impressionable, young girls that drive so much toxicity. 

And if we're talking about gender standards, there has been a huge reverse in standards against men in the last decade. If men even desire a woman to be in shape or presentable, there's an uproar of sexism. But most women are able to have a laundry list of expectations for men and it goes unchecked. Its ludicrous.

TL;DR: Women have unnecessary beauty standards placed on them but it has nothing to do with men. This is toxic femininity and it's dangerous. Sorry this was so long.

Edit: Okay obviously I didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did so I would like to clarify some things. 

1. This thread was not made to bash women whatsoever. I have no control over the comments made here or if they misconstrued my original point. People who are using this as a platform to ridicule women are doing the exact opposite of having a civil debate.

2. I am simply drawing attention to the fact that we as males are told constantly why we are perpetuating toxic masculinity. But there are huge examples of toxic femininity in our society and this is one of them.

3. People refuting this with facts or having a civil discussion, thank you. Those calling me mysogynistic or saying this post is a circle jerk, I think it's important to look outside your bias and see maybe women have A LOT to work on if they want to strive for a less toxic society. It starts with themselves, calling for women to be held accountable is not mysogynistic.",unpopularopinion

689,1569897145.0,My faith in humanity isn’t restored when I see something like the bullied girl with a disability wins homecoming queen. Call me cynical but it really feels like an ego boost for the people who voted for her. Disabled people and bullied people aren’t your charity case.,"You see it all over social media and the news, headlines that read, “There are still good people in this world. She was bullied for her disability but her classmates voted her for prom queen.” or “Star basketball players stands up for his bullied classmate”. Sure it seems sweet at first but when I think about it all I can see is someone doing something “nice” for their own personal gain. When these stories make the news, who usually gets the most publicity? Who gets the interviews and good press? Why, the people who did the “good deed” of course. Most of the time it seems like they don’t give a damn about the person who they did something “nice” for, instead it’s about “Look what WE did! WE are so nice! WE are so good hearted!” It’s all about making themselves feel better when they go to sleep at night, it’s almost never about the person it should be about. It’s not sweet and heartwarming, it’s almost sort of heartbreaking because I’ve seen instances where people will do “nice things” for someone because they take pity on the person and it makes them look good in the eyes of others, but go right back to treating that same person like shit as soon as nobody else is paying attention. It was never about being nice and genuine, it was all a big ego boost. If you want to do something nice do it when nobody’s looking and don’t accept any congratulations for your good deed.

ETA: like i said in a reply to a commenter, Sure its a “nice thing to do” and in some cases it makes the disabled person feel good and it’s a nice gesture all around, BUT disabled people aren’t mindless angel pets. They have brains and lots of them don’t like to feel pitied or patronized. Especially when that pity is superficial and the people who give her those pity votes will go right back to ignoring or bullying the disabled person. I’m not saying “Don’t ever be nice because people could misconstrue your motives” I am saying, however, that you should be mindful of your actions and be careful not to make people feel patronized and pitied. Also if you’re gonna do something nice for someone make sure you’re being genuine be consistent with your actions towards someone. Don’t be nice one day and then cruel the next. I know that all good deeds are a little selfish and that’s not my main issue here. The motive isn’t the issue either, it’s the fact that people see others who happen to have a disability as nothing more than a sad little animal to feel sorry for. Instead of mistreating someone, doing one “nice” thing either because you feel sorry for them or you want wholesomeness clout or both, and then going right back to treating that person like shit; you could be genuine in the first place and treat them like any other human being and maybe even develop a true friendship with them. My issue is the publicity and praise people get for being insincere and inconsistent. I really don’t give that much of a shit about “prom queen” or shit like that anyway, I’m using it as an example. I’m almost 20 years old and when I was younger I never ran for those positions anyhow. Another example could be, like people in the comments said, giving a homeless guy $90 and filming it to post on youtube. Instead of patronizing the guy, maybe hire him to help you wash your car or do some yard work and then pay him for his labor. That way he won’t feel pitiful and have such low self esteem. Make him feel like he’s not a helpless invalid.",unpopularopinion

The reason is some allegedly racist drawings of Japanese people (more excuses have been brought forth, but I'm focusing in the Japanese issue). 

What the sanctimonious cancelmob is ignorant of is that Seuss belonged to the WWII generation, where many Americans were anti-Japanese (*not* anti-Asian) and many if not most Japanese were anti-American. Virulently so. This was entirely expected, as the two countries were at war with each other. And in fact, both governments actively encouraged such attitudes -- the enemy must be dehumanized in war, as we all know.

Yes, Seuss drew a few propaganda caricatures of the Japanese. And in the same period, the Japanese committed heinous war crimes against American POWs, including [murdering 40% of American prisoners of war](https://time.com/3334677/pow-world-war-two-usa-japan/) in violation of Japanese law and the Geneva Conventions. For reference, less than 1% of American POWs died at the hands of the *Nazis*. 

Now they're chill, but in WWII the Japanese were bloodthirsty, monstrous mass murderers of POWs and civilians alike. They murdered 40 times more American prisoners of war than the fucking *Nazis*. And they refuse to apologize for it to this day.

717,1560915044.0,Paternity tests should be a routine procedure required by law at birth.,"There are plenty of women who would be offended if their partner asked for a paternity test. A lot of men become trapped by this and only discover a child is not theirs many years after the fact. 

When a woman gives birth, there is also bound to be a man in the equation who now has to decide if he is going to raise this child or not. When making this decision, it should be a man's right to know without a shadow of a doubt whether he is the biological father of the child or not.

Adverts - those perfume adverts for one. Why the hell does a perfume require two half naked people in bed and the man smelling the pillow as the girl struts off? Another example, in the UK, an advert for being bikini body ready was removed from the Underground for being too sexy. It was on a massive wall on the station platform.

TV - Too Hot to Handle is my bugbear for this one right now. A bunch of sexy adults being told not to have sex for a cash prize and acting like it's the worst thing in the world. Also, reality tv in general has become about sexiness. The Kardashians, for one.

Music - The sheer number of inappropriate music videos is scary, not to mention the performances on stage.

The extent of sexualisation is profound. So much so that I think we as a Western culture have become used to it. I have a friend from Sri Lanka. When he came to the UK, he said that there was so much sexualisation that he was initially overwhelmed and was looking for sex everywhere.

I really hope that in the future, we realise that we've exploited ourselves and our youth. I hope there's time to change.

728,1638188198.0,"Issues like homelessness and ""world hunger"" exist for no reasons other than pure apathy and selfishness. The fact that they exist at all is proof society has failed in it's most basic function.","There is enough money in the world to easily feed and house every single person on Earth. With all of the wealth currently being hoarded, the haves could *very easily* provide for the have-nots.

So why don't they? The most common answer I see is something along the lines of ""handouts will make people lazy and the no one will want to work."" I wholeheartedly believe that anyone who says this has never experienced poverty a day in their life. To believe that the *majority of poor people* would be content to scrape by on the bare minimum for the rest of their lives is absurd. The underlying message to this argument is essentially saying that the answer to poverty is for poor people to just ""stop being poor.""

It's as if some people think being poor is a choice. They absolve themselves of guilt by saying that poor people can stop being poor whenever they want if they just stop being lazy. Yes, they can just manifest mental health, a support system of friends and family, clean clothes, access to proper hygiene, a balanced diet, and reliable transportation--they just have to want it bad enough! Absolutely asinine.

The truth is we HAVE the money. We just collectively choose not to help because most of us have decided that it's not our problem.

""It doesn't affect me personally so who cares.""

""Those people made their choice.""

""They're probably criminals/addicts anyway.""

Sentiments like this go against the very point of society: to collectively benefit from co-existence. Ten people living together in a community will thrive exponentially better than if they lived individually. This is because each person has something they can contribute to the overall good of the collective. So it is worth it for the other 9 to occasionally help out the 1 who is facing temporary adversity. The problem is that, at some point, we all decided that homeless people were worthless and that it wasn't worth it to help them. We decided that society would go on just fine without the poorest among us, so why bother wasting resources on helping them?

We've dehumanized poor people to the point that we are no more concerned about their well-being than we are about wild animals. In fact, I'd say most people are more likely to care about abandoned cats & dogs than they are about the homeless. Because those people ""chose"" to be homeless, but stray animals are merely innocent victims.",unpopularopinion

I really don't understand why, especially considering most of them end up sounding like popcorn machines or toy cars. Most newer cars don't even naturally have that ""roar"" to them, so you're basically trying to squeeze water from a stone when you try to make them sound like an older car.

Motorcycles are especially bad, as it honestly just sounds like ear-splitting flatulence, and the only good use for that is when those bands of motorcycle riders went to military funerals and revved their motors to drown out the hateful chants of Westboro Baptist Church. Other than that, it's just a grating way of saying ""hey, look at me"" that doesn't end up making you look cool so much as it just makes you a nuisance. Don't act surprised if someone gives you a dirty look or yells ""shut up"" at you or something like that, cause you really deserve it if you go around revving your overly-loud noise bike just for the heck of it.

Obviously emergency vehicles are an exception, but that's so you can hear them coming and get out of the way. If your vehicle sounds cool by nature, you don't need to make them super loud to make yourself look cool. In the process of doing that second thing, you just end up making yourself into a nuisance.

Telling students this ingrains, for the rest of their life, complacency and disregard for the world around them. 

Math and science classes don’t always have direct application, no, but calling them useless because of that is a naive oversimplification. These classes teach critical thinking. These classes teach problem solving. These classes teach our students *how* to think about things. 

I understand the benefit in telling a student that is struggling in math class that he/she is not destined to be a failure because of it. But that is totally separate from “bragging” (especially around young people) that you don’t use math in your career (even though you probably do even if you don’t realize it). That is being a bad influence on a very easily influenced population of people. 

Math is money. Science is life. You don’t have to be a rocket scientist for these things to be important. And just because you fix air conditioners or sell cars for a living doesn’t mean you are absolved of them.

She said something like “I’m not sure if they got the roles cuz they’re good AND female or just because of the latter” and it really opened my eyes. 

The current female-centric reboots are mostly flopping (things like Wonder Woman being exceptions). I found Terminator, Power Rangers, Castle, etc. way cooler when they made them EQUALS with men and not simply trash them. Also, wasn’t it more inspiring when women made it big back then? I remember when the chess player Judith Polgar became famous and was right up there with the men. Now, with a separate Chess league for women, nobody really cares about it. But I’m digressing.

Power Rangers vs the new Ghostbusters is my point. Females were part of the original PR team in almost equal numbers. They usually wore pink and such feminine colour but equally kicked butts in battles. That. Was. Awesome. The new Ghostbusters isn’t. 

Now I’m just not sure that if a woman wins an award that was usually male-dominated, was the reason really merit? Twenty-years ago, it surely would have been.

The article that prompted this post was about Mads Mikkelsen replacing Johnny Depp as Grindelwaldt in Fantastic Beasts 3. He says it's going to be tricky to balance tying the old role into the new while also making the character his own. To stay in the Harry Potter universe, this was exactly the issue with Michael Gambon's version of Dumbledore, he didn't read the books, he didn't base his version off of Richard Harris's performance, he made the character ""his own"" and it kinda ruined it. You're an actor, you're supposed to portray the character as it's meant to be portrayed based off of either an author or script writer's description, stop inflicting your own interpretation or acting style into the character.

[Article I was referring to](https://amp.cinemablend.com/news/2559629/fantastic-beasts-mads-mikkelsen-breaks-silence-on-replacing-johnny-depp-as-grindelwald)


Edit: Ok, let me clarify a little bit. I'm mostly talking about characters that have already been established. Particularly if you're replacing someone in a direct sequel, which is the case here (and with Dumbledore in Harry Potter as well). But also if your character is in a book for instance, most of the time the character's persona and mannerisms are described in detail, to me you should try to get it as close as possible to that description and not freely interpreting the character and put your own flair to it. That's my personal opinion on that. It's also not that serious, I read the article, that statement annoyed me in the context of this movie specifically so I made the post. Also, Richard Harris is the superior Dumbledore, fight me!


Edit 2: My first 1k+ post and it's because people don't agree with me, great, lol. I think the best counter argument I've seen is that we don't want Mads to play Johnny Depp playing Grindelwaldt, which could be a very easy thing to happen if he doesn't make the character his own, and would be quite cringy probably. So I get that for sure.

759,1600267954.0,Gun safety safety training should be a mandatory class in high school,"The justification for Sex Education is that ignorance is more dangerous than knowledge. The same holds true for firearms. Far too many people are shot with ""unloaded"" guns. Ignorance of what guns are and how they work is more dangerous than people knowing what they are, what they can do, and how to safely handle them.

EDIT:

1. Even if you believe that guns should be banned, the legal process for accomplishing this in the US would take decades. It's extremely difficult to alter our constitution, there's considerable opposition to changing it, and the political reality it that it is easier to leave the constitution the way it is than it is to change it. Consequently, even if you want to ban all guns, it still makes sense to teach kids to safely handle them as an interim solution.
2. Teaching kids how to safely handle firearms will not help them shoot up a school. Someone who has never handled one before can figure out how to fire it within a few minutes, especially with movies, computer games, and Google as a guide. Firearms are designed to be as easy to use as possible. Using them destructively is extremely easy. Consequently, handling them safely is harder than using them destructively and requires training.
3. You don't need to bring guns into schools to teach kids how to safely handle them for the same reason you don't need to have sex in the classroom to teach kids how to use a condom.
4. For those who aren't from the US: To understand why the US is ""obsessed"" with guns, you have to understand US history. The US was founded by rebels who were rebelling against a tyrannical  government and they wanted to retain the ability to rebel against their  new government should it also become tyrannical. This is as true today as it was the day it was written. A reasonable argument can be made that  the second amendment protects weapons which are necessary for  overthrowing our own government, should it become tyrannical. It's a  healthy thing for our politicians to be a little afraid of us.
5. Requiring gun safety training, background checks, and licenses at the point of sale simply doesn't work. There are a plethora of ways that your child can encounter a gun without purchasing one. For example, I very vividly remember climbing into my parent's attic  through the ceiling of an unfinished bathroom(which I'm certain they  didn't think I could do) and showing my friends, without the knowledge of their parents, one of my dad's rifles for no other reason than because I thought it was really cool. No one died but someone easily could have. I had no fucking idea what I was doing. There is simply no way that any law or  requirement at the point of sale can prevent scenarios like that from happening.
6. Teaching kids to shoot guns isn't the point. The point is to teach kids how to avoid firing a gun by accident if they encounter one.
7. Not everyone will own a gun and not everyone will encounter a gun during their life. However, the problem is that we don't know which kids will encounter guns and which won't. Therefore, the only way to teach gun safety to the kids who need it is to teach it to all of them.",unpopularopinion

He confessed to recording and distributing a video of a man having sex with a 13-year-old girl and yet... he is literally one of the most prominent artists of 2020 so far?

A lot of the people who like him are millennials and zoomers, who I believed to be progressive enough to shut this type of shit down, yet here we are. This guy is out here topping the charts and everything he says and does is absolutely blown up and near impossible to ignore if you're someone who tries to stay to date with the newest music and media.

I genuinely don't understand it, and I'm disgusted by it. I also just don't get how he has a likeable appearance either if we're going to the more shallow part of my opinion. He's fucking ugly and has purposely destroyed his physical appearance and looks like he hasn't bathed in weeks. He is always getting in trouble and flaming other people and he is just everything a person shouldn't be, and yet he is at the top of the game and unfortunately succeeding.

I personally believe he deserves the opposite of everything he's gained in these past few months. I also no longer like anyone who decides to work with him. It's one thing to separate the art from the artist but to boast the artist by openly & proudly working with the artist (looking at Nicki) makes you seem like you have no problem with working with that sick asshole.

772,1616398670.0,If you are pirating something that isn't available in your country then it is perfectly fine to do it.,"As the title says, I don't see any wrong in pirating content that isn't available to buy in your country. I think you are rather doing the content creator team a favor by doing so as you are in a way increasing the popularity of the show and the people who have access to the content and can afford to buy the dvd might be more inclined to buy something that is more popular. So you are kind of doing them a favor by pirating their content.

Moreover I think people should make it a habit to at least rate the movie or series that they watch. That way you'll be contributing to the popularity of the show.

So yeah that's my two cent. I can't write like most of the other people here as english is my second language. Anyway if it makes sense then that's pretty cool. If it doesn't then please don't downvote as downvoting would cause it to die in new without any interaction and I won't get to hear why my view isn't correct.

Edit:

I very well understand that piracy is not acceptable, but the current model of content delivery is broken. At the moment I have no qualms whatsoever ripping off the odd movie and TV show that isn't available to buy in my country and I see no reason to not experience something for a reason like not being available. There's so much infighting and lack of collaboration from TV and movie studios that no one service is good enough.

I go to the cinema plenty, and I buy movie dvds when I have the chance, so i pay my dues. But this experience is getting less and less pleasurable as it is struggling to compete with my 4k TV connected to my PC at home where I can easily download any movie or series and stream/play it easily. But I always make it an attempt to look for a possibility to watch it in a way that it contributes to the content creator. If it's not available then of course piracy is going to be my choice.

If you look at it then piracy is entirely a distribution problem. There will always be some people who pirate no matter what but majority of people might pirate for only easy access and not only for the sake of pirating. Let's take Netflix(subscribed to it) for example , it allows us to browse large numbers of movies , watching previews of them and then watch it on the spot. Most methods of piracy require you to download the complete movie first and then watch it. This is exactly why streaming platform like Netflix is so popular. Now if only if these studios would realize that the only thing Netflix needs is selection. If pretty much every movie and show go to netflix then piracy would take a huge hit.

Now about buying the DVDs. Here in India we don't have stores where you can just go and buy or rent the dvd. And most of the tv/series and movies are not even available to buy on amazon/prime video , even google play. Anime industry is another entire problem. The ease of access is absolutely non existent.",unpopularopinion

Here's my problems with them

- Hand-brakes : used to be a handle you'd pull, super practical and easy to grab and pull / pump in case of emergency like a brake failure or bad road conditions like black ice. Now it's just a fucking button. No way am I finding it in time in an emergency.

- sliding doors on vans : used to be you could just use the handle and pull the whole door completely open in half a second. Now I use the handle, try to pull the door open but NOOOO it's on its own tiny engine that slowly draws the door in open position over 3 full seconds. Useless.

- windows : used to be a little rolling handle. If it broke you could change the mechanism for like 50$. Now if your tiny electronic window stops rolling down they gotta dismantle the whole door and replace the electronics for 5-6 times the price.

- Trunks with no handles : WHY ? ITS A DOOR. WHY DO I HAVE TO GO TO MY OTHER DOOR TO FIND A BUTTON FOR THE DOOR I'M TRYING TO GET INTO ? FUCK.

- trunks you can't just push down. The SUVs are really bad for that one, you try to close the damn trunk and you're forcing against whatever piece of shit motor they have in there to close it for you with a button. And no it's not about customer's height because most often the damn button is exactly where you'd grab the trunk door to close it. Just another useless feature.

-  The seats : Pull the side handle to adjust seatback, pull underside handle to adjust seat distance. Moves almost instantly and follows your own movements. Instinctive and easy. Now it's again, 3-4 piece of shit plastic button that I have to wait for to do their job at a snail's pace and, just like windows, they will eventually  break (which I've never seen on the seat adjustments on older cars that weren't in accidents) and cost you 5-6 times the price to fix.

- Cameras on 37 angles :  USE YOUR FUCKING EYES. 5000$ price hike *at least* to stick cameras everywhere just because people can't be bothered to take a 2 second look around before backing up into their own kid. And those cameras will never last as long as the car anyway. I legit saw cameras turn on when you put your blinkers and it showed *exactly* what the side mirror was showing. 

- self adjusting seat : the goddamn thing moves back when you turn off the engine, (I imagine to let fat Americans out of the car,) moves back to position when you turn it on. Why? WHYYYYYY ? If your seat is properly adjusted once, you should be able to get in and out of it and never touch the fucking thing again.

774,1569195972.0,American Colleges shouldn't force you to take classes irrelevant to your career path.,"According to my understanding, most of the world doesnt require you to have an undergraduate degree to go into medical school, with their medical school just being 6 years long. In america, to become be in a medical career, you need 8 years of school vs the 6 years at other countries. 


In those 8 years of school, I must take philosophy, sociology, and speech to get an undergraduate in biology. There are *some* classes you can wriggle an argument for, like physics 1 or writing, but probably not physics 2 or speech.



Saying ""colleges just want to make you well rounded"" makes you sound like (and I hate using this term) a sheep. To my understanding, American colleges were more identical to the rest of the world's some time ago. (Not 100% sure on that) So, by saying that colleges want to make you more well-rounded is like saying previous generations of STEM field grads weren't (*or even grads from other countries that is*).  Taking philosophy for 1 semester isn't going to turn my life upside down, not 90°, not 45°, not even 1°.


Edit: ok, I understand and agree that philosophy is important. However, learning that other countries do not require 8 years of education to be in a medical field, makes me irritated at my beloved country. I just used philosophy as pet peeve to get a point across. 1 semester of a particular liberal art feels more like an excuse to siphon money, especially if it is considered vital for an undergraduate that is completely irrelevant. Hell, my school has bio ethics, I haven't taken it yet but that seems like a lovely way to possibly blend philosophy and biology, keeping it relevant.

The argument quickly becomes less about the topic and more about you as an opponent.

Masking disingenuous motives under the guise of righteousness is what makes this behaviour particularly reprehensible. Two human beings should be able to have a civil disagreement on anything - even if one the persons views are seemingly ridiculous, (Earth being flat, etc). To be open minded you must try to understand _why_ they believe what they believe and maybe stand a chance of educating them, or at least coming out of the conversation better understanding the root cause of their misguided beliefs. Maybe I’m too much of an optimist.

EDIT: To clarify, this is obviously a generalisation and doesn’t apply to all cases. It also does not appeal to the idea that someone who is outraged is wrong and someone who isn’t is right. I could have the patience of a saint and still be wrong (and I often am). The key is that ones emotional state does not provide moral status, and should not be the _habitual_ basis through which you win arguments.

I’m under the impression that people don’t even know what genetically modified even means and everyone is falling for propaganda that companies are using to mark up their products. 

Genetically modified crops, most of the time, are crops that have been through artificial selection. That means we noticed a couple of plants that we were growing produced bigger fruit with less seeds or they are less likely to die from weather or from pests or etc, so bred them with each other to create the plant that we enjoy today. This is something that happens naturally through evolution and natural selection as well. There’s nothing crazy or unhealthy about it. It doesn’t change the fruit or vegetables nutrition very much and it certainly doesn’t make it less healthy. 

Another way we genetically modify, which is less likely, is that we give the plant DNA that does all the things artificial selection does like pest resistance, longer growing season, bigger fruit, etc. except it takes a way shorter time. it is actually very helpful environmentally because it reduces the use pesticides. There arent any adverse health effects- it’s still just a fruit or vegetable. There are positive environmental effects. 

Another big point is that there are only something like 10 crops that are genetically modified and sold in America. So when something says “non GMO” it never would’ve had GMOs anyway. It doesn’t make it healthier. I got a chocolate bar that said “non GMO” and I was like ???? This is totally just a marketing scheme.

They offer hundreds of hours of playability only from the single player modes thanks to rich open world's, rich narrative and great replay value. I have had Red Dead Redemption since launch day and still play it frequently to this day.

Now in some cases online multiplayer is fine but not in recent times. Take GTA online for example. In 2013 it was good but with the new updates and expansions it's not short of being unplayable with players flying across the maps and shooting you every time you spawn. Another issue is modders and tryhards who do their UTMOST best to ruin your and your friends game. I cannot walk in warzone without being sniped from the other side of the map or encountering campers.

808,1556098997.0,Instagram is ruining everything (a rant),"I think that Instagram is one of the worst developments in modern culture. Let me explain:

1. **IG is the most shallow of all social media platforms**. While social media platforms like twitter and sometimes even Facebook politically engage people, allow them to connect and organise Instagram is solely based on one person and their looks/life/vacation. No political or important dialogue is happening. I would argue that even Pinterest is more worthwile since at least DIYs teach you something.
2. **IG is all fake but everyone pretends that it's real.** Why we are all pretty much aware from our own Instagram use that these images are usually not what our lives look like all instagram users apparently have this pact that they are just all going to believe each other's bullshit.
3. **IG is bad for your mental health.** Because unrealistic standards are set on Instagram but everyone just pretends like they're real people doing real things it feels like everybody's life is the way it looks in IG. This also creates feelings of inadequacy and is therefore detrimental to especially young people's mental health. (See also this article: [http://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/](http://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/)). I also think this applies equally to women and men since the unrealistic standards concerning looks and lifestyle are more than ever directed towards both genders while they previously were more directed towards women as in e.g. advertising.  Additionally, the dopamine rush people get from likes creates an almost addiction-like potential that makes them use the app more and more and making the mental health issues even more pronounced.
4. **IG makes people vain.** Taking pictures of yourself all day makes you the center of your own attention and that leads to ignoring other people and the actual experience you're documenting. It's not about where you went what you ate or what incredible experience you had but only what it looked like and what you looked like doing it. This makes everybody focus more and more on their own appearance and less about things that actually make you a successful human being.
5. **IG gives the worst incentives to people.** The reason I am ranting right now is that I saw a Vice video about a poppy field in California that is killed by people sitting and stepping on it to take pictures predominantly for Instagram (Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxUrr-CIgkA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxUrr-CIgkA)). They then talked to the people taking the pictures asking them why they're doing it and their answers made me incredibly angry. Some people were open about just wanting likes but some others pretended like they were really concerned about the flowers talking about ""the feeling of being one with nature"". So these people want to signal to others that they love nature and the beauty of it while literally destroying the natural habitat and the flowers. This shows that they really don't care about anything at all except their likes on a goddamn picture. Now I don't think that they are inherently bad people but I think that Instagram actively gives them an incentive to be this way fuelled by the addictive potential of the platform and the likes you get from it.

I would encourage anyone reading this to please examine how much time you spend on Instagram and if you get anything from it than a simple dopamine rush and feelings of inadequacy and think of what you could do that's more meaningful and actually makes you happy.

EDIT: A lot of people are posting that they follow artists, architects, blacksmiths etc. and use Instagram predominantly in a small community or niche.

And while some of you are so blessed as to not experience this culture in your everyday lives I feel like for others the posting ""cute"" pictures of oneself is a crucial part of social life e.g. kids in middle/high school. I do think that every social media platform can be great since it really depends on the users and what they post.

A child, especially one too young to really understand what's going on shouldn't be exposed to this stuff, and when there's glass and bricks flying, fires being lit, etc it's way too dangerous for them anyways.

When someone near you and your kid start acting up and the police start throwing teargas or pepper spraying people and your kid gets caught in the middle of it or your kid gets kit or hurt by some demonstrator throwing something or lighting off fireworks, it's not the cops fault and it's not the protesters fault.

The other half is vehemently against me. 

I want to point some things out: 
1. If you read through the comments you’ll learn that I’ve seen all the movies, but I’ve only read books one and two. This is what my entire opinion was based on. As a preteen I read all the time. I grew up in a tiny town where in the summer all I could do was read or play outside. I got so bored that I would read the farmer’s almanac... I went into Harry Potter thinking I would love it because, well, everyone does. I read the first two and was kinda disappointed. It WAS good, it just wasn’t get-a-lighting-bolt-tattoo kinda good. That’s my whole opinion. Harry Potter is a good series. In my opinion, it’s just not good enough to have lasted so long in popular media. To me it’s not good enough to want to talk about it all the time, make an Instagram account about it, get a bumper sticker about it, stuff like that. I respect people who do, I just don’t get it at all because to me they were fine, but not exceptional. I think they’re overrated, not bad, that’s the whole post.

Also you are basically lying to them for some consumerism and you basically create brats that are only motivated to do good for a present.

We know TWO things about teenagers: (1) they need between 8-10 hours of sleep per night and (2) that their circadian rhythms, or the biological mechanism that regulates human sleep and wakeness patterns, operate in a way that, on average, they don't start producing melatonin until after 11 PM. 

Taking those two facts into consideration, the typical high class has class at around 7 am and most students have to wake up between an hour or two hours before their first class if they don't want to be late. So like at 5 or 6 am. Let's assume that teens fall asleep right on the dot at 11 pm (even though in reality they actually fall asleep much later since melatonin takes time to induce sleep), and have to wake up at 6 am. That's only 7 hours of sleep, which is already under the 8-10 hour requirement.

And in reality since most teens fall asleep at least 15 or so minutes after 11 PM, as well as how some students wake up for school even earlier than 6, you have students getting between 4 and 6 hours of sleep, and this situation gets worse for students with jobs, lots of family obligations, extracurriculars, or lots of homework. 

These earlier start times just DON'T work. We already have the data for why they're a terrible idea and even the CDC recommends that all high schools start no earlier than 8:30 am.

The reason I say 10 instead of 8:30 is because those same students who fall asleep at midnight and have to wake up two or so hours before school starts to make it on time would get 8 or 9 hours of sleep. You would have to fall asleep at 1 or 2 am to fall below the 8-10 number. That's way better than if you had school at 8:30 or even nine.

And I know what people are gonna say. But what about students with jobs? What about athletics or clubs? What if the school day is longer?

Well, for athletics or clubs you can either have them at 9 am or have them as part of the regular school day if we reduce instruction time (which we should do anyway), so that way people don't have to stay after school. You can also have tutorials and additional help during these times. 

And about students with jobs, well I'm sorry but the rest of the school body shouldn't have to suffer because a minority of students have jobs. What's more, with a later start time, people have more time to spend doing things in the evening so maybe try to adjust your hours with your boss? 

(I also think we shouldn't assign homework but that's a popular opinion lol) 


*TL; DR*, a 10 AM start time would allow students to get the recommended sleep more easily and more often, improve grades, attendence, and classroom participation, and also greatly benefit student health, both physically and mentally. Let's do it!

Edit:

I forgot to put this in the original:

Also we can shorten the school day so we get out at like 3:45 pm or something. Research shows that classes really shouldn't be longer than an hour anyway. Some of y'all literally have no imagination or problem solving skills lol.

Almost every subreddit seems to have some form of masturbation or porn joke. And if you can’t understand or relate to it, youre going to be downvoted to hell and given comments like “We all know you secretly masturbate at home. Stop trying to pretend to not understand it”. Same with Instagram and Twitter. Like alright, cool, guys like to wank one out and stuff, but people should realize that maybe watching stuff like that isn’t enjoyable for all. Im just saying, theres a good number of guys out there who don’t find interest in any of those (including me, but I have a different reason). Not saying that doing the aforementioned actions are bad, but like, it shouldnt be seen as part of the definition of a guy on the internet

EDIT: should say that I do not think that masturbation or watching porn is inherently bad. I know the former is actually healthy (idk about the latter), just that those who don’t do the two things I mentioned shouldnt feel bad for not doing them

846,1604443023.0,Stoners are unattractive,"I once tried dating a girl who smoked weed everyday all day, and quite frankly, it was a mess. She would always forget about hanging out, she was lazy, and she rarely if ever left her house (which was filled with junk).

Don't get me wrong, she seemed like an incredible person and probably was, but she was a shell of what she could've been because weed was basically her entire personality and way of life and she was completely fine with it. I do smoke occasionally at parties and whatever, but I think people who blaze all day are just super unattractive. It's as if they do not have any other serious hobbies or passions, and they rarely make time for anything else unless smoking is involved. It is super hard to be in a serious relationship with a stoner because they are just couch potatoes from what I've seen, and that is super unattractive.

I've tried to casually bring this up in a conversation with my friends before, and they think edgy stoner girls are hot and don't see a problem with dating them. I brought up these points in conversation and they just go with the classic, ""nahhh I want a thicc stoner goth babe"". I'm pretty sure quite a decent majority of people don't see a problem with this.

While looking at this, it may sound like the best thing ever, to be able to evaluate any argument based on its merit, and it is, but it also is sometimes the worst. Worst as in, there will be people who are so fanatically invested in their side's argument that anyone pointing out any flaw in that argument is abused, and criticized relentlessly, and I cannot push back in the same way with the arguments that their opposing group provides because I know that the opposing group's argument isn't also good enough, then lo and behold, I'm criticised by both the parties, without almost anyone understanding what I meant to say.

Doesn't this clearly constitute a cruel and unusual punishment? Why do we normalize this as an expectation of being incarcerated?

We all know there’s two sides to every story. We also all know that retail jobs suck, pay crap, and the majority of retail managers may not always be the best, some can be the absolute worst. But if you think it’s cool to quit on a live stream or tik-tok to call out some bad manager who nobody else knows, and show to your fans how cool and edgy you think you are, you’re an idiot. No different than the clowns who film an argument to show the world ….thinking they’re right…… only to get shamed for their sheer stupidity and lack of self-awareness later. 

Sure your feelings may be real and reasons for quitting are legit, but it’s obvious as you read your prepared notes, your voice trembles and your hands shake, that you’re just showing off and doing this performance for tik tok and so your friends can high five you for sticking it to the “man-anger” later, and it’s painfully obvious they wouldn’t be putting on the same shit show while quitting if it weren’t for the camera.

What this narcissistic display shows the world is that from a professional employment standpoint, you aren’t able to process or handle your emotions very well under pressure, and that these folks have issues taking responsibility, and handling themselves in a mature way. 

That said most of these videos so far seem to be teens, or not always fully matured emotionally, while adults are usually the evil managers, which makes sense. So I give them some leeway for being teens, but if adults start doing this  petty crap God help us. 

All this is simply indulging in one's anger to make the person feel better about quitting. Trust, managers ain’t going home feeling bad or questioning themselves over losing you as an employee because you quit while making an ass out of yourself. You made this easy for them they didn’t need to fire you. 

It really just ends up looking like nothing more than a cheap shot. A punch to the back of the head as you walk away. The person doing it looks very weak. 

Be strong. Be mature and quit like an adult, and move on if you can’t take your job or manager. Everything in life doesn’t need to be a tik tok show for your friends.

This is by no means a defense for bad managers, bad employers, corporate America or horrible human beings in general.

Yes, adults are always expected to be right but that doesn't make their mistakes invisible to children.

881,1619358442.0,Watching a small Twitch streamer who is bad at video games is more entertaining than watching a big shot Twitch streamer who is great at video games.,"So for this I have various points and don’t feel like writing an essay so going to just make a list. Know going into this that the appeal of Twitch for me is the sense of community.
1) The occasional failure of someone who isn’t great at video games humanizes them in a way. Seeing the failure that they sometimes have makes them seem real. Streamers who can destroy a game lobby seem like gods. An entity separate from humanity. Their caliber and constant success undermines the most interesting part of humanity. Failure. That’s why I don’t find them entertaining when they play video games. 
2) There are too many people watching those huge streamers and too many people in the chat. I know that this is kinda in the job description of being a huge streamer, but Twitch is supposed to be a platform to interact with the streamer. Instead, it feels like a constant gamble wether or not the streamer will even acknowledge your existence. There is constant spam which makes the chat even more overwhelming. You don’t get that with small streamers. Having ten people at any given time watching the stream makes you feel special. Nine out of ten times, the streamer will read your chat message. Sometimes it might turn into a full conversation. Hell, if you’re lucky, you might even get bumped up to VIP status. You feel significant. Appreciated. 
3) Kind of going off of the previous point, everything nice that you do matters to a small streamer. Wether it’s donating bits or subscribing or gifting a subscription, the small streamer will actually appreciate that. Not to say that all huge streamers are scumbags because a good amount aren’t, but there are a lot of big streamers where any monetary donation doesn’t really matter to them. I used to watch a streamer who had 65,000 subscribers. I’m sure they have more now, but in order to not call them out, I’m just going to to use 65,000 while doing math. A tier-1 subscription costs 5 dollars. Twitch partners get about half of the money from a subscription, the other half goes to Twitch itself. 65,000x2.5=162,500. That’s how much they earn in a month from tier-1 subscriptions alone. That doesn’t even take tier 2 or 3 subscriptions or bits into account. Now, to find how much they earn in a year let’s do 162,500x12=1,950,000. Do you really think ten bits matters to them? What about a small streamer with only 5 subscribers? 5x2.5x12=150. Ten bits matters a lot more to them.

This went on a lot longer than it thought it would.

If you agree with me, might I recommend a streamer named Smutav. Before you ask, it’s not me. Smutav is an art and video game streamer. https://m.twitch.tv/smutav.

The sandwich is delicious without that.


Maybe I'm missing something. But I truly don't believe that I am. Tomatoes can go away and the food world would be better for it. I only recently started to accept ketchup for just burgers, but honestly that can go too if it means no more tomatoes involved ever again.

The idea of fun like holidays or vacation or parties or birthdays is usually tied to drinking and alcohol dependency is crippling families across the world on a scale that no other drug competes with. Puking, drunk driving, loud obnoxious behavior, sexual harassment and down right embarrassing behavior is a normality that couples drinking.

Edit: People saying “Heroin is worse/coke is worse” I’ve seen addiction in all shapes and sizes between first hand witnessing heroin overdoses to living with a cocaine/crack addict to having a best friend addicted to meth, not a single one of those drugs is as widespread, popular and accessible as alcohol is nor are they socially acceptable. As a society as a whole no other drugs come close to the damage alcohol has caused. That’s a fact. Though I guess it wouldn’t be an unpopular opinion if people weren’t disagreeing with me.

I keep seeing posts from people complaining that homeless people aren't properly thankful when given a banana or a loaf of bread when they are panhandling.

If they are in need and are homeless then cash is the way to help. Nobody knows their needs better than the person with needs. Maybe they need money for a prescription or a hotel room or a new tent or any number of things.

It people don't want to give money, then it makes sense to ask ""can I give you food instead?"" 

If the answer is ""no thanks,"" then give nothing or give money.

The concern is always that the money will be used for drugs or alcohol, but why? If you want to give, then who are you to judge how it's used?

Also, if drugs or alcohol can provide a suffering human with a small amount of temporary respite in this world, what is wrong with that?

On my post about being a recovering porn addict. What is wrong with people? 

I'll start off by saying that I'm a recovering porn addict, so maybe I'm a little more sensitive to this than most guys. 

And I'll say now that AFAIK I have never visited a sub on this account that is for porn or posting nudes or even lewds. I have never commented or so much as left an up or downvote on any of those subs. 

But I still end up with (so far only) female nsfw content creators following me on here for no other reason than to get me to look at their profile. 

When I click the notification I am immediately taken to their page with a feed full of their porn, I did not consent to see their porn and it's incredibly triggering for me. 

It hasn't caused a relapse so far, I'm 149 days clean today and I'm not about to throw it away. But it just gives me urges that are really fucking fatiguing to deal with and that I didn't need. 

I fully support sex work as real work, and have nothing against creators that don't send unsolicited links to their porn. 

This feels like another example of ""men always want it"", and it's really harmful.

Edit: all I am doing in order to have this material appear on my screen is to thing ""oh cool I wonder who's followed me"" and click on the notification, and it's right there. The nsfw filter does not work on brand new accounts who have only posted to their page. 

It's not OK to do this to anyone, but it's very clear with a glance at my post history than I'm a recovering addict and you probably shouldn't be linking me to their porn.

910,1617871441.0,Teen relationships CAN last and you are an asshole if you tell teens it won’t work out,"While often high-school relationships don’t last long, it is not an unbreakable rule. Some relationships which start between two teenagers last longer than anyone would expect. Those relationships can also be more mature than relationships of people in their 30s. Not one relationship is the same as the other. Everyone is different and each relationship is unique. No one can know how it will work out or what goes on in the relationship. You can be 60 year old with 300 past relationships and tons of experience, but you are still in no place to judge whether the relationship is going to last or not.

There is a certain pattern and yes, teen relationships don’t on average last long. However, I am sick people telling teens that their relationship is not going to last. It’s simply something you don’t tell. It is rude. But older people usually think they have a right to comment on teen relationships and tell them about the outcome or assume they know anything about what’s going on between two people.

Men who don’t want women to use dildos or vibrators; women who don’t want men to watch porn (or some specific kind of porn); people of all genders who feel somehow rejected or even cheated on when their partner masturbates.

When someone wants to control what their SO wears or their hobbies or social life, everyone is quick to proclaim how controlling, boundary-trampling, and potentially abusive this behavior is. But when it comes to people laying out rules for how/if their SO can masturbate, somehow this is treated as a normal and okay thing for a partner to have control over.

This is NOT normal or okay. 

Your insecurities about your SO masturbating are not your SO’s problem. 

Being in a monogamous sexual relationship doesn’t grant you dominion over the other person’s body and mind. 

People get to think and fantasize about whatever tf they want, watch whatever tf kind of porn they want, and masturbate however and with whatever tf kind of toys they want. Trying to police that because you are insecure is totally inappropriate and controlling behavior. You should neither do this to a partner nor tolerate a partner doing it to you. 

Exceptions where it’s okay for a partner to make requests / impose their opinions:
- Excessive masturbation/porn addiction negatively impacts the couple’s sex life
- Matters of basic courtesy (e.g., don’t leave porn out on the computer; don’t do it in the bed next to me, etc.)
- When it involves interactions with real people (e.g., virtual sex workers or sexting with internet strangers)

It's mentally and emotionally harmful. It encourages you to use it habitually. It might not be physically addicting but it's certainly highly psychologically addicting. How many people do you know who use marijuana casually? The problem is that people abuse it frequently, and it causes them to suffer or atrophy in other areas of their lives, or they use it to cope with something else they're not willing to confront.

For me, I used weed as an excuse to not participate in society. Rather than see my friends I would just get stoned and turn off my phone. I wouldn't talk to anyone or go out. I was afraid to go out so I used weed as an excuse not to.

This caused me to have low self esteem. I thought of myself as a loser pothead - because I was. I think many potheads feel this way, but they would never admit it to anyone else.

But once I finally decided to drop it once and for all, my life has improved so drastically. I felt like a human again, like a member of society. And I realized that it hardly even did anything for me anyway. It turned me into a stupid person. I'm not stupid.

I think the damage that marijuana does is complex, but significant. I think the culture surrounding it and its reputation as a ""safe"" drug is extremely dangerous.

To quote the great and wise Randy Marsh:

>Well, Stan, the truth is marijuana probably isn't gonna make you kill people, and it most likely isn't gonna fund terrorism, but… well, son, pot makes you feel fine with being bored. And it's when you're bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or being creative. If you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you aren't good at *anything*.

edit: This thread really blew up so I would add on: if you feel you're in a similar situation to mine, my best advice is to reconnect with friends and focus on your abilities, skills, and talents. When I quit I focused more on my creative writing and that built my self esteem like crazy. I realized that the feeling of fulfillment and happiness I got from doing this every day was far greater than the meager feeling of being high that I got from marijuana. I'm now on track to finish my first novel by the end of the year.

A lot of comments are talking about how moderation is key and not everyone uses it the same. My question is: why use this drug at all? What does it help you with? And for whatever problem it is, is there another, more organic way you could solve this problem? For example if you have anxiety, maybe you can work on therapy or confronting this issue and trying to get some closure.

If you feel the need to get high every day, ask yourself: Do I enjoy life without this drug? And if not, try to figure out why that is and what could help to change it.",unpopularopinion

927,1580315694.0,Encouraging children in school to have perfect attendance is detrimental to their health now and it forms unhealthy work habits that will follow them for the rest of their lives.,"Schools, in my area at least, have been allowing fewer days for leave for sickness and becoming more strict on how and when those days are used. This is to encourage ""perfect attendance"" and it is harmful to the child in more than one way. 

1. The child is pressured into attending school even when sick, further suppressing an immune system that is already stressed by environmental factors. This can lead to a number of complications for the child, both short and long term, from leaving them susceptible to secondary infection, to the development of autoimmune disorders. If the child is taught to take proper care of their health and to heal when they are ill, then they will be better off in both regards.
2. The child is being conditioned to work ill. The future can never change to allow for better work conditions if the next generation does not progress beyond what the previous has. From a young age, American children are taught they must suck it up and work through it. Studies have shown that if a worker is given a generous sick leave, not only does the productivity go up but the medical cost goes down because the chances of serious illnesses are reduced. Workers can afford to stay home when they are sick. Our students are taught that working ill is what is expected of them and not only is it expected but most schools are tightening the noose and making it harder for the children to take leave when necessary. By the time an adult emerges from the school, they are used to ""shaking it off.""
3. The financial burden that is placed on a family because of policy change requiring doctors notes when insurance is not widely affordable, nor is a visit to a local doctor exactly cheap. A same-day visit to a local urgent care can easily run two hundred to three hundred dollars. This is also coupled with the hit already being taken by a parent that is missing work and may or may not have paid leave to do so. If a note is not returned to the school from a local doctor, at the very least the absence is unexcused and counts against the child, affecting everything from grades to driver licenses. In more strict counties and municipalities, a child can be counted truant without the doctor's note. Policies like these are ill-guided and do not produce the results desired. They impact grades and performance in a negative manner and hurt the morale of both parent and student.

930,1647043172.0,Taco Bell doesn't give you the shits. You just never eat fiber.,"Final edit: god damn. This has got to be the dumbest thing to blow up. I'm actually pretty disappointed in you guys

I said what I said. Anyone who says taco bell is awful because of this, just doesn't eat foods high in fiber.

They've been proven to be one of the healthiest fast food chains, and all of their ingredients are simple straight forward ingredients. No BS sci-fi concoctions.

Edit: ok. After listening and giving it some more thought, it's probably a combination of a few things. Fiber, spice, and maybe fat?

I also had this other thought. If all fast food chains let their foods sit out, the ""faker"" ones with more preservatives probably don't affect you as much as other basic ingredients do.

Edit 2: just for some clarification because I think some people are misinterpreting. I am holding taco bell to the same standard as other fast food chains. When talking about fast food, people are often on board for McDonald's, but scared taco bell will kill them.",unpopularopinion

But, the amount of Marvel fans that I see, both on Reddit and elsewhere, who circlejerk about the amazing 'cinematography' of Marvel films, and then proceed to show the same 4 colourful stills from Guardians or Endgame, is ***exhausting***, especially as a Marvel fan myself. 
 
Listen, pretty sparkly rainbow pictures don't automatically make a film artful, or cinematically significant. This is *especially* true when your entire business model is about mass producing the same superhero movie 20 times.
 
The reality of the matter is that the overwhelming majority of all Marvel films are shot in the same cookie-cutter manner. The framing is acceptable, the symbolism of shots is very, **VERY** heavy-handed at *BEST* - oh my god guyz, look, the 3 good guyz are in the light bit of the sky and the evil baddies are down in the dark bit wif the clouds behind them!!!! woaah!!!! good symbolism guyz!!!! - and a good 99% of the soundtracks are forgettable as all hell. Marvel's movies are fun action flicks, and that's totally fine, but I see so many people trying to peg each new MCU film as a visionary piece of cinematic art, and they really just aren't.

 
It's annoying, because it's not even like the superhero format invalidates a film as a medium for art. Like, look at Into the Spiderverse. That movie is absolutely pornographic. So is The Dark Knight. So is Man of Steel, arguably. So is Joker. But Marvel movies? Sure, they're good films, **but people need to stop pretending like the MCU is artistically significant or visually exceptional, because none of it is.** In my opinion, anyways.
 
This is coming from someone who *likes* Marvel films and grew up with/watched the *entire* MCU. It's the grilled cheese of cinema - it's cheap, it's fun, it's easy, it's simple. But don't try to pretend that it's caviar, because it just isn't.",unpopularopinion

They want to assure me that I’m pretty, but all I’m trying to say is that not being beautiful isn’t a problem to begin with. 

Let’s focus on who we are as a whole. I get that “beautiful” can mean more than just how you look and there’s a huge difference between saying “everybody is beautiful” and “every body is beautiful.” Nevertheless, beauty typically takes the context of looks more than soul and I think the message ends up becoming about liking how you look vice liking who you are.",unpopularopinion

946,1615184964.0,Screaming the way people do in metal and some rock music is impressive as fuck and I’m tired of people saying it’s not,"Before I begin I want to explain why I believe this is unpopular: pop and rap music are so much more popular than metal just by looking at monthly listeners on Spotify. Pop artists and rappers can have up to 50 million monthly listeners meanwhile the biggest metal band in history has 16 million (which is still a lot obviously but in defense of my point, they hardly ever feature screaming in their music)

Ok with that out of the way, every time I see people hating on rock and metal, about 99% of people’s complaints are “they’re just screaming, it takes no talent, anyone can do it” which is just plain false. People who can do that shit with their voice are extremely talented, and the people who can do that at a live concert for up to like 2 hours straight are even more talented. It takes talent, skill, practice, and technique to do it properly and many vocalists have to work their asses off for YEARS to learn to do it well enough to be in a band. 

I dare you right now to try to scream like they do in metal. Do either a really high deathcore scream or a really low death metal growl. Yeah sure you can try but I’d be willing to be all my money if you just tried for the first time, it sounds nothing like it does in the music. 

There’s a video on YouTube where a guy goes in public and asks a bunch of random people to “give him their best metal scream”. About 95% of people can’t do it. But when someone CAN do it, he then asks them how long they’ve been doing vocals, and the answer is always the same. Years. Many years.

967,1694791220.0,Men who leave after finding out a child is not theirs are unfairly vilified,"There is a kind of post I see occasionally on subreddits like AITA, AITAH, relationshipadvice, etc. that fits this basic structure:Man finds out the mother of his child/children cheated on him around the time their child was conceived, gets or wants a DNA test to find out if child is biologically his, finds out they are not, and leaves that family. There are variations of this but that's the basic premise.Every. Single. Time. that man is torn apart in the comments, saying that blood does not matter, the child is not at fault, how on earth could he leave them etc.Frankly, I think this is nonsense, through and through. The narrative of these comments always focuses on the man being horrible for leaving and that the child is his because of the time they spent together and not that he was a victim of a lying spouse that deceived him for years.  And for a relevant bit of background, I was adopted as a child and I absolutely believe blood/genetics do not matter in making a family at all. But the big thing there is that for my parents, there was a choice. They made the informed decision that they would accept my as their child, it was not forced on them.Now don't get me wrong, I don't think the men in these examples are saints at all, but so often they are accused of never even caring for the kid(s) and that they must be terrible for being so ruthless. What never gets mentioned, or is at least glossed over, is that the man in question just had his whole life upended by finding out that his partner in life cheated and deceived him for possibly years on end and his life is going to be turmoil. And if this occurs in the US at least, the man is still going to be on the hook for child support even with the proof the kid is not his, meaning he doesn't even get to go restart his life if he wants to, but instead is tied to the situation where he was the victim.You can hope that the man's love for the child might break through that, but it's unfair to attack him because he isn't strong enough to overcome what was done to him. To him, that child will be the living embodiment of the mother's deception and cruelty and to ridicule someone for not wanting that to be part of their life is absurd.Lastly, for the people who say something like ""I could never leave my child/I wouldn't do that!""... well good for you, but it's easy to say that sort of thing, and even if its true, that doesn't mean someone who can't handle that sort of thing is a monster.

EDIT:
Hi guys, thank you all for joining in the discussion, i would like to comment on and apologize for some things:
   I was a bit short-spoken on the whole thing. To clarify my thoughts: being *habitually* (big thanks to the +200 comments pointing that out, as well as the ""you're"" mistake) late means over 30-n/a minutes on most occasions, of course I do not expect everyone being punctual constantly, nobody is.
   I am sorry for not including any mental/physical difficulties as an ""adequate excuse"" (ADHD/IBS/EFD/OCD etc.) and did not mean to sound ableist, hope i did not ruin many of your days with this and i have nothing against neurodivergent people (Still, big shout-out to the few ADHD/other comments striving to be punctual even though it's difficult, i have nothing but respect for you).
  Secondary: Having kids/Overworking/Traffic/Weather/other miscalculations are also, of course, a proper excuse. Culture (as a lot of you pointed out) is also very common and i have an opposite personal example: I studied Cooking and got sucked in the whole Kitchen Culture in which being late/calling out is considered unprofessional and immature. And uncounsciously i became punctual with my everyday life (and thus manage it better).Culture is a double-edged sword, it gives and takes.


   Bearing all of this in mind i still hold my initial stance: If you have no diagnosis on a mental/physical issue or some of the secondary problems mentioned above that we all experience in day-to-day life, if you're constantly late because you genuinely don't care about other people's time or just do it for the sake of being late? Then you a mental midget.

You don't even have to dress up nicely, sweatpants are perfectly fine, but you mean to tell me you rolled out of bed and came straight to the store? No preparation? You walk around the store and then go straight in to bed wearing those same clothes? Nasty.

Edit: to those saying ""why should I care"", because we live in a collective society. We have socially acceptable levels of formality depending on the situation. Funerals, Galas, Weddings, first dates, work conferences, nightclubs, dinner with extended family, hanging out casually with friends at a bar, all have an expected level of formality, to different degrees. At the very bottom is the baseline of being in public. It's not that much to say you should at least dress like an adult to go to target. 

When I see somebody wearing PJ'S in public, I think about it for a brief second when I see them, pass a modicum of judgement, and then move on with my day. In the same way if I see someone with a hentai sweater. Like damn this person has 0 respect for themselves but aight live your life.

975,1692644094.0,"Letting cats sleep in your bed is disgusting, letting them walk on counters, and tables you eat at, is even worse.","Cats walk around in boxes they shit and piss in several times a day. Letting them walk around where you sleep is disgusting, no matter how often you clean the sheets, and letting them walk on counters and tables is extremely unsanitary at best. 

I've had cats my whole life, still do, and they have never been allowed in my bed, and I close the door to the room when I sleep. They never jump on tables and counters because I've trained them not to, and I've never had a problem doing so.

Since people keep acting like it's absolutely impossible to train or condition cats, despite the fact that it very much is possible and you look silly, here's how to do it:

Starting young is best, obviously. Start by putting tin foil, and if that doesn't work use sticky tape, on your counters. They'll hate being up there. This way you're training them to not like the action of jumping up there, instead of the fact that they get disciplined. If you're only conditioning them with discipline they'll only learn that it upsets you, not that they shouldn't do it. A lot of people have said some variation of ""they just don't get up there while you're looking"" because they don't understand WHY my cats don't go up on my counters. They don't go up there because THEY don't want to, not because it makes me mad. Also, if you ever do have to scold or discipline your cats, make sure you do it right after the action, and please don't apologize to them afterwards. When I do have to scold my one cat for something he then tries to rub up against my leg, and I avoid letting him do so by moving my legs out of the way when he tries. He's not trying to apologize when he does this, he's trying to smooth things over, you need to show your cat it's not ok by not letting them do that. 

Edit: It's always hilarious to me that this opinion upsets people to such a degree that they post angry comments. Do whatever you want with your cats as long as you're not harming them. That's your business.

Edit 2: People calling me cruel for not letting my cats sleep in my bed look, and are, ridiculous.

Edit 3: People train tigers to jump through flaming hoops but seemingly 99% of you think it's inconceivable that you would be able to keep your 9 pound housecat off the countertops? Guys, you're just lazy and haven't even tried to train them, and that's ok, but get a grip.",unpopularopinion
976,1690904976.0,Phones are not why kids aren't going outside.,"I see a lot of people talkong about how kids don't play outside like they used to, or how they're spoiled on their phones, making posts like ""What did people do all day without the internet?"" People treat that as if outside is somehow now a foreign concept to younger generations, and often the blame is put on phones phones phones, the big evil cellphone. 

Now for context, I'm 21, and I grew up in the midwest, so I didn't have a smartphome until like 14 years old, and it was barely even a smartphone. Now, I personally think that blaming phones for the issue of less kids outside is just plain ignorant. I have two completely separate reasons for believing this.

The first being, the way I grew up. I grew up throughout the 2000s amd 2010s, the era most point to as ""the last time kids went outside and weren't distracted by those dang phones"". Now, I didn't have a phone for a very long time. But I did have movies, a PS2, and the internet. I have very fond memories of all these things, but I also know that among these things, I constantly went outside with friends. These were good distractions too, YouTube, and Newgrounds content. Still, we went outside a lot, and had to knock on eachother's doors to see who was available. 

The second reason is that people assume kids don't want to go outside. Personally, I see kids playing outside in my neighborhood all the time.. well, when it's not 105°F outside. Not even just in my neighborhood, I see kids and teenagers walking, biking, or skating all around here when I'm driving. People assume phones are some evil thing that's killing outside, but kids are drawn to the outside still. Outside has just become infinitely more uncomfortable, mean, and dangerous since I was a kid. So I don't blame them for staying inside a little, especially when they have the convenience to just text their friends to see who's available right off the bat, saving them a trip. 

Side note: I'm not trying to gloss over the addictive nature of apps like TikTok. I just know YouTube held a similar status in my childhood, and similarly, Vine did too. So I figured that's still kind of comparing apples to apples.

I suppose overall, the point I'm trying to make is, I don't think it's phones making kids not go outside. Technological distraction is not a new thing by any means, and kids still always went outside despite it. I believe there's just less necessity to go outside to see if someone's available, and outside has become increasingly hostile to young people. Thus, young people are going outside less frequently.",unpopularopinion

My mom has red hair and my parents were scared I’d be a redhead because how rough my mom had it as a kid for her hair. Nobody called her by her name. She was always called Pippy Longstocking or firecrotch. One time a doctor asked her when she was 13 if the carpet matched the drapes in the waiting room. I personally won’t have a kid with a redhead because i know my child would be ridiculed for it due to my recessive genes. Race swapped characters seem to always be the redheads. I’m not a redhead thankfully but i remember how much shit the redhead in my grade got through the 12 years of school. Also they’re called soulless.

EDIT: Thank you to everyone who's commented! Even the assholes. Many of your criticisms are fair -- even enlightening -- and some I still disagree with. 

Where the assholes and I agree

- My original post was poorly written. I halfway expected it to drown in the torrent of new posts, plus the topic riles me, so I didn't choose my words carefully. Surprise, surprise: they didn't hold up well under the microscope of /unpopularopinion's front page. 

This is how I would reword its crux: ""not feeling like it"" is a shitty excuse to flake on friends. “Not feeling like it"" due to something foreseeable (you stayed up late the night before watching a football game, you had an important project due at work this week, you never liked the plans you agreed to) doesn’t make the excuse any better. If you're unsure if you'll make it, tell your friend that. Otherwise, flaking isn't self-care. It’s immature and rude.  

- Shit happens to everyone, and especially to parents and people with chronic medical conditions. 

- How someone flakes is relevant. A sincere apology can communicate what a casual cancellation doesn't: the friend who is cancelling still values the friendship.

Where the assholes and I disagree

- One said, ""We don't own our friends' time."" No, but we do owe our friends the time we tell them we'll set aside for them, unforeseen conflicts excepted.  

- Canceling because you don't feel like it right now can be shortsighted because how you feel can often change after you arrive.

- To be angry at a friend who flakes isn't selfish. It's a reasonable response to someone whose poor planning affects you.

- I’d rather my friends stay home if they're too tired to enjoy themselves. But if they're tired due to poor planning, being “too tired” is a shitty excuse to flake.

The rides themselves are just atrocious. Minimum wait times of 2 hours to go on a ride that lasts 3 minutes? If you look at the way these new rides are being built, 99% of the ride is just space for the queue.

We purchased a genie+ pass was just enough to get us on a few rides, the one attempt we made to get on a ride without the genie pass, we waited in line for 2 hours only to have the ride break down (of course Disneyland doesn't do rain checks unless you have a fast pass...)

""I don't want to walk to get groceries"" ""Texas is much too hot walk"" ""schools are too far"" etc etc...

First off, the whole point of a walkable community is your needs like a grocery store are right there. So, instead of going on the grocery store and loading up for a family of four once a week, you swing by the grocery store on the way home from work and grab something for dinner. It also allows food to be fresher and generally of higher quality since you aren't having to stock up for a week or two.

Also, the definition of a walkable community is that schools are of walkable distance OR connected by transportation. 

But also, professional city/urban planners seem to idiotically fundamentally misunderstand walkable communities. In Texas at least their definition is a bunch of expensive apartments with high priced restaurants and bars underneath. Which... cool... but that isn't walkable if you still have to drive 30 minutes to a grocery store or to school or to entertainment or to recreation.

Also many of these walkable communities seem to be designed to be as hot as possible, big cement buildings, huge parking lots, zero trees. Just by eliminating giant flat fields of cement and making sure walkways were adequately shaded, a-lot of summer heat can be mitigated. 

But it seems alot of Americans, and architects/city planners/urban planners, have zero idea what they are talking about in regards to walkable communities.",unpopularopinion

Scientists agreed that it was a waste of time, money and energy. And that money could have been put into something actually useful.

Edit: according to the IUNC about 14 million tonnes of trash get into the ocean every year.

There are 2200 pounds in a tonne so 30,800,000,000 pounds of trash end up in the ocean every year.

996,1709374077.0,“I know myself best” mentality can prevent you from realizing your potential ,"I say this because I’ve seen and experienced it. Before proceeding, I want to make it clear that I think listening to one’s self (whether it’s your body, your intuition, your reasoning) is important. The problem arises when that becomes the main argument for everything. 

I’ve been guilty of telling myself “I’m just too X to do Y…” and, wheree I live, people strongly advocate listening to your own intuition (and frankly, excuses) because it’s your experience. Many argue that everyone’s experience is unique, and we shouldn’t challenge that because we can’t possibly fully understand their experience. While I agree that is generally true, I also believe that people can’t fully understand their own experiences. Not everyone has fully processed all of their life experiences. Often times, people misinterpret experiences and misjudge their abilities as a result. 

Over time I realized that this isn’t very beneficial. Sometimes, you shouldn’t listen to your body and intuition. Sometimes, we need to recognize that biological signs to avoid or stop something are leading us to the path of least resistance… after all, our bodies and minds often look to conserve energy and are averse to risk, which makes sense if you were at risk of being killed by a lion, but that’s no longer a threat. 

Sometimes we should listen to those pushing us, even if it doesn’t immediately feel like the right way to go. Not always, of course, but sometimes.

It was so unsettling looking and not how I want to remember them yet it's stained in my head. I have no idea why this is something we do. It's such a morbid awful tradition. I thought that maybe for his closer family like his siblings it's something they'd want but I started talking them and they very quickly bought up how awful they thought it was and how it was torture having to view it all day during the wake. Who are we doing this tradition for? Funeral homes so they can charge us for it? It makes no sense to me.

I can see how before such easy communication it could be more necessary for closure. But now that we have social media and share pictures and face time all the time it's not like we're at a lack of of ways to remember the image of our loved ones that passed.

Edit: I wasn't traumatized, but my cousins were. One of them even said they had a nightmare involving the seeing the corpse as it was in the wake. I think it truly scarred her. She had no problem accepting the death or the reality of it. Having to view the corpse for that long just made that process more upsetting than it had to be.

Edit: There's a theme that's coming up that some people say it helps people face the reality of the death. Do you really think cultures that don't do a viewing are having any trouble facing the realities of death?

1002,1709354505.0,"Star wars episode 2 is easily the best movie of the entire series, and it's not even close.","I'm first going to begin this opinion with a related one, which is even less popular: the original trilogy is bad. I'm primarily speaking from a narrative standpoint. I'm also speaking as someone who enjoyed watching them.

For their time, the first three visually kicked ass. However, the actual story is weak and lacks nuance. Even taking into account the fetish people had for a Hero's Journey style story at the time, it is very black and white. The morality of the opposing forces is as deep as the plastic tortoise-shaped kiddy pool i had as a youth. One might argue this is due to an intergalactic conflict's ability to align interests, and to a degree they are right, but the interpersonal relationships are boring and highly idealized. Good and bad, dark and light, Blah blah blah. It was fully carried by how cool its premise is rather than quality of material (like Harry Potter). Plus, the protagonist is the gariest of the stus.

I am aware it was created during a different time and pandered to an audience with quite a different outlook on storytelling. I'm sure I will hear about current narrative fads being temporary, but that does not excuse the first movies. The plot is not very creative.

Now some of you might be remembering the story as having a lot more depth, but much of that was retroactively implanted by the existence of the prequels. For once, it is subtly acknowledged that the jedi created Darth vader through the sins of pride and sloth; the characters in the original trilogy seldom acknowledge the role they played in the creation of their own nightmare.

It is this acknowledgement of gray area morality which allows a conflict to become relatable. This is why the hype around superheroes has died down and we have seen a rise in the popularity of the Antihero in the past 20 years: relatability. I would argue that it is only when you truly understand a character's motivation that you genuinely care about their story. In other words, we must recognize similarity to feel fully invested. This is an opinion, I am willing to argue further on it.

Now, moving on to the prequels.

Episode 1 is a gem. The protagonist is more of a diamond in the rough than a gary stu; he is unspeakably talented (to the point where he does seem to have some plot armor), but he is also intrinsaclly flawed from his origins. His reaction to the jedi indoctrination are believable and tragic, and I say this as someone who was raised in a deeply religious household.

See, the jedi were blinded by their pride. They had believed the sith to be gone. They had believed they sat upon a morality which was both incomprehensible and irrefutable to the average being. This led the council of elders to be completely shut off to the progress of idea or tradition within the organization. They knew he was too old to be fully indoctrinated, so instead of adapting to him, they felt content in simply not trusting him to adapt to them. 

Episode 2 showed the error of this judgement; and, more than that, it showed why he might desire to be Darth vader. First, let's look at the irony of his mother dying. The jedi silently condone slavery to avoid making political waves. Their desire to mold anakin's mind into a machine somehow translated into never saving his mother, or any other slaves. They have the means, but they view their role in the galaxy as beyond such run-of-the-mill wrongdoing. They are willing to let her live through constant suffering to reshape the psyche of another being into their image. I'm not even speaking on bringing anakin and his mother back together; they won't save her for her sake, yet they're willing to let her die for their purpose.  Sloth. Their inaction is still an action.

We see his descent into darkness through the entire movie. His doubt of the orders given to him is constant. His belief in the principles he is told he should stand for is quaking. His admiration for a council unwilling to grant him even a semblance of respect is tragic. He is alone in this world; a man whose only notion of family is left wetting the sands under tusken bootstraps. So of course he killed them. Not just the men, but the women, and children too.

He wasn't the only one to detach from the order either. Count Dooku, the plot's most powerful pawn, left as well. As with Anakin's betrayal, it had selfish motivations, but it all stems from the gilded commandments of the force cabal. The order seems to believe that shutting off the parts of your own being that relate to the negative sides of the force has no consequence, but Jungean psychology obviously disagrees.

Suppressing one's shadow will only grant it further control over one's actions and thoughts. Dooku forsook a lavish life to become a jedi, only to later betray the jedi in pursuit of a lavish life. Anakin forsook human connection to become a jedi, only to later betray the jedi in pursuit of human connection. The luminous order of sages feared its own shadow. Beautiful.

It is seeing the change from anakin to vader occur throughout the movie which makes it so good, and that is because it makes the entire 6 movie story relatable. Sure, the metamorphosis officially occurs later, but this is when he mentally became vader. And that's why I think episode 2 is also better than 3. We see the culmination of the foreshadowing, and it is an epic capstone, but I think episode 2 was nothing short of brilliant. 

I do not like the sequels, but I will save that for the comments or another day. Rip me apart.

1005,1709336375.0,"""Learn to code"" is a movement that is negative for the people learning, and the people who already know how to code.","Picture this. You're an executive of a medium-large tech company. You want to cut labor costs. What do you do? ""Learn to code!"". Everyone can do it man. Imagine, super high pay, super relaxed work, super remote-ness or whatever.

Here's the reality of it though. ""Learn to code"" is a movement oriented towards reducing labor costs for these positions. And it led to the inevitable crash of the tech job market circa 2022-2023 (the job market I graduated into, so I'm a bit biased).

There's a lot more to software development than leetcodes and knowing how to code. In fact, knowing how to code isn't really much more than the prerequisite. If you're going to apply to an engineering position, it is assumed you know math. If you're going to be a software developer, it is assumed you can code. This is the default. You cannot ""learn to code"" and be a good developer. It is not that simple.

However, I am of the opinion that most people, including executives, and the market at large, are so not-clued-in to this fact, that they've managed to create a push for everyone to learn to code. Everyone should know how to code! And, in the process, relaxed their hiring to permit basically anybody that was capable of this very basic, drab sort of skill you just need to have.

Partly just due to the fact that they're unaware of how much really goes into architecting, designing, and building a large software system. Every subpar implementation or mistake is one that is built upon. If you're not careful with how you do things, your house of cards is built upon something untenable. And when you go to reconstruct that house of cards, you must also reconstruct every brick laid upon it in the process. That's how it works. That's why it is expensive. That's why you need people who have been through it before--Who know better.

There's an overwhelming position that people hold that it is all about writing code. Wrong. Writing code is the least significant part of the job in actuality. That's why you're a software engineer, not a code monkey.

The average software engineer writes 1000 lines of code in a year. I can write 1000 lines in my sleep. The difference is, their 1000 lines is highly vetted by peers, highly scrutinized, and it is ensured that it is going to cause as-minimal-as-possible issues later.  They put effort, research, and made sure that those 1000 lines was worth 10,000 lines of mine. My 1000 lines is trash by comparison.

I don't think everyone should learn to code. It is brutal to set these unrealistic expectations that simply ""learning to code"" is all you need. That is far from the truth. A computer science degree even--Literally it confers NO PEDIGREE whatsoever in software engineering. It confers a pedigree in problem solving, which is attractive, that is it. It proves you know how to code--But as explained before, that's a very basic checkbox you have to hit to even apply to a job.

And it is also stupid to continue hiring people with the bare minimum of expertise required, to try to lower labor costs. In reality, what will occur, is your large project will fall into shambles. I understand that cheap intellectual labor costs are super attractive to executives or whatever. But someone needs to shake them awake. It isn't that simple. It isn't that easy. If it were, people wouldn't be paid nearly as much to do it.

Don't laugh the guy away who asks for $140K. He's not asking for that much money because he isn't worth it. He knows 100% what he's doing.

No, you can't ""learn to code"" and be good. Being a software engineer is a lifetime of learning. If you're anything less than completely committed to that, it isn't the job for you. For many of us, it isn't about the pay, or the remote work, or being lazy. Call it a purity test or what you want--I know how to separate engineers from people who want an easy out, from my personal experience in the field. Leetcodes will get you nowhere. They are, quite honestly, the bare minimum.",unpopularopinion

Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of people who this truck isn't meant for, and it is fine if those people don't like it. However, as an experiment in automotive design and technology, it is a marvel, and it doesn't deserve the hate it receives, especially from people who would never buy an EV truck in the first place since it wasn't made to suit you anyway.

Here is where I think the problem lays - No matter what Tesla as a corporation decided to do as far as design, it wouldn't have won in the court of public opinion because people are too devotedly opposed to anything that Space Karen is involved with, and they see the truck as him rather than as the truck that it is. Right now, the opinion is it is too out there, it is too loud and ostentatious, the design is stupid, it is a sore thumb design, or whatever else. On the other hand, however (disagree with my hypothetical to prove your hate isn't blind, whatever, I stand by this) if they had simply taken the current established Tesla design language and ""truck-ified"" it, the same ~~number of~~ people would complain that Tesla is lazy and can't come up with something new. If Tesla had taken queues from legacy truck designs, the same ~~number of~~ people would complain saying Tesla lacks innovation.

It's so stereotypical cartoon villain. Then he says that line about eating liver with some beans and then makes that noise ""fa fa fa fa"". really? is he playing an intellectual serial killer or an evil wizard from a children's book? and then he says the line ""you should go now (or something) fly fly... fly fly... fly fly..."" oh my god it's so funny and not creepy at all. why are you repeating what you're saying like it's an echo? it's like tiktok content.

I have seen friends and family that are in their 30s+ but still behave as they did in their teens/20s. 

for example, i know someone who has always been quick to react, wants all the juicy gossip, and acts like an entitled princess. She is married with kids but her marriage is hanging on by thin strand and she has managed to destroy many of her relationships with others. All because she is stuck in her ways. 

if you don't grow up by your 30s, you are gonna live a miserable life or struggle. It is also a lot harder to change habits as you get older. 

Edit

Having your shit together definition:

- Being able to have confrontational conversations in a calm and respectful manner
- being a civil and contributing member of society (e.i don't be a Karen or litter)
- treat your partner and their family with respect. 
- cut out drama and toxicity
- have a stable job
- change bad habits (e.i smoking or eating junk)
- over come your insecurities

1024,1709237074.0,Lord of the Rings Theatrical Releases are better than the Extended Editions.,"Let me first say that LOTR are my favorite movies and I grew up loving everything about them. The world, the characters , the story, the art direction all make up a modern cinematic masterpiece in my opinion. 

Everyone swears by the extended editions as the only way to watch LOTR, but I believe that the theatrical releases are superior. The theatrical releases have better pacing, they flow better, and they are more rewatchable.

The extended editions, while worth watching at least once, don’t add a ton to the story. Sure, they add some interesting details and they help world building, but as a part of the movie they bog down the pacing, and they make already long movies even longer, which makes it harder to rewatch. There is a reason that those scenes were originally cut. The theatrical releases are perfectly edited to trim the fat and create a well paced, epic motion picture experience.",unpopularopinion
1025,1709226850.0,"Video rental stores must be unique and unusual, especially in order to survive","Sure, streaming services have made brick-and-mortar video rental stores outdated and obsolete and caused such stores to go out of business and chains to go bankrupt.

However, I think rental stores that have closed suffered from factors below:
* Doing same strategies that streaming services have done better, like usual and repeated genre cataloguing, and aiming at casual customers more than niche ones
* Owners lacking passion for movies, more concerned about making profit
* Inability to adjust to limited space
* Never done anything unique and different from a then-typical rental store
* Plenty more that I'm unaware of

The surviving independent rental stores have done something unique:
* chasing after rare movies, especially ones not on streaming
* valuing movies distributed by boutique labels (like Criterion Collection and Vinegar Syndrome)
* unique sub-cataloging (usually by directors)
* using visuals for sub-cataloguing
* aiming at groups neglected by streaming services
* using VHS tapes still for rental, especially rare ones

I think newer and surviving stores should do something never done before by any other store or streaming service if they want to survive, like:
* unusual (un)written policies
* unusual catalogues
* reserve at least one bookcase for temporary cataloging, like anything celebratory
* unique interior design

Video rental stores can't do same things that streaming services have been doing: chasing after casual viewers. They can't do same things that no longer make them viable.

I looked around stores that were gonna close, and their style has been lackluster.
* Interior design is dull and bland and plain.
* Their cataloguing style is not something I've never seen before
* Their business model seems more concerned about and somewhat resembling video chains at the time, never predicting how streaming services made the model outdated

In short, video rental stores that were less unique and more like smaller versions of video rental chains at the time (e.g. Blockbuster and Hollywood Video… and Family Video) have not survived to this day. The only ones surviving are, from what I've seen, doing something unique and different, unlike video rental chains and then streaming services.",unpopularopinion

1028,1709214997.0,Cryptocurrency will be everywhere in the future,"I don't know which particular cryptocurrency(ies?) will exist but I'm sure it will catch on as a technology. Most people do not realize that crypto is currently in a wild-west experimental stage so when they criticize cryptocurrency, they often end up criticizing non-essential aspects of it. For example the claim that crypto is bad for the environment is false, what's bad for the environment is proof-of-work. When ethereum switched from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake it managed to reduce its carbon footprint by 99%. Another claim is that crypto is volatile and bought only for speculation. Again, this is only a subset of cryptocurrencies, there's a whole class of cryptocurrencies called ""stablecoin"" which specifically aim for stability. You cannot even say that all crypto is fiat. Some cryptocurrencies are backed by actual gold (like Tether gold) so it's basically a more ""real"" coin than the dollar. When you have a wild experimental environment like this, there is always some final product. Maybe we will end up with a cryptocurrency that incorporates all of the above features. After all, algorithms keep getting better, computers keep getting faster and energy production methods keep getting cheaper. It wouldn't be the first time that peer-to-peer technology has massive socioeconomic effects (look at piracy). 


Now that the technological aspect is out of the way, there's the incentive aspect. Inflation is pushing people to alternatives. The more the FED prints money and devalues the dollar, the more readily the people will want to abandon the dollar.

1032,1709173117.0,"actors aren't crucial, good script >Good editing> good actors.","I believe there's a pass line that 30% of actors can cross. Once they cross it, it's hard to differentiate the levels of acting skills.

Above this line, the distinguishing factors are only your number of fans and your suitable genre: Action Hero,Romantic Idol,Comedy Actor,aged Sage,etc

The quality of the script matters much more; I've had enough of all sorts of superhero scripts over the past two years.Everyone is doing all sorts of absurd things. The better the acting of a character, the more absurd it appears.

But film editing might save an actor's performance or ruin a good script.When good editing allows us to overlook what expressions the actor's face carries, bad editing can also make a good actor's actions look clownish (when someone edits out the actor's loss of their loved one, and we only see them mysteriously crying).

I'm not really trying to prove my point; it's just a conclusion I've drawn after watching many movies. I've heard that because Schwarzenegger couldn't make expressions, Cameron had him play the Terminator, and I've seen many terrible movies starring Nicolas Cage.

1056,1709068318.0,Children and Animals are Actually a Horrible Judge of Character,"I used to hear this old adage all the time, and I've heard it a few times recently, and I think it's the furthest thing from the truth: **""Children and animals are the best judges of character""** or **""Children and animals know who's a safe person and who isn't.""** I think it's utter horse shit. 

I really don't like how people seem to judge others by the reactions animals or children may have around them. I've seen it in real time. A couple hands their baby to someone, the baby begins to cry, and the parents practically recoil from the person as if they hurt their baby. In reality, the child probably just didn't want to leave mom and dad. This will happen with animals too. You don't instantly mesh with someone's cat and they get the ""ick"" and don't want to hang out anymore. The truth of the matter is that everyone, humans of any age and animals, all have unique personalities and need time to get to know one another. (What I'm not talking about is when your child has a uniquely uncomfortable reaction to someone or tells you outright they're uncomfortable. Obviously watch out for and protect your babies. I don't trust anyone blindly.)

The opposite is also really weird. People assume that if their child takes a liking to an adult that they must be okay. Predators and abusers use this kind of thinking to their advantage. I've, unfortunately, seen this firsthand. 

My grandmother is known throughout the family to be extremely abusive in nearly every way, but all of the kids in the family adore her and think she's the best person to be around. Animals are the same way with her and she's an animal abuser too. She's not the only example I've ever seen of this, but definitely the closest to me.

I personally think its a waste of space because in many cases if someone were to pass away and leave the home to their children, they are typically forced to sell the house unless the HOA of the community isnt dead set on keeping all people under 55 out. Not to mention the plethora of homes that would become accessible on the market, could drastically cut home values which would lower overall costs. There's atleast 8 of these communities within 10 miles of my general area. 

EDIT: When i said 280k as lowest, thats a 600sqft shed on a small plot of land. 350k-400k will get you a new development home and all of the already existing homes can basically start at 450k and up. Average home price in my area is half a million.

Also, im speaking strictly on homes. Condos and apartments would be ideally the best solution for 55+ housing, while cheap double wides and manufactured homes would be ideal as starter homes for young families.",unpopularopinion

But I can find no such justification for criminalizing the act of copying. Proper attribution can be defended I think, but if you recite a poem to me and I go home and write it down from memory, then xerox the paper and give a copy to a friend, I don't think one can establish any wrong has been committed without needing to first adopt a moral premise that is either inconsistent or not widely held by most humans.

If you disagree, I'd be curious on what basis you imagine a logical case could be made for such a moral position.

It's not to protect jobs or the economy, since technological advancement always disrupts that. After all, think of all the typewriter repair people who lost their jobs, or all the jobs now done by machines.

It's not a theft of anything that someone has. You might argue that it's a removal of a possibility for them to have something in the future (money), but we don't punish people for making choices that alter the future generally speaking. ""Theft of future possibility"" is just too vague and undefined to use it in any kind of logical argument for a moral duty.

I think most people heard the cover first and when they heard the original it didn't hit the way they liked for the same reason I didn't like the cover. I think that anyone who loves Nine Inch Nails agrees that while the cover is a good one, it doesn't have the power or convey the emotion of the original

1085,1708926789.0,People Hate Advice Because It Hurts Their Ego,"
It seems that many people I've encountered have a strong aversion to receiving advice, often due to its perceived impact on their ego.

Despite the well-meaning intentions of the advice giver, the recipient frequently reacts defensively, perhaps even vilifying the helper in order to shield their own pride. This reaction is rooted in the perception of advice as a critique of one's abilities or knowledge, which triggers feelings of defensiveness and inadequacy. 

The act of accepting advice can be interpreted as an admission of weakness or incompetence, which challenges one's self-image and sense of pride. 

Moreover, the act of giving advice may inadvertently convey a sense of superiority from the advisor, further fueling negative reactions. Ultimately, the discomfort associated with receiving advice often arises from its potential to bruise the ego rather than from the advice itself.",unpopularopinion

A bit of background: I am subscribed to Amazon Prime, Costco, Max, and a local gym.

Subscription serves have been around for a long time, and no one used to complain. They just need to be worth their value to be worth it. For example, Costco has basically been a subscription service for decades. Yet you get your value in your subscription by the money you save by buying in bulk and all the sales. Another example of a good subscription service that has been around for a long time is Amazon Prime. If you are using Amazon frequently then it is worth it to have Prime for the quicker shipping.

The problem most people run into is when they are subscribing to services and not really using them. Which any person who is a normal adult can manage their money going in and out.

1092,1708898349.0,Ultimate Spiderman is the best spiderman,"Post is flagged with ""Spoiler"" because I kind of spoil the show ""Ultimate Spiderman"" a little bit on the post, so be aware of that

Most people say Tobey's Spiderman is the best live action Spiderman, and Spectacular is the best cartoon Spiderman, but I come here to digress. Ultimate Spiderman from the disney show is far better than any other version of spiderman i've ever seen. I know this is a really bold take, but this is the correct subreddit for this I think.

Most people really dislike the Ultimate Spiderman show, but I love it. The jokes are all awesome I don't think a single one of them is particularly bad, most are funny. The overall plot gets better throughout the seasons, and I love the Spiderverse episodes and Ultimate Goblin. I think the finale was perfect for the show also.

Overall, when I see Spiderman, this is the kind of spidey I want to see. Funny, making jokes mid battle, breaking the 4th wall. Serious at times when the plot demands it. Tobey doesn't make good jokes and Spectacular isn't on the level of Ultimate.

Tom Holland's Spiderman had a lot of potential but unfortunately they were held back by the other Spiderman movie series(Sam Raimi's and TASM) so they couldn't do something like a Spiderman: The Sinister Six movie which is what I wanted instead of No Way Home

IMO the 2nd best Spiderman is probably Insomniac's from the Marvel's Spiderman games, but that might be because they actually *did* get to do the Sinister Six thing, and it's hard for me to rate only the character forgetting that part. Oh also, Ultimate Spiderman also has several episodes where the Sinister Six come together, and also has in my opinion the best version of Carnage so far. I also love some of the side characters like Nova, Power Man and Agent Venom(Flash Thompson in this show).

I understand why some people may disagree, as they've grown up with more serious versions of the character, but I prefer light hearted spidey 90% of the time, and the other 10%, the same spidey but serious, like in the part where Ben Reilly(Scarlet Spider) reveals Peter's identity to Doc Ock

1108,1708837400.0,Cel colors need to make a comeback,"A lot of digitally colored/animated stuff tends to use colors that I feel are too bright. Pastel colors are too cutesy(and have been ruined for me by a lot of internet artists who are bad people), and neon colors are too bright for me and are hard to look at. Shows like MLP, Kiff, and Bluey look bad to me, not just due to the lazy reused designs(in the case of MLP and Bluey), but because the colors used in these shows look too bright and/or overly saturated. The more muted colors from cel-animated stuff and a lot of digitally animated stuff from the 2000s(FOP S1, Ren and Stimpy, Danny Phantom, Animaniacs) look a lot nicer than most cartoons nowadays. Mind you, there are stuff I like the color palettes for that came out in recent years. Lupin the 3rd Part IV looks nice color-wise, and I enjoy the recent Dragon Ball stuff from Shintani recently(ex. Super: Broly), and that upcoming Ren and Stimpy reboot seems to be using colors closer to the original run(even if I wish the character animation was more expressive). The new SpongeBob seasons are well-animated, but they should go back to the S1 colors. Hell, I'd take S2/3 or the 1st movie colors over what we have. It's all my personal opinion, but yeah.

1117,1708814648.0,Git is needlessly complicated,"Git is an extremely useful tool to use when working on any kind of project but for the last 19 years it's been used almost exclusively by software developers. Git is not inherently limited to software projects and can be used as version control for really anything that involves storing files on a computer. Version control software, such as Git, should be as commonly understood by everyday computer users as internet browsers and antivirus software. Git's learning curve is unnecessary and is the main reason why it is not used by everyone. 

Take the command line for example, open up an internet browser and search ""git tutorial"" or ""how to get started with git"". Every tutorial starts by explaining how to use Git's command line interface. I understand that entering commands into a terminal is not technically ""coding"", but to the average person, it looks effectively the same. It's a significant entry barrier that discourages people unfamiliar with the concept to put in the effort to learn it. No other software commonly used by non-software developers requires the user to use the command line for every task. Imagine having to type `word save report.docx` in a terminal window every time you wanted to save in Microsoft Word, or `google revert` to go back a page in Google Chrome. I cannot understand why it is still the default way to interact with Git when it could easily be made to be more user friendly. 

For example, I often use the program ""7-zip"" to compress and decompress files. 7-zip has a command line interface. If I wanted to I could type `7z a` [`file.zip`](https://file.zip) `file.txt` in a terminal window to compress file.txt. However, this is not the default method and does not show up on the first page of a google search. Instead, I can right-click on file.txt in my file explorer, scroll down to 7-Zip in the pop-up menu, and select ""7-Zip > Add to [file.zip](https://file.zip)"". Alternatively, I could use the user-interface that comes pre-installed with 7-zip and compress it from there. Both methods are intuitive and do not require any typing. I don't understand why it's not possible to commit by right-clicking on a Git repository open in file explorer and selecting ""Git > Commit"" in the pop-up menu, or to add a file to the git index by selecting ""Git > Add"". 

I am aware that Git comes pre-installed with Git GUI on Windows, but it looks like it was made in a day using Tkinter. There's no reason for Git not to include a clean, user-friendly graphical interface as part of its default package. I am also aware there are third-party programs like GitKraken that provide a intuitive user-interface. However, the average person is likely deterred before even considering searching for a third-party solution.

To me, Git has always had a strange aura of gate-keeping around it, where it seems intentionally kept needlessly complicated. While it's not difficult to use once you get the hang of it, the initial complexity is kept in to make those who use it feel smarter than the average computer user. 

It's a true shame that Git is not widely accepted as the defacto version control software. Instead, software for non-programmers often have their own built-in VCS. Imagine if Microsoft Office had built in Git support like Visual Studio does? You could create a repository for a class and manage versions for notes, assignments, projects, etc from Word or Powerpoint.

If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read my mini-rant. I'm sure you're all ready to tell me how Git is actually intuitive and I'm just a slow learner in the comments lol.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Git is extremely useful tool for any type of project but its needless complexity makes it scary for people unfamiliar with software development to learn and use.

I can't find a reason why companies choose to artificially limit their stock with products that people can, and will buy.   
Be it the NES/SNES mini, physical collectors' editions for games, art books, dakimakura covers, or literally anything else. There is no reason to not simply offer those items  on-demand after the campaign is over, and if they have a high production cost, the company can just up the price to the point it becomes profitable to sell them, it's not like that's gonna stop the people who really want it.  
I also have a similar opinion on products that are no longer manufactured like old consoles, phones, televisions etc., but that's besides the point of this post.

Now we get to digital limited editions/pre-order exclusive content...  
This is just plain idiocy. It's not like they can simply add said things as DLC, no. They need to sell to you the ""exclusivity"" of having a couple extra lines of code in the game you bought. Or, just having a couple of PNGs that apparently constitute as an ""Art book"".  
There is no way to limit digital content, people are going to either leak it (in the case of things that are standalone), or mod it into the software.

Now, for the conclusion, there is one type of artificial scarcity that I don't have as much of a problem with, and that's backer exclusive physical goods.  
This is because the people who get said products actually helped the project that they backed come into fruition. It is the way that the people who received crowdfunding thank their supporters, that believed in the project that was proposed. It's the way they can say ""It's thanks to you that we got this far.""  
Of course the scarcity is still purely artificial, and anyone with the design documents and contacts in manufacturing can still make them, but it's more about the connection between the backer and the product than the goods themselves.",unpopularopinion

1150,1708674282.0,Small business owners are often insufferable people,"They look down on people who don't own their own business.  Think of all of the times you heard the phrase ""I want to be my own boss"" or "" I don't want anyone telling me what to do"" or they want out of the 9 to 5 rat race.  They look down on people who get told what to do and aren't their own boss.  They're out there living the dream in their own mind looking down on employees.

Ironically, they're their own boss but are being told what to do by the customer and market demand.  If they truly did what they wanted to do and it didn't align with demand they'd go broke.

We're supposed to priase them for ""taking a risk"" to start their business, that's like praising a gambler for betting all of his money on black at the roulette table.  Or praising a well-off trust fund kid for starting something when there wasn't much risk to begin with.

Not to mention small business owners could easily be criminals.  Why don't they want to work for a company?  A criminal record?

Another example: skateshops.  People say buy from your local skateshop, but sometimes the owners of those shops are elitist pricks who look down on beginners.  Why should I make them richer when they don't give a shit about me?  I'd rather get a better price online or just go to Zumiez at the mall to support employees who are just normal people trying to get by rather than making some elitist prick richer.",unpopularopinion

Approaching my fifties and from what I’ve seen from those my age and older, the saying “you can’t teach an old dog new tricks” seems a more apt description of getting older. Just from my experience, I’d say most don’t get wiser. I’d say most keep the same values and perspective of the world that they had in their 20s or 30s and from then on they just force new information to fit those views.

Anything wise is also often stuff you already knew (e.g., put family before work) intuitively anyway. An older person saying it doesn’t make it more true than you knowing it when you’re 20. Oh but they’re speaking from a place of experience so it means more? Why does it take hearing something you already knew to be true, from someone who’s experienced it, for you to take it on board?

1158,1708614792.0,There's too much singing on modern mainstream animation.,"In general, there's nothing wrong with a musical animated show/movie. Some of my favorite shows like Bob's Burgers, the Simpsons, and Morel Oral have musical episodes, or devote time specifically for the characters to sing. It can be fun, especially if the voice actors can sing.  
  
That being said, there really should be less of it. There should be more adult animated shows that don't do songs every episode. Animated kid's shows/movies don't have to end in a dance party or sing to progress the plot. It seems like a factory standard to do it that way. (Especially in the West.)  
  
The Into the Spiderverse series is a great example of using music to enhance the experience. Miles singing along with the first song then not again for the rest of the movie was fun! It was a hint of his character, and we still got to experience the music! It's just one example, but there could be more that's done to keep music in without adding singing. 

It kind of seeps into indy animation as well. It's as though you can't have anything mainstream (or for general audiences) without it having the musical type progression.

1159,1708582899.0,Darth Vader is an exemplary leader,"Everyone thinks of Darth Vader as the ruthless bad guy who kills everyone who opposes him. But he actually shows very strong leadership traits:

* While he is the most powerful individual in the Galactic Empire after the emperor, he does not lead from an ivory tower. He gets his hand dirty. A rebel fleet is attacking the Death Star? Not only he is in a fighter with his fellow pilots, he actually shoots down most of the enemy ships himself. He is in there to capture rebel leaders, to fight Obi Wan Kenobi, etc. He could very simply have sent a bunch of grunts, but instead he is in the action.
* He is humble and does not tolerate arrogance and bullshit. When everyone is bragging how badass the Death Star is, he brings everyone down to earth and remembers how it is insignificant in the grand scheme of things. And he was right.
* He is resourceful. He doesn't care about hiring bounty hunters, which the empire leadership considers ""scum"". He does what needs to be done to get the job done, and in that case, the job got done.
* He does not tolerate incompetence among people who were put in a leadership position. When he chokes the generals to death, it is not because of pure villainy. It is because his general's bad decisions put unnecessary risk to empire , like alerting the rebels the Empire is coming to Hoth (which required a ground assault, costing men's lives).
* He also takes the time to go personally to the guy who is building the new Death Star to warn him ""our boss is pissed,  you'd better go back to schedule"". He is a bro trying to help his buddy before it is too late.
* On the other hand he promotes individuals who are smart. Like the dude who read a strange signal from the probe droid which might have indicated the rebel base was in Hoth.

If you are smart and humble, you will do fine by having him to your side while crushing the rebel scum.",unpopularopinion
1160,1708582274.0,Negotiating is dying/dead in the age of algorithms.,"Recently bought a used car. I was only able to negotiate on my trade in because the company I bought it from used an algorithm to price match the cars to the estimated market value. I was told new cars there is allowances to negotiate, but that used had none. 

I think in a few years negotiating will just be done. Mainly because information is so accessible that sellers can access historical data on what people are buying things for. 

This extends to negotiating salaries. A few places I know in the tech industry just do yearly salary increases just under inflation. And the job market (at least for tech) always seems to have people willing to do a job for less than what it should be priced at. 

My professors in college used to tell me to take any job I could get and live out of my car to be able to afford to work. It wasn’t find a job that can help you pay rent, it was become homeless so I could maximize my paycheck. 🤦🏻‍♂️

Textbooks are more linear and gives better explanations in my experience, while the internet is a mess for navigating as it's essentially a jigsaw of information. This becomes a problem with more complex questions, I’m not saying the module in of itself is unsuccessful. That's simply how it's designed, not a criticism as it's how you make of it.

It's hard to find specific explanations despite one thinking ""everything is on the internet"" (that or it takes a lot of digging) while textbooks its easier to trace your steps with an issue. (I'm talking more about STEM, so humanities may differ.)

I understand why curbside pickup was necessary a few years ago, but the volume of people still using curbside pickup has led grocery stores to have half or more of their employees working on collecting items in these towering aisle-blocking carts. These carts are so huge that you can barely squeeze by them with a cart, not to mention the employees that stand by them who always seem to be oblivious to the people around them and are likely incentivized by some sort of time constraint to fulfill orders quickly. Between the employees gathering items and the regular shoppers trying to navigate around them, aisles become inaccessible for minutes at a time, and often there's an employee in each of the most trafficked aisles at any given time. One of the most annoying things though is that their mega tower carts are almost never full, not even close, so they could easily switch to skinnier carts, which would be a lot easier than the store widening the aisles. I've noticed that it's worse at places like HEB where there's a dedicated curbside pickup compared to locations like Walmart where there's a pickup option but you have to come into the store to get it.",unpopularopinion

There’s nothing wrong with it, I just don’t like it, I know it’s normal 

No, I don’t find you gross if you drink that way. I literally couldn’t give a fuck. Just don’t drink out my bottle that way, and even if you do I’m not going to say anything to you, I just won’t like it

No this doesn’t hinder me in my life. If I absolutely have to, I will put my mouth on the bottle, or I will drink out of someone else bottle. I’m not gonna make a big deal out of it like a kid lol

Sure, banning plastic bags might seem like a step in the right direction for the environment, but is it really?

1194,1708434681.0,"Elementary was not only a better show than Sherlock, but a more faithful adaptation of the spirit of the source material","Probably old forgotten news to most but basically there were two shows about Sherlock Holmes that aired at the same time, the BBC Sherlock and CBS (?) Elementary.
I watched most of elementary and tried to get into Sherlock but just couldn't. So my two cents on the matter is:

The episodic formula of elementary is far more faithful to the original Sherlock Holmes book series where most cases were separate and you can pick up and enjoy any book any time. While Sherlock to me felt like it's getting too convoluted with all the characters and over arching schemes in the background to fully just have the same feeling of ""oh this sounds like a more interesting case, I'll jump into that.""

Elementary also just felt like a more natural and believable setting for a modernized Sherlock Holmes and how a character like him will behave in the current world of police and detective work. It makes it more believable that in our times with how strict in procedure investigations are that Holmes will be brought as someone to bring an extra perspective, some interesting specific knowledge and not the police basically getting on their hands and knees like in the British version for Sherlock to degrade them look into it and say ""you absolute dafts, you jolly molly apes, he usually uses his right hand"".

And on a more personal lever, just in view of the genre as a whole. Evey detective and crime show always runs into the problem where the writers wrote themselves into a dead end and basically need to write in a hail marry, in Sherlock it was a boomerang in elementary it was just funny seeing Sherlock have to ""pay"" fo these kinds of things from hackers, added a nice twist of self reflection to it all",unpopularopinion
1195,1708413628.0,Random encounters are better than field encounters in turn based rpgs.,"People hate random encounters. It's probably the biggest complaint people have about older rpgs (and has been a complaint for about as long as the genre has existed). Lately more and more rpgs are moving to having field encounters (also called symbol encounters) which happen when you run into an enemy on the field. I hate this trend and think it's a far worse alternative than the old random encounter system.  


With random encounters there's no way around them, and as such if the game's difficulty curve is well-designed and it's signposted well the developer can have a general idea of how many encounters someone is going to run into on the way from objective to objective. It might vary slightly from player to player, but by and large the developer can guess the average number of enemies a player is going to fight and around what their level will be and tailor the difficulty to it.  


With symbol encounters you have none of that. Since players can choose when and where to fight then do you balance around the player fighting every enemy or avoiding most combat? I don't like having to guess what the designer's intent is and whether they want me to fight everything I come across or just the occasional battle.  


It also totally strips out any kind of resource management challenge from gameplay. In older rpgs getting through a dungeon isn't just about beating the boss. You have to be able to get through the dungeon, defeat the boss and get out all without running out of resources (health, magic, healing items, etc). If you can just run past every enemy then that's no longer something that's really much of  factor in gameplay.  


You could argue that you can still have all these things by just creating field encounters that are difficult or impossible to avoid, so that way the player will still need to fight some enemies from time to time. But if that's the case how is that at all different from random encounters?",unpopularopinion
1196,1708410650.0,“PM” or “Private Message” is a far better phrase to use than “DM” when messaging someone 1-on-1.,"A “PM,” or “Private Message,” is exactly what most people mean when they say “DM me” or similar. Private Messaging (PM) is a 1-on-1, _private_ conversation between two people on a messaging platform.

It makes no sense at all to tell someone to “DM” you when there’s more ways to directly message someone than to privately message someone. The most obvious way tagging the person in question on a social media platform. “Direct” does not mean “private,” so tagging someone in, or commenting their name underneath, something like a meme or post you enjoy is “directly” messaging, or “DM”ing them, just as much as starting up a 1-on-1 chat is. 

We should bring back “PM” as the way to say we’d like to communicate 1-on-1, as it has a much clearer meaning (privacy) than the broader “DM,” which can be used to just draw someone’s attention to an item of interest regardless of it being 1-on-1 or on a public forum for all to see. It might also re-wire brains to the point where people stop posting private, potentially intimate messages where they can be seen all over the world.",unpopularopinion

1198,1708405117.0,The 2024 NBA ASG was not as bad as people are making it out to be,"I keep seeing posts online about how the nba all star game was boring because no defense was being played as usual. I’d argue the game was so boring because the East was shooting the 3 ball much better than the West. The defensive effort started off acceptable for the ASG. 

When the game first started, the starters looked liked they were putting in effort on defense. First score of the game: Giannis attacked the basket guarded by KD, Lebron moves over to help, Giannis passes it to Tatum in the corner for a wide open 3.

From there on, both teams were playing  defense when the players were set. Transition defense (fast breaks, half court passes straight from throw in, cherry picking, etc.) are where the players were lacking and that’s understandable for the first quarter of an ASG.

The issue was the 3 pointers. Players on the East started taking and making impressively difficult 3s. The defense by the West definitely wasn’t their best but it’s not like they just stood around and watched. A lot of the shots the East were taking are shots that would be ill advised in a regular game. The West accordingly, weren’t playing the defense seen in a regular game.

And by the second quarter when the East was leading by like 12+ points. Anytime the West went on any sort of run, someone on the East went and made a 3 to kill the momentum. That’s when the defensive effort started to drop significantly and it became a joke. It essentially became another 3 point contest. Players aren’t going to go 100% down 20 in the third quarter for a game with little to no incentive. When they do try like KAT did, they get clowned online.

Matter of fact throughout the whole game, KD put in the most effort on defense. He also probably had the most points scored on him. I can recall like 5+ times where a player on the East iso’d with KD defending and made a 3 over him.

People are recalling the 2020 ASG but that game isn’t comparable because of the circumstances. The game was competitive in the fourth quarter because both teams had a shot at winning it. 2024 ASG was over by late second quarter.

TLDR: The problem with the ASG has less to do with defensive effort and more to do with the 3 point shooting and spacing of players during the game.",unpopularopinion

Since library books are shared property, some consider it kind of sacrosanct and that you should do your best to keep it in the same condition you checked it out in. 


I generally agree, but I think that marking up a book actually can enhance it in some ways. Notes in margins can provide extra context, references for further reading, etc. Underlined sentences can help the reader pay special attention. 


Since it's essentially communal property, this makes for a somewhat communal reading experience. I'm pretty sure some e-book apps even do something similar, like underlining a portion and telling you that lots of other readers have highlighted that.


I'm not even necessarily saying this should be like an official policy change. In my opinion it's cool, and I think there can be concrete benefits to it.  


It also creates a sort of shared history with previous readers, which can go back decades. Almost like being in an anonymous book club, just connected by the library and the book.


I would also say this is mainly for non-fiction, it would be distracting for fiction. But I only really see it happen in non-fiction, particularly older books which I'm guessing are often marked up before the library even gets them. ",unpopularopinion

1207,1708354019.0,The Steph Curry vs. Sabrina Ionescu 3-point challenge was a joke,"First, I want to acknowledge that Ionescu is a phenomenal 3-point shooter, the best in WNBA history. Her near-perfect WNBA skills 3-point contest was out of this world and it was amazing to watch.

With that being said, setting up a Curry vs. Ionescu 3-pt challenge was a joke. Not only are we comparing apples and oranges (WNBA balls are smaller), but this feeds into the false narrative that ""WNBA players are just as good as NBA players and deserve equal pay"" although they generate a deficit because they still believe that they could fill 20,000-seat arenas.

What's more, Kenny Smith (I believe it was him) commented on Curry's win by saying that ""Ionescu should be shooting from the WNBA 3-pt line, that would make it fair."" What a joke. The WNBA refuses to lower the rims, yet they use smaller balls, and now this comment. The hypocrisy is beyond me.

I'm glad that Curry eked out the win. Could you imagine the endless WNBA gloating had Sabrina won?

I don't know, maybe it's me who likes that the beings who love me do so for who I am and not for simply existing and because they are indoctrinated or created to love me just because. And maybe humans feel and think the opposite of me because they feel that they should be loved no matter what for being them, and this is why this is an unpopular opinion I guess.

If someone wanted to have a fight, and the option was a long sword or a colt 1911, which one would you say was more civilized? Brutally stabbing someone to death and cutting open their stomach, or shooting them in the head and instantly killing them?

I get the logic, lightsabers take an incredible amount of skill to wield effectively, same as a long sword. Just like a long sword, a lightsaber has multiple styles of fighting, while a gun and a blaster are point and shoot. But I don’t think using a melee weapon to painfully kill someone is more civilized than shooting them and killing them quickly and efficiently. Taking a lot of skill doesn’t make something civilized. Rock slings take a fuck ton of prowess and practice to use, but that shits primitive as hell because you’re literally throwing a rock at someone. Guns and blasters are objectively more civilized because of the lack of pain most of the time, if you shoot to kill, versus the brutality of a lightsaber or bladed weapon. It’s civilized because you’re minimizing suffering and killing effectively, versus the long, drawn out battles with a blade or lightsaber (even though most sword fights historically were over quickly).",unpopularopinion

1225,1708280785.0,Movies where the bad guy dies at the end are unsatisfying,"They're only satisfying if you believe there is some sort of punishment after death. But if you don't, and instead believe nothing happens after death, then there never is any real justice. And even if you do believe there is some form of justice after death you almost never get to see that on screen, you just have to make it up in your head. 

Sure, often times the bad guy has a painful death where they realize they've lost but that lasts a few minutes at most and more often than not they don't go through nearly as much pain as they've caused to others.

Take the movie Unhinged with Russel Crowe for example (spoilers ahead). This guy murders multiple innocent people in brutal awful ways, traumatizes dozens of others, and devastates countless families. His punishment at the end? Stabbed in the eye and a fairly painful death (although not nearly as painful as many of the on screen murders he did). He never really has to face what he did and see the pain he's caused. Nope, it's just lights out forever for him.

I want to compare two other movies that essentially have the same plot but with different endings. Those movies are Misery (1990) and Run (2020). Both pretty good movies imo. There are plenty of differences between the two but there are also obvious similarities with Run taking plenty of inspiration from Misery. Again, spoilers ahead.

In Misery, a crazy lady stalker fan holds her favorite author captive for months after she finds him in a car wreck. She drugs him, keeps him crippled, keeps him locked in his room, and inflicts severe trauma on this poor guy for months. Oh, and she murders an innocent cop trying to help. She's a deranged lunatic who does awful terrible things to innocent people. Her punishment? A realization she's lost and a fairly painful bludgeoning to the head. She never has to face the things she did and the pain she caused. I'd much rather she live at the end, get arrested, stand trial, get psychiatric help, return to sanity and have plenty of time to think about the awful things she's done as she rots in prison.

Now let's look at Run. Again, crazy lady holds someone captive, this time her daughter (whom she kidnapped at birth) and this time for nearly two decades instead of a few months. She drugs her daughter to keep her crippled, shelters her from ever having a social life, and as soon as her daughter realizes what's happening she locks her in the basement, tries to poison her and threatens to kill her. She psychologically and physically tortures this poor innocent girl and devastates the family she stole the baby from. Oh, and she murders an innocent mailman trying to help. She's a deranged lunatic who does awful terrible things to innocent people. Her punishment? Unlike Annie from Misery, she lives at the end after getting shot and taking a wicked tumble down some stairs. She gets arrested, she stands trial, she gets psychiatric help, she gets the rest of her life to think about the awful things she's done as she rots in prison (well a maximum security mental hospital but close enough), and most importantly she literally gets a taste of her own medicine. Her daughter frequently visits her and its revealed that each time she visits she drugs her mother with seemingly the same drugs that her mother used on her for years, keeping her paralyzed or whatever. The bad guy faced real life on screen consequences for her action that are just as bad if not worse than the pain she inflicted on her victims. She didn't get a few seconds of pain and a free ticket to oblivion for eternity. And because of that it was a more satisfying ending for the audience imo.

A few things I want to note:

1. This is not an opinion piece on what ""true"" justice really is. I know I used a lot of eye for an eye examples in this but that's only because that's the most common type of ""justice"" used in movies and the only ones I could think of. I don't really care how the writer chooses to portray justice, I just don't like when it's the same old trope that's been used a thousand times where I'm supposed to be satisfied that the bad guy is dead. Any form of justice other than death is a breath of fresh air in my book.
2. I'm not a movie critic and I'm not here to argue about the movies I talked about. Maybe I'm missing what the ""real"" message is in these movies but I don't care. The parallels I made are the only ones I needed to make my point. I'm also not saying any of these movies are bad, I enjoyed all 3 but some endings are more satisfying than others.
3. I'm not here to argue about religious beliefs either. If you believe someone gets what they deserve after death then great, I'm sure you're very satisfied when the antagonist dies. I just personally don't believe in that so death isn't seen as a punishment to me since I don't think experience is possible once you're dead.
4. This logic applies to books, tv shows, any story really, and even real life in certain instances. 

TL;DR: Bad guys don't face real consequences or justice if they simply die in the end because death isn't an inherently bad experience. It's probably not an experience at all. And it's much more satisfying when the bad guy faces real life consequences for the terrible things they've done.",unpopularopinion

1227,1708279883.0,Allison's villain arc in The Umbrella Academy is poorly written.,"Okay, so this rant is gonna be spoilery for the show, so watch it if you haven't yet. (Trust me, it's really good.)

Over the course of the first two seasons, Viktor has done a lot of bad shit, like a LOOOOOOOT of bad shit. Let's see... he's destroyed the world twice, tried to upset the timeline by bringing people from the '60s to 2019, etc. And what does Allison do in response to all this? Nothing. Absolutely. Nothing. She *cares* for this man. It's something that's been apparent since the first season. Even when he slashed her throat in season 1, she gave him no ill will and even asked Luther to release him from the basement (he didn't end up doing it).

Enter season 3. For most of the season, Allison's as supportive of Viktor as she's been the entire show previously. And then episode 6 rolls around. Allison finds out that Harlan, who Viktor was trying to free from his powers, unwittingly killed all the Umbrella Academy's mothers before they were born (except Ben's). In a rage, she kills Harlan, and then, not completely satiated yet, decides to take every last *shred* of her anger out on Viktor, the guy who did nothing wrong, at least not knowingly, and also the guy who she's been nothing but sweet and kind to over the course of the last three seasons, in episode 7. _This is the only noteworthy thing she does the entire episode._ And then it gets worse. In episode 8, Viktor genuinely apologizes to her for everything he did wrong (read: literally nothing), and asks for forgiveness. And Allison, in an act of the BIGGEST CHARACTER DERAILMENT I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE, openly tells him that she can't forgive him for this, by comparison, *little slight,* when she's been MORE than happy to forgive him in the past. THAT is my problem with Allison. It's not a problem with the characters. It's a problem with the writing. Allison's villain arc was written poorly. That's about the long and short of it.

Also, I will defend Viktor until the day I die.

- okra is very nutritious, being rich in vitamin K and C, calcium, and various micronutrients

- it is a natural stew & soup thickener, making such meals heartier and more filling. That “sliminess” that people complain about is a feature, not a bug.

Most importantly, in my opinion, it’s an often-forgotten option to make more interesting meals. We’re all told we need to eat more vegetables, but we settle on the same ones over and over (potatoes, carrots, broccoli, onions).

I understand there are hurdles to this. For one exams are highly personalized to what a professor instructs. Course content is changing and changes need to be communicated. Some curriculums require labs and assignments. But I don’t think any of these can’t be tweaked or changed to fit this new model for people who A) Want to study at their own pace, at their own time B) don’t want to pay the full tuition price for instruction, student fees, and campus faculties.

1236,1708260577.0,"Taco Bell can be relatively decent, wholesome and healthy as fast food, and does not deserve the hate that it gets.","First off, I want to address all the ""Taco bell makes me sick"" jokes, which I believe is just a dumb joke at best and an offensive jab at spicy foods at worst.  Unless you have a specific allergy, spicy food doesn't make you ill, the amount you're jamming down your gullet does.  Which leads me to my next point. 

Almost everything on the menu at  Taco Bell can be ordered with grilled chicken instead of admittedly greasy ground beef.  Then it's topped with lettuce and tomato.  If you went home, grilled some chicken and served it with fresh chopped lettuce and tomato, you'd say you made a healthy meal, but for some reason because it comes in a paper bag we hate it.  

Now where I think people go wrong is how MUCH they order.  Taco Bell has the blessing and curse of being exceptionally cheap.   However, the average 10 dollar meal box you can order pre set is 1000 calories or less.  Not great, but have water instead of soda, again, go for chicken instead of beef, decent meal.  It's when you order the box.  Plus an extra couple of tacos, plus another crunch wrap, plus the weird burrito they have ads for (there's only so many ways you can toast a burrito folks, stop trying to be fancy), then try to eat this all at once, then wonder why you're sweating and your stomach hurts.

1240,1708245492.0,Caffeine pills are a superior alternative to coffee and energy drinks,"Over-the-counter caffeine pills are a much better option than coffee and energy drinks when you need an energy boost throughout your day.

First, there's the price. A single cup of coffee from a cafe will cost you at least $5 or more. An energy drink can cost $2 to $5 depending on what you pick. On the other hand, name brand caffeine pills cost about $10 for a box of 60 and generics are even cheaper. You can get an equivalent amount of caffeine as a cup of coffee for less that a quarter.

Second is the calories. Caffeine pills have zero calories but energy drinks are loaded with sugar and most drinks you'd find at coffee chains these days are essentially coffee-flavored desserts. One drink recently made headlines for having 1,200 calories in a single cup. That's a major source of extra calories in your diet, especially if you habitually drink these every day.

Third is the convenience. A blister pack of caffeine pills can easily fit in a desk, glovebox, purse, or jacket pocket and you can forget about it until you need it. It doesn't require you to take time out of your day to go to a cafe, stand in line, place an order, and wait for a barista to make it and serve it to you. It's just ready immediately.

I say this is an unpopular opinion because nearly every time someone at work has commented to me ""I feel so tired right now"" and I offered them one of my caffeine pills that I had handy, they would recoil and look at my as if I had just offered them hard drugs (I would show them where it says ""CAFFEINE 200 mg"" printed on the package).

I realize that people say they enjoy coffee for the taste, which is understandable.

Software pushes hardware sales. Simple as that. Would it be great if we lived in a utopia where everyone could play every game on one piece of hardware?

1284,1708100755.0,Caitlin Clark will save the WNBA,"- Since its inception in 1996, the WNBA has been a colossal financial failure. In a 2018 financial report, Adam Silver admitted the league had lost an average of $10 million per year ever since it was founded.  Since then the league has started to turn around. The average viewership per game has doubled in that period and , the total revenue reached over $200 million a year. A few individual teams, have even started to become profitable. However despite these great strides, the league as a whole still loses money and has a long way to go before it becomes ingrained in our culture similar to other pro sports leagues. 

Despite 3 decades of disappointment, there is absolutely hope that the league can turn around. That hope is Caitlin Clark. 


This season, playing in college she is averaging 32.8 points per game for the University of Iowa. Next highest scorer in all of woman’s college basketball is averaging 27.7 ppg. Brittney Griner, who is in many ways the face of the WNBA, never averaged more than 24 ppg during her college career. 

So it’s clear Caitlin is dominate, but the question is, if she can really bring in enough viewers to change women’s basketball forever. The answer is a resounding yes. 


So far this year, the average WNBA game has brought in roughly 500k viewers. Last season when Iowa played Louisville in March madness the game sustained an average viewership of 2.49 million. It not just her play off games that are bringing in viewers either. A random regular season game this season against Ohio maintained an average viewership of 1.93 million. Think about that. A regular season college game is more than quadrupling the viewership of WNBA games because of her presence.
 

Iowa is shattering attendance records this year as well. The very first game of this season, Iowa broke the NCAA women’s basketball attendance record, selling 56 thousand tickets
Every road game they have played this season has been a sell out crowd. In all but two of their games this year they have either broken an attendance record or sold out the arena. Crazy.

1296,1708029523.0,The A24 Green Knight movie is not only bad but also completely gets the original story wrong.,"The poem of ""Sir Gawain and the Green Knight"" is a favorite of mine. I love Arthurian literature, chivalric romances, and fantasy movies. How people AT ALL compare the A24 movie favorably to the original poem is mind boggling to me. I can't stand that movie.

An absolutely critical part of the original tale of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is how virtuous and chivalrous Sir Gawain is. He is absolutely regarded highly in society at his time, he's very proper, very polite, and very respectful. He has no lady in waiting, and when the Lord's wife tries to tempt him in the manor, he politely and artfully declines her in ways that would not only stops the potential cheating but even does so in a way that would preserve the standing of him, the lady, and the lord.

It's ONLY when she tempts him with the green sash that would protect him from the Green Knight's strike that he falters in his virtue - AND THIS IS THE POINT OF THE STORY! Even a great and noble person can falter in their virtues in the face of death. When the Green Knight's strike doesn't cut off Gawain's head and the sash is revealed, he comments on this and doesn't blame him for the fear that death puts in men. Gawain is humbled and shamed, and the knights of King Arthur's Court wear green sashes of their own to humorously rebuke Gawain and remember to bring more honor to themselves in the face of death also.

The A24 version of the Green Knight makes Gawain completely and utterly unable to rise to any form of virtue or redeeming qualities. Not only does he get into petty fights and drinks constantly, but he HAS A LADY. Her being a prostitute does not remove the fact that a woman loves him, and he ACTIVELY cheats on her at the first chance he gets with the Lord's wife. She doesn't even need to tempt him with the sash, she JERKS HIM OFF and gets his CUM on the sash. Like an actual CLOSE UP of his CUM on the sash. How people can look at that and say that is ANYWHERE faithful to the original story is so impossible for me, I have tried to see from another point of view and I physically cannot.

That A24 movie is so disrespectful to the original story to me that I can't stand it. How it got rated so highly isn't really that surprising to me, it's very much shot for a modern audience in my opinion. BUT. I love the Northman too, and The Northman shows Amleth completely following the virtues of his people very well - pillaging, murdering, and revenging included. If The Northman can show a viking be a viking, why can't Sir Gawain follow HIS virtues and be a knight, and be chivalrous and respectful?

1297,1708026278.0,"Medical imaging is not overused, but actually the opposite","Many health issues can be detected by high-quality medical imaging, yet the medical field often treats imaging as a last resort, with more fear about the possibility of ""unnecessary"" imaging than concern about lives and health.

Ultrasounds can provide fast and portable imaging for routine screenings, and MRIs are the gold standard for diagnosis of many issues. Neither produces radiation exposure like an X-ray or CT scan. I think every medical practice should be required to have on-site ultrasound for increased efficiency (subsidized by the government if necessary), and that there should be walk-in MRI clinics with minimal wait times.

It's considered normal for cancers to be detected only at an advanced stage, when outcomes are poorer and more advanced facilities are required. Only a small fraction are detected by currently routine screenings, and many are detected after many 'checkups' only when an unrelated accident sends someone to the ER.

We are willing to have colonoscopies to screen for colon cancer, but not a routine liver ultrasound to check one of the most common destinations for aggressive metastatic cancer and damage from metabolic issues, both reversible if caught early enough.

MRIs can detect heart and blood vessel issues and identify some people at risk of heart attacks, heart failure, strokes, and atherosclerosis – a massive number of people – for proactive treatment.

Over 900,000 people in the US have pulmonary embolisms each year, over 100,000 fatally. These blood clots most commonly start as a DVT elsewhere before traveling to the lungs after up to 4 weeks.

One common argument is that imaging will result in unnecessary invasive treatments, but the image itself does not. It is the responsibility of the radiologists and other specialists to make a sound judgment based on them. If there is truly a problem to the point that we should stick our heads in the sand about everything so that doctors don't overreact, the problem is those doctors, not the imaging. Patients having 'anxiety' about findings is also not a valid reason to systemically avoid lifesaving medical screenings. We might as well abolish all routine checkups for the same reason.

But when people complain about algebra, I can't stand it. Can you seriously tell me in your day to day life you've never had to look at a graph? Or that you've never used a simple formula to get an answer? You may not realize it, but when you decided to buy three pizzas for the party you're hosting based on the number of attendees, you just input a variable into the equation (# of pizzas = # of attendees \* average portion eaten per attendee). And the reason you don't think about it like that is because it's so ingrained into your mind - almost like someone did a good job of teaching you it.

Although the game definitely looks very fun and the rhythm-based combat is unique, I feel like a massive factor in the game's success and positive critical reception is the fact that it was released suddenly, with no promotion beforehand.  I can almost guarantee that if Hi-Fi Rush had gone through a normal, modern cycle of gaming promotion it would've had a much less positive reception because of how the world of gaming builds so much hype which just leads to disappointment amongst gamers for literally every game release.

I think Hi-Fi Rush still would have been successful and popular if it had gone through a normal promotion and release, it's not like it's a bad game, but I think the only reason it has had the acclaim it has and the constant use of it as a perfect ""Xbox Exclusive"" is because of the shadow-drop.",unpopularopinion

I’m talking about the west and low context cultures where the first offer is often a real offer. A lot of people express love and affection through gifts and paying for things. It’s no more than saying I love you, or giving a hug. If it’s strange to reject the latter, why would you turn down a gift or offer?

If it’s too much this person wouldn’t offer in the place. It’s hurtful and feels like your expression of love is beneath the person

My concern is over a trend where people seem to think it can be prioritized over other commitments with no consequences.

A couple of things in my life recently have got me thinking about how there seems to be an attitude of entitlement among a lot of people to  travel to resorts in locations like Cuba, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, etc. every winter (speaking from a North American perspective). 

A close friend is a teacher. He says that every week there are 2-3 students out of school for all inclusive resort vacations. That is incredibly disruptive in an already strained school system. The parents use the excuse that they can’t afford the higher costs of travelling during scheduled time off or that they don’t want to go when everyone else is. To me, this is very selfish. It affects not only their child’s education, but also the whole class since it is basically a revolving door. When I was a kid, it was rare for a anyone to miss more than a day or two for an optional vacation, and it was usually something more exceptional like a family wedding or something when they did. I think my family only did two purely recreational vacations in my childhood and everything else was visiting family. I travelled way more than many of my classmates, and it was always during scheduled breaks. 

My other experience is a bit less serious but still bothers me. I participate in a team sport. While it is recreational, it is the type of sport that if people are missing it ruins the practices, and it is actually quite dangerous. At the start of the year, we all made a commitment to attend practices and competitions, obvious exceptions being if you’re sick or injured (though if you can, you show up and watch) or if there is a work related thing you can’t get out of. Then right in the thick of the competitive season, every week someone (and sometimes 2 people!) was gone on a vacation. Add a couple of people who were unfortunately sick, the practices were ruined for everyone else. We had the practice and competition schedule in September. I planned a vacation during a scheduled break. I feel it is unfair of my teammates not to do the same.  If leisure travel is so important to them, then maybe they shouldn’t commit to another recreational activity that requires attendance. 

I recognize other factors are at play (airlines jacking up their prices based on demand, social media causing FOMO). And it is ok enjoy vacationing, but I’m finding the attitude towards it is becoming very troubling.",unpopularopinion

Yk that advice people give? “Just be yourself” but what is “being yourself”? Just doing like you always do, right? Like when you are with close friends or family. 

But now Im thinking that what they call “being yourself” is simply a pattern in behaviour. Im not English so Idk if I said that right. But what I mean is that we all, since out first social interaction, have chosen to act a certain way. E.g. laughing when people mock us, trying to please people, being the sunshine in the group or the one with low energy. 

And after that first social interaction we simply continue to act that way. We repeat the same behaviour all the time till it becomes part of us. 
If one was always giving to friends and never talked bad about anybody others would say “thats just who they are” and when they say “be yourself” they are asking you to act the way you usually act.

But we can break that pattern if behaviour in seconds. Im more of a introvert and sometimes feel socially awkward but I can now go outside and act as if Im some celebrity and behave with absolute confidence. It will not go smoothly, it won’t feel natural but if I keep behaving that way for 3 months straight I can assure you that people will start saying “thats just how he is”

My point is “being yourself” is not TRULY yourself. Yourself is probably when you’re alone in your room dancing to your favourite song. Or crying your eyes out when you’re sad. Expressing yourself without problem. 

If “being yourself” is not real then it doesn’t matter if I start acting like a celebrity or if I do like my introverted self bc its all patterns of behaviour. 


TLDR: when people ask you to “be yourself” its not truly yourself but a pattern of behaviour repeated to much it has become part of you. If its just pattern of behaviour its not truly ourselves since we can break the pattern in a matter of seconds and act a different way. 

Im not sure if Im right about this. Its just an idea I had for a while. If its not clear then I’ll redo the post. Tell me what y’all think",unpopularopinion

CR is undoubtedly one of the greats, one of the best finishers ever. I am in no way trying to say that he was not a great player. But people who think that what Hazard said was silly either didn't watch enough of him play or they simply don't understand football.

Being insanely athletic and having a great shot helped Cristiano reach the hights that he did, but in terms of pure football talent there are plenty of players to name who were above him.

Cristiano doing his little tricks and stepovers never fooled a single player in his entire career. With the ball at his feet he simply was never nowhere close to the best dribblers and playmakers in the game.

1337,1707852135.0,"Meteorologists didn’t “screw up” snowfall predictions, you probably just aren’t following the data and tracking updates closely enough.","New England, I’m specifically talking about you today. I’ve lived here all my life so I know how weird the weather can be. We were supposed to get a bad Nor’easter today that ended up being severely downgraded overnight. Predictably, there were the usual comments and memes about how “weathermen are the only ones who can be wrong and still have a job”, calling them idiots etc or even that they were fear mongering for whatever reasons. I even heard a gas station attendant tell me the meteorologists “have no idea what they’re doing.”

Snowfall amounts can vary greatly from the central part of MA where I live to Boston and RI/Southeastern Eastern MA towards the coast, roughly a 60 or so mile radius yet people here still expect absolute perfection 100% of the time. I’m sure the same applies to the weather in many other regions as well. 

 Most of the time the weather predictions are spot on, and the day to day/weekly 7 day forecasts are usually very accurate as far as predicting temperatures, sun & clouds. I highly doubt you’re looking at the usually forecast and making all your plans despite what the weather stations are saying - It’s usually just the occasional storms than get more media coverage and can be difficult to track that people notice and complain about when their plans get disrupted, especially when they think it was all “for nothing”.

Seriously, just stop. They’re doing the best they can which is a lot more accurate than any of us could predict from our living rooms.

1338,1707850859.0,Xbox losing exclusives is fine,"Okay so obviously theres been rumors lately about the direction of Xbox given the big announcement this Thursday but I wanted to share my view and thoughts/how they've evolved.

At first I thought there'd be no reason to continue to buy an Xbox over the Playstation? Why lower the available catalogue of games available if I can play most/all Xbox games on Playstation but not vice versa?

Now my view is starting to shift, especially given the economy and how expensive life is nowadays. 

Even if the Xbox releases their exclusives or majority of first party games over to Playstation, its still possible to remain an economic advantage to have an Xbox + Gamepass. If a multiplatform game is available on Xbox and Playstation, if Xbox releases it as a part of its gamepass catalogue its still a positive as you'd not have to pay full sticker price of $70 for a game. So imagine rather than having to pay $70 each year for the new COD or whatever, it'd be including with your gamepass membership which also includes your Xbox live. Thats still something that could appeal to a good amount of folks.

Obviously this would be upsetting to some, and rightfully so, but I don't think its the absolute end as some people are making it out to be. In fact, I think it could lead to a hybrid of folks purchasing a Series S, to cover the gamepass, and then use PS5 mainly just for exclusives. 

I'd love to hear your thoughts, but as a person watching their money nowadays I'll still probably grab a  series S as it could prove to be the budget friendly option... Also I think I prefer the xbox controller due to the asymmetric thumbstick placement but I'll go test out a PS5 controller soon.  ",unpopularopinion

1341,1707803471.0,Dating doesn't teach you anything meaningful about the other person - hanging out does.,"This is for people who are ""dating with intention"" and are serious about finding their person. If you're a casual dater or just looking to have a good time - have at it.

For individuals serious about finding a long-term partner, traditional dating methods like activities, dining, and social outings often fall short of facilitating genuine connections. Whether you're doing something exhilarating for a first date or more traditional, all activities tend to showcase the best, most polished versions of ourselves, not the authentic, everyday realities. This approach is performative, and rarely pierces through the veneer of social personas to reveal the true nature of each other.  
  
If your goal is to establish a meaningful, lasting relationship, it's time to reconsider the emphasis on outings and activities. Instead, focus on creating opportunities for in-depth, personal interaction in more intimate settings. The real test of compatibility extends beyond shared hobbies or enjoyable outings; it lies in the ability to connect on a deeper level, discussing personal dreams, vulnerabilities, and values without the distractions of a public setting or activity.  
  
My own experience underscores this point. We've been married 10 years and still going, we have 2 kids, and we go out regularly now - it was beautiful out here in central Florida this past weekend. But in the beginning, we hardly went out at all. I invited her over to my place actually, and our chemistry was intense - and it's only gotten better over time. We went at it right away. We had spent about 2 days talking on the apps beforehand. Once we got intimate, we got real with each other. We shared our secrets, our traumas, our histories. We got vulnerable quick and it set a tone of authenticity right out of the gate.

We spent our time together almost like a FWB situation at first - but it felt like more than just sex to both of us. It was backed by intense intimacy. We let the hormones rage for the first couple months - and yeah we went out here and there too like normal people. But we both always wanted to end things early and head back where we could enjoy one another fully. We're still this way even now.

We both agree, meeting in this way allowed us to bypass the superficial layers typical of early dating activities. Our immediate chemistry and open communication about our lives, histories, and secrets fostered a profound connection from the start. This level of intimacy and understanding is impossible to have on any other kind of date no matter how exciting it may be. In fact, the more ""exciting"" it is, the less you two are actually bonding because of your chemistry and compatibility, and more because you're just doing something fun and exhilarating. Here's the difference I guess. That exhilarating activity? You could have enjoyed that with someone you weren't attracted to just as much as someone you were attracted to because it's the activity itself that was enjoyed - your date's company surely enriched it, but it didn't define it. But you know what you can't do with just anyone? Have an authentic connection. You can't force a romantic or intimate connection. It's either there or it isn't - so find out sooner rather than later.  
  
In essence, dating with intention demands a shift from outward, activity-based interactions to inward, personal exchanges. This approach not only accelerates the process of getting to know someone but also lays a foundation for a relationship built on authenticity and mutual understanding. Traditional dating ISN'T working. There's a loneliness epidemic, most people have numerous negative experiences with dating apps, and there's less people getting married and staying together than ever before. We've lost the plot, and focus too heavily on the superficial then wonder why we're left feeling empty and disconnected with others.  
  
Emphasizing personal interaction over social activities is not just practical; it's a more efficient way to gauge long-term compatibility. It saves time, emotional energy, and resources, allowing you to quickly discern whether a relationship has the potential to thrive. By adopting this strategy, you're not only more likely to find a compatible partner but also to establish a relationship grounded in genuine connection and mutual respect.

Whether you had a good time playing darts with someone, felt the rush together of getting through white water rafting, went on a nice stroll downtown, went out for drinks, had a nice meal together, threw axes... none of that will inform you of if this person is a good life partner. Because when you go to describe your partner, you're not going to list off all the activities and hobbies you have in common, you're going to list off their qualities. You'll find those qualities out quicker, more sincerely, and less performatively in a much more intimate and private setting than you ever will sharing in an activity that you could enjoy as much with a friend, family member, or stranger, as you could a date.

Connection is what we should all be seeking. Shared hobbies are important, but whether you both like to read historic romantic fiction or not should not be given the same weight as how understood do you feel on a deep level. Activities are too often used as a heuristic for connection when in all actuality it just means that you both like a thing. You shouldn't base a connection on liking a thing, you should base it on whether you like each other. Cut out the ""thing"" and focus on each other - ditch outings for innings, and you'll find someone you actually enjoy being with instead of spending your time figuring out whether you even like this person.

1342,1707830460.0,NASCAR does not deserve the flak it gets,"A lot of people I know like watching F1. During conversations with them, the second I say anything about NASCAR at all, I'll get hit with the ""NASCAR is just rednecks going in ovals for hours!"" line. Cue the endless jokes about NASCAR from people who, quite literally, haven't watched an oval race before. (Side note, I'm pretty sure they have no idea NASCAR does road courses too.) If you think about it for more than two minutes, complaining about the ovals not a good argument.

The whole point of these motorsports is competition; it's what makes racing fun. We watch motorsports to see drivers duke it out in their cars, employing various strategies to wrangle for first place. We root for our favorite racers as they compete at breakneck speeds. And, regarding this, the track itself becomes less important. 

It's like if I watched an action movie where two characters were duking it out and having a great fight scene, and then I complained about the boring set. The set doesn't matter, it's the fighting and action that matters. 

So, going back to NASCAR and F1, if you enjoy F1 (or similar) but immediately write off NASCAR for ""only being ovals,"" I urge you to give it a try. You'll see action, you'll see passes and overtakes, and you'll see battles like you do in F1. In fact, you'll arguably see more action, as drivers are allowed more contact, and the ovals pack them in together more, causing more passes and overtakes.

When players are getting mauled, usually one team gets way more calls than the other too. Plus they love to call techs for some pretty asinine occurrences. Like staring somebody down, yelling after a dunk, clapping the backboard. The worst are the double techs when some players get into “and altercation” which usually is just a stare down and a few words.

I think the lamest part of all this is that nobody has beat anyone’s ass for stepping out of line. The referees are so ready to call techs nobody sticks up for themselves, and as a result, you get this bullshit game of “trying to bait” other players.

Often, they ironically speak over the actual victims and catapult whatever story they can get their hands on into a public forum that it desperately does not need to be in. And the people responsible for the consequences of these escalatory actions are rarely held accountable.

There is a reasonable limit to schadenfreude. We often participate when we believe that people won't actually get hurt.

1374,1707675411.0,Almost all actors nowadays are completely interchangeable,"This has been something I've been thinking about every now and then and I will try to explain it the best way I can so try and bear with me. To start, here are some common phrases that don't really make any sense to me:

""xx actor's performance was phenomenal in that movie and deserves an Oscar""

""I hope they cast xx actor for this upcoming movie""

""I love movies with xx actor and will watch it just because he/she is in it""

Now the reason the above doesn't make any sense is threefold:

* The goal of an actor is to get you completely immersed in the story
* Almost every actor in Hollywood now is extremely skilled in accomplishing this
* Any added performance/acting skill once the threshold to get the viewer immersed in the story has been crossed is irrelevant

Let's use one scene in a popular (I think?) movie as an example: Owen Wilson's reaction when his dog was dying in Marley and Me. It was a very sad scene, especially for dog lovers, but I would argue that almost any actor in Hollywood would have made us feel the way we felt during that scene. Let's say for example that the skill required to take us from ""actor playing a character that had his dog die"" to ""actual person losing his dog"" was like a 6/10. My argument is that almost every actor in Hollywood nowadays can achieve this and that anything higher than 6/10 is irrelevant. Once we are immersed in the story and our brains are properly ""tricked"" to see what we are seeing as ""real"" then any level of actor skill above a 6 would not make much of a difference for us. It wouldn't have mattered if instead of Owen Wilson we picked an actor that spent his entire life dealing with the deaths of dogs. Once they cross that 6/10 threshold to get the viewer immersed in the story, no one will notice anything else above that.

Another way of putting this is that it's very hard to notice how great an actor's performance is once someone is fully immersed in the story. I have no idea how ""amazing"" the acting of Daniel Radcliffe is in Harry Potter when he's experienced a devastating event. All I see is a teenage boy dealing with death. You could have replace Radcliffe with any of the similarly-aged actors in Hollywood at the time and again, all I would see is a teenage boy dealing with death. If anything, I would have to un-immerse myself from the movie to start critiquing their respective acting skills, which would take away the entire point of watching a movie in the first place.

So to close this out, I think we are very lucky to live in a time where almost every actor has the skill to get the viewer lost in the respective story they are trying to tell and once that immersion is complete, it doesn't matter how much better their acting is and frankly, it doesn't matter at all what actor you choose to play that role.",unpopularopinion
1375,1707674866.0,OG Broly is better than Super Broly,"Original Broly was a cackling, shit-talking menace the whole time.  Mocked them, threatened to kill Gohan in front of Goku, clothes-lined people, no-sold attacks with a grin, knocked them out of SSJ and still whooped on em,  dragged them through buildings, used Goku like a trampoline, etc. He didn't just mindlessly scream as if he'd been a feral child his whole life. Dude was a straight villain, just fun to watch. Super Broly hands down has the better animation quality and fight choreography in most regards, and Vegeta's frustration/desire to flat put Kill Broly is better than the almost immediate helplessness he expresses in the original. But what makes the original Broly and movies like Super Android 13 special are when the Z-fighters all fight together against a Boss, rather than Vegeta jobbing for a few minutes before Goku steps in to wrap things up. (Goku, Trunks, and Gohan turning SSJ together still goes hard, and we get a cold af entrance from Picolo when he saves Gohan.)

And the 90s/early 2000s hard rock tracks are just fun.

Broly's characterization in both films is still barebones Shonen two dimensional writing; his motivations in Super don't have any more depth, they're just a bit different. Daddy issues and an uncontrollable berserker spirit isn't the Grade A writing people make it out to be when comparing it to the original's, ""FUCK this weak dude for crying so much""/PTSD from what happened. 

Also, Broly being able to even keep up with Super Saiyan God(s) and a non-SSJ Gogeta (not to mention whoop a Golden Frieza for an hour) is just kinda silly, considering what Goku and Vegeta had gone through vs Broly only training with his underpowered dad. I get that it's part of his character/powerset as being the Legendary SSJ, but whereas it was fine in the OG, him scaling up to them in Super is a bit too much.",unpopularopinion

1378,1707670155.0,Dating Apps are Incredible,"Dating apps are great. First off, they're super fun, and incredibly efficient (want someone over 6 feet? Easy! Need to find someone within 15 miles? No problem!). You get to meet all kinds of different people (who you’ve already pre-vetted!) and see if you click -- how is that a problem?   
When I was single, I had the opportunity to go on some great dates and meet wonderful people on several different apps, including my now wife. I’m also going to a destination wedding later this year for a couple that met via *Hinge*, and many, many of my friends have met their partners online without issues.   
Frankly, I would’ve never met my wife had I not found her there, and while there are issues (creeps, prostitutes, etc.), that's something you can run into in real life, and you can filter out those people pretty quickly.   
For people I’ve talked to who aren’t getting matches, they either tend to live in an area with not enough density/haven’t set their search parameters wide enough, have terrible pictures, or more commonly, they’re abusing the algorithm and getting downgraded in results (i.e., swiping right on everyone). Or..they just suck at talking to people?  
Either way, it seems that people’s issues or frustrations with dating tend to get magnified digitally, but is it really an app’s fault if you don’t have a good picture or you can’t talk to women? Either way, I think they get way too much hate and are a safe, fun, and efficient way to find what you're looking for.

The thing about playing that kind of role is that by its nature its defined by the context, circumstances, and relationships with the other characters, and is hard to capture again without that same context. 

It feels like they tried to take that same character and overlay it on other projects and they could just never capture the lightning again in the same way, as talented as he is. 

His roles since then have been ambitious, which I respect, but it seems they typecast him thinking that he will bring the Darius magic to every role, which he does to some extent, but they don't realise that a lot of that magic was based on the dynamics of that particular character, and cant just be replicated whenever they want it to.",unpopularopinion

Firstly, people are constrained by time and space, and most people's real-life friends are not necessarily their best choice, but rather a compromise due to not being able to meet more people. Making friends online can break this limitation and broaden your horizons to meet people from all walks of life, helping you understand what kind of people and lifestyles suit you best. 

Secondly, in online socializing, you have absolute choice; if you don't like someone, just block them, but in real life, you can't do that because you may have many intersections in real life, leading to unnecessary social interactions. 

Lastly, many real-life social interactions revolve around trivial matters, essentially exchanging meaningless conversations, but with online friends, you can have many common interests and truly achieve a Platonic form of spiritual exchange.

I haven't seen anyone suggest \*making content\* about a hobby or area of interest, which I have experienced to be a really efficient way to meet people.

If you start a hobby, especially as a man looking to meet women, you're just another schlub with a hobby you're probably not very good at, because you just started.  
When you create content, even if the account is small (a few hundred or thousand subs/ followers), you position yourself as an authority in the hobby or interest, which automatically confers status.

1414,1707546076.0,Playoffs in professional sports defeat the point of the regular season.,"The way I see it, playoffs only allow teams that otherwise wouldn't be anywhere near making it to a championship game, to get way closer than they ever should have. I don't care what sport it is you watch, allowing 10-12 players/teams to make it into the playoffs is BS. It means close to half the teams in a given league have a shot to get in, and makes the entire regular season borderline pointless. 

You can be the best team in the MLB, make the playoffs easily, and get swept in the divisional by a team that couldn't win for shit earlier in the season. In NASCAR, it's even worse. 16 out of the 40 full time drivers make it into the playoffs. That's nearly half the grid. Not to mention racing can sometimes be decided by pure luck. It's bullshit

My solution, simple. For something like NASCAR, use the F1 points system. The best driver at the end of the year is crowned champion.

And for the NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, etc, Use a record based format. The team in each confrence (NFC/AFC, NL/AL) play in the championship game, be it the Super Bowl, or the World Series. If you want to crown a deserving champion, this is how.

1415,1707541967.0,People only care about their friends dating their exes or their partners talking to exes because they themselves have never gotten over an ex,"Just saw a post where everyone was saying that it's asshole-ish behavior for a friend to get together with your ex. I can see where that would be friendship-ending if your friend knows your ex was abusive or if your relationship ended on bad terms, because you would expect your friend to have empathized with your plight and written your ex off as a bad person. But you can't feel betrayed without some deep emotions and expectations. So I don't understand why someone would feel betrayed about a friend dating an ex if they didn't have unresolved feelings about that relationship. 

I also don't understand why people have such a big problem with their partners having exes as friends. There can be specific suspicious people in your partner's life, but if you think talking to an ex at all is unacceptable I think it says a lot more about how you might react to and feel about an ex than it does about your partner's loyalty. But even if you did assume that someone might feel some type of way about their ex, why would the solution be to ban them from interacting instead of just breaking up with your partner? If someone would be willing to cheat on you or leave you because of their ex, they clearly didn't see the commitment as a commitment. Is someone who isn't responsible, considerate, and trustworthy enough not to cheat on you/leave you for an ex really someone you want to be legally, financially, and socially tied to? 

Anyway, I feel like the only explanation for people feeling uncomfortable or betrayed by a friend dating an ex or a partner talking with an ex is that they're secretly still in love with their ex and would jump for the chance to get back together with them.",unpopularopinion

You’re just entitled to a workers labor in exchange for the pay you provide. They will not share your full vision or provide the same level of commitment that you obviously have. 

At least here in the US, it seems like often folks act like attempting to start/run a business is some noble cause that deserves immense respect and admiration. It IS a challenging feat, and I respect folks who put in the hard work towards it but the core of it is still an attempt to make money.

This particularly irks me when folks will talk about workers wages or rights etc  and someone will interject essentially “THINK OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES!” as if workers should be proud to just be part of it.

Likewise, if your business can’t afford to keep up with the trend in wages OR if you genuinely need to utilize teenagers as a primary source of labor then maybe its just not meant to be.

1418,1707538287.0,Car culture and suburban/rural living trumps the urban lifestyle,"Let me lay down why I'm all about cars over public transportation and city life.

  
First off, freedom. Picture yourself cruising down the highway, wind in your hair, no restrictions. That's the kind of freedom you just can't get on a packed bus or train.

  
Convenience is a biggie too. No waiting around for the next bus or train – with a car, you're the boss of your own schedule. Need to make a quick stop? Just hop in your car and go, no waiting necessary.  
Privacy is another deal-breaker for me. With a car, you've got your own space to do your thing without prying eyes or unwanted company.

  
Safety is key. I feel way safer driving in my own car, especially in dodgy areas or late at night. Plus, I can choose the safest route and avoid any potential trouble spots.

  
Time is precious, right? With a car, you're not stuck waiting for multiple transfers or dealing with unexpected delays. You're in control of your own time, plain and simple.

  
Independence is everything. No more relying on public transportation schedules or begging for rides – with a car, you're calling the shots.

  
Now, about those giant highway systems. Some people might see them as eyesores, but not me. I see endless possibilities. Giant highways mean endless adventures, from coast-to-coast road trips to exploring new cities.

  
Sure, cars have their downsides – traffic, maintenance costs, environmental concerns – but for me, the freedom, convenience, and independence they offer make it all worth it. So yeah, call me old-fashioned, but I'll take four wheels and a full tank of gas over crowded buses and city streets any day.",unpopularopinion

1427,1707507571.0,Being great at an instrument =/= being a great artist or musician,"I think that technical skill is far less important than WHAT you're expressing, and how genuine it is.

Some of the most beloved producers and artists aren't that great in terms of dexterity and technical skill. Look at someone like Kurt cobain, Smells like teen spirit is just 4 basic power chords. Something most beginners can pull off.

People accuse Jimi hendrix of being sloppy, or that Anthony Kiedis cant sing worth shit, but I dont think any of that matters. What matters is that it sounds good. Kiedis in specific is open about the fact he never even took singing lessons until Californication, LOL... After 15 years or so in the band. But who cares? The music sounds good. We listen for the sound, not the technical ability, and those 2 arent always the same.

Nobody besides people who are super into the technical side give a damn about who has the best pitch control when singing, or who can play the best guitar in terms of dexterity, or any technical skill for that matter. All that matters is if it sounds good... If i fiddle around on a piano without knowing any keys or any music theory, and find something that sounds cool, then thats all that matters.

Lots of older rock bands didnt have much of an idea what they were doing, theyd just fiddle around until they found something that worked. Music theory people try and reverse engineer it and figure out WHY it worked, or why it sounded good, but the person making the music rarely even thinks of it.

I liken it to a book, WHAT youre writing about is far more important than your ability to articulate, grammar, etc. Fact is, alot of the beloved icons can just translate a specific feeling into a sound, and own it very well. Plus, like a proof reader, we have things like pitch correction, and many other audio tools to correct imperfections. All that matters is if the end product sounds good, not what the artist's technical abilities are.

Another example is Eminem. Technical skill-wise, he's better than hes ever been... Wordplay, honed in flows, and just overall ability, he is phenomenal. But fans yearn for his older work, Eminem show, MMLP, SSLP, etc. because it sounded better. It was more interesting, better topics, and just had a better sound, despite his technical skill being worse. I don't think technical ability matters nearly as much as just the simple question - does it sound good?",unpopularopinion
1428,1707506143.0,It’s really asinine how normalized it is for 16-18 year olds to basically decide the rest of their life at that age,"I feel like nobody really talks about how crazy the high school to college pipeline is. Like yes education is important and going to college has many advantages in regards to career, finances, and success. But the way college is today and how expensive life necessities are like housing and cars it’s not the path for everyone. 

First you have a lot of kids in high school who have no idea what they want in life but everyone just pressures them into college and all their friends are doing it and that’s the only thing they know to be successful. But if you choose a bad major or you’re not eligible for a lot of aid or scholarships it will make your life a lot harder. This is pretty obvious to a lot of redditors so I won’t go into it.

Music is in stores and shops. People play loud music in their cars. Or you are a passenger and the driver is playing music you would never ever listen to. You can’t close your ears so you’re trapped listening to awful or deafeningly awful music until you’re done with watching the video, shopping at the store, passing by that car, or making the driver turn it off. I was staying with a friend and she played her music really loud all day while doing some cleaning. Too bad I don’t have a remote where I can turn off the music people are playing.

Impossible to go anywhere in civilization without hearing music. I can’t avoid everyone and stay indoors with beautiful silence or music I enjoy. I can’t live in the forest and off the grid either. Way too much music is being played without regard to my permission, personal taste, and preferences. Before electronics were invented, people had to play live music to hear any. You could actively avoid hearing music by not going to a concert. Or go if you wish. People just sat inside their houses in silence or had a conversation. How exquisite for them.

Now, most people use a sound bar which really amplifies the action and makes them feel like the action is too loud, or people just use the b built in speaker on their flat screens which is also bad but not in the same way.",unpopularopinion

1460,1707431206.0,Most of the youth today are completely obsessed with looks and/or ageing,"Something I've noticed explode over the last few years is publicly shared criticism and opinions over people's appearances on social media. It seems like an obsession - You see this on any form of social media with the ability to comment. These types of comments are always highly reacted to so many people agree with them. 

Being that it has come on over the last few years, I assume it's younger people who weren't online before.

Don't get me wrong - if someone is X age and looks slightly older, or maybe has thin hair, or a receded hairline, yeah I do notice. Everyone does I assume to an extent. 

You'll go on a well made video on a topic unrelated to the presenter's appearance, and yeah maybe they aren't a model - you can guarantee there is someone in the comments ripping into their appearance, usually with hundreds of likes and replies, all laughing at the expense of some innocent person. That is something I would never consider doing - especially for things out of a person's control.

It's not even always negative opinions. I mean this isnt an issue obviously, but even with good looking people, people are fixated on their appearance traits too. 

I've been on social platforms for over 15 years at this point, and I've just noticed this trend grow over the past 5 years. 

I don't see this mentioned anywhere else so I assume it's not a ""popular"" opinion. 

My own take is that making fun of people for their looks, especially traits that are genetically inherited is stupid. I'm sure that some would spend thousands on whatever treatments to fix their flaws, but in my view that can encourage the mental flaw of being insecure.

1470,1707417490.0,Retro Video Games Should Be Valued Higher,"Let me paint a picture:

You bought a game 20 years ago. You took good care of that game. It's been in your home, which has not been flooded, on fire, or through some other extreme event which would damage the game. You spent money in utility bills to help keep that game in a climate-controlled environment. You carefully took it out and put it back into it's case each time you played it, and there are no scratches or scuffs on the cartridge or disc. You finally decide, ""Alright, I need some extra cash, let's sell that game."" You look on eBay, and it recently sold for $20.

All of that time, energy, money, and dedication to preserving a piece of history for $20. (This is me and my 23 year old, pristine copy of THPS for Dreamcast.)

Quality old game kept in good condition should be valued just as much as new games, if not more, if it's absolutely mint. There's a limited supply of these games and every day that supply gets smaller. I understand the relationship between supply and demand, and the demand is half of the equation, but rarity also plays a part of it, and the rarity of a retro game in great shape is pretty high.

In those decades, conservatives would edit out violence, cultures, sex, drugs, and moral issues in tv shows and movies as a way to make sure that these shows were safe for the audience. In reality, it made them worse because audiences knew what was going on in these show and didn’t find the censored versions enjoyable and went to piracy and gatekeeping in order to search for the uncensored versions. People who saw the uncensored versions of these tv shows and movies then took action to rise up against the censorship of their favorite shows and movies and demanded the ones in charge to stop their conservative way or face the consequences. One example would be the Children’s Television act of 1993, which was made by Peggy Charen and she made sure that all tv shows and movies be censored for broadcast tv for the masses and that cause the rise of cable tv as a way to get away from the censorship.

I am not comparing it to any Pixar films like Inside Out, Coco, elemental, etc.

Also this is not me saying these movies are bad in any way, they are still very enjoyable and i still watch them! I just think PATF is the best one! 

Original post:

As the title says, I believe that Princess and the Frog was the last great Disney animated movie. And no, it's not just because it was the last 2d animated one (though that definitely influences my personal ranking of it). I just don't think Disney has reached the heights of PATF since. The music is one of the biggest reasons for this; the songs in that movie are so full of love and really represent the setting, and the singers they got portray the characters and stories they're trying to tell so well. The story, although just an adaptation of another fairy tale, really speaks to me. The way they changed Tiana's character from a spoilt princess to a hard-working woman trying to open her own business \*Chefs Kiss\*. She's also the last Disney princess who has a somewhat unique personality. Most that followed have the ""adorkable"" personality, and I'm tired of it now. Finally, the visuals are just so lively and beautiful! Anyway all that said, Princess and the Frog is amazing and nothing else has topped it since.

Some honourable mentions for movies that almost reached the heights of PATF:

* Moana - I enjoyed the songs that represented Polynesian music, and Moana herself was at least less ""adorkable"" than the others, but the story was a little empty, and the ""villain"" (if you can even call it that) was just part of the twist villain trend in Disney so I felt a little disappointed.
* Tangled - The story was good but Rapunzel was the beginning of the ""adorkable"" trend, so looking back at her now she just melts in with the rest of them. Music was great though, very theatre-esque, if not a little pop-musicy in some songs. Also, the world just felt a little lifeless, which is probably due to the fact that it was 3d animated, and they still weren't really used to that yet as they had only done about 4 3d animated movies beforehand, and they all looked a little.... off.",unpopularopinion

I know everybody has a different measure of success, but compared to the “weird” kids or “loners,” they are thriving. I remember we always heard that the popular kids will grow up to be fat and make minimum wage for the rest of their lives while their “unpopular” classmates will be their boss and hugely successful.

Most of the “weird” kids from my high school years are the ones who are working minimum wage or not working at all. A lot of them got fat over the years. Others continue to be immature and start Facebook drama on our hometown page (really? We aren’t in high school anymore, grow up). I know another who has a different baby daddy with each of her kids- no judgment, but it’s a sign that she didn’t make a lot of smart decisions (one night stands, friends with benefits, etc)

The popular ones who were involved with extracurricular activities look like they are living fulfilling lives. Financially stable (not necessarily wealthy, but smart with their finances and living comfortably), healthy, and happy. Most of them aren’t doctors or lawyers, but they look to have solid careers.

Of course there are exceptions, I know of one nerdy/smart girl who has some high ranking position at Microsoft and on the other end, I know of a jock/basketball player who was super popular and ended up gaining so much weight I didn’t recognize him when we ran into each other.

Fighting in hockey is sanctioned violence and takes away from the beauty of the game.

And most people tend to think that this will hurt gaming in general. I've even seen a few comments and tweets saying Xbox is going bankrupt. This is not true. There's a reason why Xbox's net worth is over 150 billion while Playstation's and Nintendo's net worth combined don't even equal 100 billion.

There is a reason why Microsoft has one of the biggest net worths for any business in the world. Microsoft knows what it's doing. Microsoft have some of the best executives, financial advisors, and business minds in the world. Microsoft would only be doing this if it means that Microsoft is going to make more money. And when PlayStation and Nintendo figure this out PlayStation and Nintendo will follow suit soon after and start making some of it's exclusive games available on other platforms. PlayStation and Nintendo are also going to do this, because Playstation and Nintendo want to make more money. 

Also Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo barely make any money from selling consoles. Actually there was a report in 2021 where a Microsoft executive has admitted that the company doesn’t earn any profit on sales of Xbox consoles alone. That's because the profit margin for consoles is so thin...almost non existent. Microsoft makes there money through many different ways. However on the Xbox type of income it comes from gamepass and games...not the consoles. 

Microsoft is setting the new trend for gaming and is looking at the future of gaming which is game sales, game services, and streaming games. 20 years from now powerful consoles aren't even going to exist. Games will be streamed through devices like the Fire Stick, Roku, Google Chromecast, TVs, and PCs. The companies will probably come out with their own streaming devices also.",unpopularopinion

It seems like the moment they start branching out into live recordings, fan events, or video streams (especially ones with fan participation), they begin turning into ego-projects and quality goes down. Too much reliance on fan-service, inside jokes, or descent into caricature. Either way. quality suffers.

Another factor trigger for this happens with shows that consist of host(s) that research and discuss a different topic as the focus of each episode. Lots of these hosts are really good researchers and do good work communicating this info. But, there seems to come a point where they (and their audience) start to mistake their ability to research for expertise (or just general ""wisdom""). Enter the ego issues.

To a large extent this is a result of fans elevating the hosts to a level that they aren't prepared to handle. You don't know these people, no matter how much they share with the audience. The various ""scandals"" from the past couple of years with uber-popular personalities should have taught fans to not obsess, but it keeps happening.

However, as a society we appear to have decided that evolution will stop so we can preserve things at some arbitrary point of our choosing.  It truly takes a mammoth level of arrogance, self-importance, or hubris to make this decision.  

For instance, the U.S. federal government has decided to hire shooters to kill Eastern Barred Owls in the Pacific Northwest.

The Eastern Barred Owls are expanding their range into the area. They have a more flexible diet and reproduce more vigorously than the area's native Northern Spotted Owls.  In a perfect example of natural selection in action, the barred owls are beginning to replace the less-vigorous spotted owls.  

I suggest that it's not our role to begin deciding winners and losers in nature.

Full Metal Jacket has a strong opening section, at boot camp with the Gomer Pyle character. As soon as this part of the movie is over, it goes off the rails. I don't find Matthew Modine's character very compelling and I hate his nasally vocal fry voice. I certainly enjoy him in other films, like And the Band Played On, or Pacific Heights, but he's super out of his depth here.

The movie doesn't really have the visually striking qualities I normally associate with Kubrick's films either. On top of that, it's meandering and feels aimless. A bottom tier Kubrick movie is still watchable, but I think this is his worst (excluding Fear and Desire.)",unpopularopinion

In actuality, “football” is really just the broad classification of a type of game.  Of the most popular variations, you can go from kicking the most and handling least—as in association football (soccer)—to kicking least and handling most—as in American (US) football.

But there are other kinds of “football”: Canadian Football, Rugby Union, Rugby League, Gaelic Football, Australian Rules Football, and International Rules Football (which is a hybrid of Gaelic and Australian football and is played very rarely.)

And that’s not to mention all the historic variations within all these “footballs.”  Or the shades of difference between, say, NRL and Super League.  Or basketball and all types of hockey that have their basis in “football.”  Or outliers like Calcio Storico. Or Hurling.

1543,1707031394.0,The fnaf movie only had one flaw,"The fnaf movie is a great movie stand alone. Many people thought it was bad because it didn't live up to expectations, but what could have fixed that? 
I always hear people say how bad it was but they never give a definitive area of flaw or say anything that would make it better. 

There wasn't much wrong with the movie at all, some of the animatronics looked a bit clunky at times but the only real problem was that the villain (William / purple guy) had no real screen time. In any good movie the villain always has a good motivation for being the bad guy and they need actual time to BE the bad guy. 

Basically the movie had neither of those. William had all of 5 minutes of screen time before he died. The villain also needs to be in the movie as much as the main character because without them there isn't much of a story.
Also they need proper motivation for wanting to be the bad guy. I follow fnaf lore decently closely and even knowing all of that the motives in the movie were really unclear, like why did he kidnap Mike Schmidt's brother? Just for the funny? Then there's the whole kids in the suits, but that makes sense from the game lore standpoint, but what about the people who don't know the lore, their probably ao confused thinking this movie's constantly pulling stuff out its ass.

If they could just make the villain have more screen time making him do bad things to make him seem more like an actual threat, it would even make the ending of the movie feel more climactic than it was. In the end it felt way too fast and really rushed. 

Bottom line, they need to make a better villain.

Apart from being vague (I've seen ""Mature"" be interpreted as ""my kids in 5th grade, he's mature"") it also doesn't technically restrict you. A 12 year old can buy an M rated game if he can talk the employee into it, and it won't break laws as far as I know except corporate laws.

Movie theaters require ID for R rated movies. Children under 6 aren't allowed at all. This is standard at every movie theater chain. Movies aren't interactive, they're static. You only *watch* the psycho murderer. Video games are inherently worse, as you *are* the psycho murderer. 

My opinion is that the ESRB should be replaced with age numbers on a game by game basis (5+, 12+, 14+, 18+, 21+, etc) based on the games content instead of lumping it into categories, so anyone who buys it knows *exactly* what they're getting. Buying any game of 18+ rating should require ID, and it should be an actual crime to distribute these games in stores without ID. 

I don't think these games should be banned totally (even if I think games like Postal don't need to exist) because they're a part of free speech and expression, but if you need an ID to see R movies, you should need an ID to buy R games. What you do with them is your business, but at very least, it should be made *very* clear what the game is. ""Mature"" doesn't say the same thing as ""18+"" and legally mandated ID requirement does.

The whole GameStop thing was talked about as if it was the working class VS the evil bankers who shut us out and take money from our pockets. People acted like, and continue to act like, buying GameStop stock was somehow showing it to the big guy. It was the little guy fighting back. In the movie the bankers are shown to be very wealthy and their wealth is treated as a sign of how evil they are. 

Here’s my issue with that: you people that bought the GameStop stock didn’t give a shit about class structures or wealth inequality. You didn’t want to redistribute wealth. In the Dumb Money movie what do they do with the money? Open an Orphanage? No they buy sports cars. You people worship these symbols of wealth just as much as anyone else, and the only reason you hate bankers is because you are jealous and want their success.

If the people who took part in the pump and dump GameStop scheme wanted to make money, fine whatever. But don’t act like you were taking an ideological stance. They aren’t revolutionaries. They aren’t Robin Hood.

And also, the investing is not us vs investment bankers. Have you ever wondered where the money the investment bankers invest comes from? Pensions, 401ks, IRAs.

Aiming a gun at this best friend’s back, simply because he wants what his friend had. He assaults Lori at the CDC, kills Otis in cold blood.

I see a lot of “walkers only go after live bait” stuff online as justification. Lets say Shane had to shoot Otis, ok, fine. But he could’ve shot him in the head and left him for dead. Proof? The walkers ate Nicholas even after he shot himself in the head.

Shane is mentally weak. He got so attached to Lori that quickly that he would aim a gun at his best friend to take her back from him.

A lot of things he said, or wanted to do made sense. Walkers in the barn, Randal, etc etc. but Shane didn’t do this for the safety of the group, he simply wanted Lori and Carl for himself, he didn’t give a damn if anyone else got hurt, unlike Rick.

“Sophias dead sophias dead, stop looking for her blah blah” and yet when she actually IS revealed to be dead, who shoots her? RICK FUCKIN GRIMES DOES. Shane wasn’t mentlaly prepared to take that shot, he isn’t about that life.

So, in the new Suicide Squad game, Batman gets shot in the head by Harley Quinn. This is the Arkham Batman portrayed by Kevin Conroy. The same Batman that we spent multiple games playing as. The invincible, body smashing, ass whooping, unstoppable force that practically cleaned out an entire literal city worth of people. Just handling business. Well he got caught, tied up, and shot in the head by Harley Quinn. 

Everyone is so pissed that he was disrespected that way. It was so anti climactic. How could Batman die with a bullet to the head? With all that he’s been through, a fucking bullet to the head. 

But that’s the beauty of it. It kind of reminds you of his humanity. Throughout the Arkham Series, the character becomes larger than life. You’re invincible. You become a literal super hero, impossible to keep up with, always prepared for anything, just an unstoppable force as you barrel through impossible odds. We do so much that we forget that Batman is not in fact Wonderwoman or Superman. He’s a regular human being. Just as normal as you and me. That shot to the head reminds the audience that this human being was able to accomplish so much. Everything we did was by a person. It adds a little bit of awe to the character.

 It’s like seeing a world class boxer win a title only to find out that he beat cancer 5 years earlier. He becomes an inspiration. All the sudden, you want to try more. Batman could do it, why couldn’t you? He’s pushed the envelope and shown us how far the human condition is truly capable of. If Superman died, there’s a disconnect there. He’s an alien.

Each time, they come with with a strike, Miyagi counters, and then they’re all stunned, letting Miyagi finish them off. Even Kreese’s mini fight with Miyagi in KK3 was an embarrassment.

In the first 45 minutes of the show, six contestants play a variety of games that are entertaining to watch and what really makes it great is that you can play along with the contestants. 

  
The showcase showdown, nothing happens. They just show a bunch of prizes, and then the contestants have to guess a price. I mean I get it -- basically the entire show is contestants just guessing prices but it's done in a more entertaining fashion. There is zero entertainment value to the showcase showdown where the contestant just stands at a podium and says a number. But this is the show's GRAND finale and what the whole thing leads up to. It's a pretty disappointing finish. 

The showcase showdown is basically the equivalent of what contestants are doing to earn their way on stage, just with significantly more valuable prizes. To earn your way on stage, the show is basically acknowledging ""this is not entertaining, we'll make this go real fast, and then the real fun begins when the contestant gets on stage."" 

Then they do the showcase showdown and they're like… ""yea you know that really boring aspect of the show that we run through in 5 seconds throughout the whole show? We're going to turn that into our grand finale."" It makes no sense. 

Rather than having two showcases, they should just have one, and the two finalists need to participate in some sort of pricing game against one another for a chance to win the big grand prize. Maybe the person who guesses the most correct prices of grocery items in a certain time span, gets the grand prize. But two people just standing there and clapping while a bunch of prizes are announced is really boring. 

It's crazy after all this time, no change has been made to the showcase showdown portion of the show. ",unpopularopinion

On the contrast, I feel like all of the seasons were relatively the same, with seasons 6-9 being my least favorite due to a personality change in homer that I noticed (He was significantly meaner and more dense than in earlier and later seasons.).

However I do feel like the seasons 32, 33 and 34 stood out the most as the most enjoyable due to them including both random nonsense episodes like they did in the OG first 6 seasons that people liked, as well as included major character building episodes for a lot of the regular same old same old characters.

Some people even post a picture of the unopened box like ""fast shipping great packaging, 5 stars!"" I get that it's exciting to get a shiny new thing in the mail, but with so many minimum-viable-products out there it really does a disservice to other consumers to only post reviews when the item is brand new. I would trust Amazon (and other retailers) a lot more if I knew that reviews were only posted by people who had used the item for some time after the initial excitement wore off. Rating things well immediately just inflates the ratings and makes them meaningless.

edit: obviously for consumables there could be an exception, but really I don't care as much about reviews for cookies or toothpaste as I do for tools and appliances. I think the waiting period would hurt reviews for consumables far less than it would help reviews of durable goods. Amazon could easily send an automatic email after a month to remind people to review the item. Even if fewer people post reviews it would still be an improvement. The unhelpful reviews made by people excited about their new thing are the problem.

That's the not the situation I'm addressing with my take on this. I chose a month because that's typically the return window.

1589,1706786036.0,"You don't need to play a game X hours, to say you don't like it.","There seem to be a lot of people, that try to invalidate a negative opinion about games they like by saying: ""You didn't play it long enough, so you can't judge."" I think this is complete nonsense. Probably every gamer has already looked at a game trailer and thought: ""I don't like this."" You don't need to play X hours to know if you like a game or not. Sometimes just hearing about the setting and genre can be enough to judge. Sometimes gameplay trailers can be enough. Sometimes an hour of trying the game can be enough. Sometimes it takes 10+ hours to make up a mind about a game. But it's up to the player to decide, when he's seen enough, to form an opinion about a game. And it's stupid to try and invalidate others subjective opinion, because they did something, you yourself do all the time, too.

Why should anyone keep playing a game past the point, where it isn't fun anymore? Even if maybe the game could become fun at a later point, why should I play the unfun part to get to the point, when I just as well can play another game, that's fun from start to finish? 

If I boot a game up and in the first 10 seconds I notice, that the font is for ants and I don't want to sit right in front of the TV, while playing this game, just to be able to read anything, than it's valid for me to dislike the game even if I only played 10 seconds.

It's all about subjective opinions and preferences. Everybody is an expert on his own preferences, while others are not. So who am I to question, if somebody tells me he did or didn't like game X?

This argument is just an instrument to dismiss an opinion people don't like. I've read the following conversation in another post, that I write in a simplified way. 

Person A: ""I don't like this game""

Person B: ""You probably didn't play it enough""

Person A: ""Ive actually beat it""

Person B: ""Well if you've beaten it, you must have enjoyed it, or else you wouldn't have played so long.""

This boils down to:

Short playtime = invalid opinion

Long playtime = you enjoyed the game

So apparently the only valid opinion is, that Player A enjoyed the game. And even if you say: ""Ok, but it's a difference between playing a game for 10 hours or beating it."" Yes of course it is, but the logic behind those arguments is so arbitrary, that you can just apply one of the arguments to any given playtime. It's just a tool to confirm a bias for some people. Because apparently they like the game so much, that it transcends them. They like it so much, that everybody in the world has to like the game to. That's why they need to invalidate negative opinions about the game, even though they are opinions completely subjective to the person. 

The same thing also exists in the opposite direction, where people hate a game so much, that it transcends them and everyone needs to hate the game. But that's another topic. 

Long story short. People are free to form their opinions about games however they want. It's their subjective opinion, so they set the rules. No matter how much they played a game and if they liked or disliked it, all the opinions about a game are equally valid. So please stop this ""YoU DidN'T pLAy LoNg EnOuGh!""

1604,1706748021.0,The sport of baseball has no GOAT,"Yep. You heard it. Baseball doesn't have a GOAT in my opinion. Let me explain. 

Baseball was invented in 1839. Because of this, the sport has changed a lot over the years. Every single era is different because of the way MLB players have been developed over the years.

Back in the early 1910s, there was a player by the name of Ty Cobb. He definitely would not have been able to survive the live-ball era. And this is someone who won 12 batting titles. 

Then, there was Babe Ruth. Babe Ruth dominated the 1920s and early 1930s. Most people would call him the GOAT of baseball. However, a lot of people say that he would not have survived in today's MLB.

Then, there was Ted Williams. The best player in the 1940s and 1950s. Many people would argue that he was the GOAT of baseball. However, the MLB was still not to where it is today, and I'm not sure if Ted would have been able to adapt to how the pitchers can manipulate their pitches.

Then there was Pete Rose. The best player of the 1960s and 1970s, and the hits king. Baseball was beginning to become a lot more like it is today, however, he bet on baseball and slept with a minor. I am not sure that many people would be ok with someone like that being their sport's GOAT.

Today, there is Albert Pujols. He hit 3,000 balls for base hits and over 700 home runs. Should he be the GOAT? Some people think that his lack of advanced stats could be a strike against him.

Because of this, I think that the ""GOAT of Baseball"" does not exist. Or at least is a debate that is harder to have.

Maybe they don’t use their turn signals all the time, but they indicate their intentions with the car’s “body language”. It doesn’t mean they don’t do jerk things,  but you can tell easily what jerk thing they are about to do so at least it isn’t dangerous.

As for “Halloween”, Jamie Lee did a good job in her role but the earlier scenes where Michael’s following her around IN BROAD DAYLIGHT took away the spookiness and made him just seem silly.

Gee, I wonder why people are feeling so isolated and lonely these days?

Especially from guys, there’s this common refrain of “not wanting to be seen as a creep” which compounds the “anxiety about approaching someone” thats existed long before modern dating habits. That line itself is a big red flag to me, because generally speaking, humans aren’t bothered by the mere idea of a stranger speaking to them. But a stranger showering them with compliments then asking them out? Well, thats another thing.

So many people seem to miss the distinction between “approaching/hitting on someone” where your introductory conversation is you feeling attraction, making a pass, hoping the other party reciprocates instead of establishing mutual attraction first. If you ask a barista out because you felt a connection when she did her job duties by being kind to you, that’s unlikely to work. But if you think you feel a little connection, go back to the shop and notice that the cute barista takes an extra minute to chat with you, does something “special” for you, then you’ve got a chance!

Then people text you and that’s a little easier to manage. But let’s not forget about Facebook HBD wishes posted to your timeline from people you haven’t talked to in 29 years and now you have to figure out how to say thank you to 65,432,765 Facebook friends. It’s exhausting. 
 
I’m not the girl that celebrates my bday all month or week. That’s too much pressure. When it’s your bday people want you to pick the place to eat and uggghhhh too many decisions. It’s exhausting. 

People ask you what you want for you bday. Nothing. I’m an adult I’ll buy my own gifts. Or if they gift you something you have to act like you like it even though you have no use for a velvet mushroom painting that made your grandma think of you because of that one time you shoved a mushroom up your brothers nose.

1655,1706607105.0,The current situationship trend is stupid,"Is it dating someone casually, friends with benefits or unrequited love? I have no idea why the western world keeps adding so many unnecessary stages of being in a relationship with someone. I see so many people these days complaining about failed situationships as if they broke up with their life long partner. I find it very silly that you would be so upset over someone who never wanted to make you two official.

To me it just feels like using people like some kind of tool, like how you use a toothbrush to brush your teeth to look/feel better until you need to replace it. 

It feels kind of greedy to want everything a relationship can offer, but without the actual commitment. And the worst part is people don't realise that it's not as innocent as it may seem, a lot of them are genuinely being used and mistreated and it hurts to see most of the time. I think a lot of these situationships are the result of one partner never saying what they actually want out of this. If you want something casual both of you should agree to it, without pressure of course.

I just wish all these young people had more self respect, because it hurts seeing them suffer from all these unfair relationship dynamics.


Edit: I didn't expect this post to blow up so much so I wanted to add a little more. I'm sorry if my post comes off harsh, I was simply venting a little bit, because I keep seeing people talk about situationships these days, most of which sound a bit unpleasant to be in. I do believe that a casual relationship like this can work out if both people are consenting to it. My problem comes from situations where one person wants something more, while the other doesn't - this is why I said it seems a little greedy to me. Greedy because sometimes people who want something casual usually take advantage of more insecure people who might not speak up for themselves and just accept whatever mistreatment comes their way, while still feeling obligated to act like they are fully committed. So, obviously, healthy situationships are excluded from this and I am mostly ranting about the problematic ones that pop up online. I hope I was able to explain myself better this time around since my original thoughts seem a bit messy now that I re-read them 😅",unpopularopinion

The fact that they have full episodes of “let’s talk about how player x’s emotions are”, or this player’s social media posts make me feel this way or that way, or personal opinions of talk show hosts. Or what they do in their quiet time. They are even getting down to players personal private lives and their families.

It’s not 100% bad but most of it is. Sports networks are grasping for content, they burned out anything remotely interesting in the sport itself. If you watch sports talk shows then it is no different than watching the kardashian’s, so if you watch the talks shows don’t bash those celebrity shows because you contribute to the same formula. These sports networks are dramatizing random every day life of people, they are becoming another MTV, which I understand the need for the content shift. 

I know I’m in the minority on this idea but they can talk about stats, numbers, history and future. Emphasize more on achievements, personal or macro level. They can talk about how teams or leagues or even individual players are giving back to their community or schools. Positive things happening because of the sport. They can talk about initiatives, what can be better, what can be done to improve the sport, improve the education of kids, improve community involvement and after school programs.

My solution would be make it illegal to advertise fast foods and the price should be dramatically increased to make it unworthwhile for people to eat such food on a regular basis, while the government should also make a signifcant effort to make the healthy foods more affordable for the average people. There should also be money invested into educating people more on what a healthy diet looks like and basic everyday recipes which they can use.

If you watch a reel now, you may not be able to talk to me about it tomorrow, but if you see the same reel months later, you'll know you already saw it.

The issue is, your brain has limited power. The power it spends to do all of this isn't spent doing more important things like thinking of solutions to issues, processing emotions and other quite important stuff, leading to people being less able to handle their issues.

This isn't saying technology usage is always bad, but it's wrong to consider it relaxing.

1682,1706521149.0,Many legal services are a complete waste of money,"**Disclaimer:** I am writing this in Australia, from an Australian perspective. If you are in the US or UK things may differ.

This is coming from someone who has completed a law degree at a top 50 global university with very high marks. On graduation, I was placed in the top 5% of the graduating class, which is most likely better than most lawyers you have met or dealt with. I also have worked at an elite global law firm. I say this because it helps me establish credibility, in a world where everyone seems to hate on lawyers for no reasons or for completely the wrong reasons. 

My unpopular opinion is that many legal services are a complete waste of money. 

Most people think that law is a complex discipline, involving lots of reading, dissecting complex legal judgments and understanding intricate theories formulated decades ago by judges and academics. Law school may be like that to an extent, but legal practice is essentially administrative work. In most commercial areas, you are essentially filling out paperwork.

You will either be a ""transactional"" lawyer or a ""litigation"" lawyer. Either way, your job will involve classifying documents, completing documents, conducting due diligence and drafting documents based on pre-existing template. 

These are not complex tasks. It is simply administrative work at the end of the day. The system, whether intentionally or not, makes it difficult for laymen to navigate.

The simple sale of a property or a criminal law matter is made so much more daunting and complex due to inadequate systems and processes which are clunky and not user-friendly. 

I am not saying that legal services are useless. I think that a lot of the time, they are overpriced. This particularly applies to lawyers and law firms that charge by six minute increments (a very common practice here in Australia). A lot of top law firms will employ graduates and associates to do work that a law clerk could do, which is billed at a higher rate. Even a senior associate sometimes will charge upwards of $500 an hour - a complete waste of money if you ask me.

Simpsons is amazing and a cultural phenomenon but it's not the same as it was in its prime, barely anyone even talks about it anymore, and yet it can't be laid to rest in peace. 
   South Park was originally off to a rocky start because studios didn't think an animated show that doesn't feature a family sitcom would have success. 
 This is honestly a tragedy to imagination and original ideas when these adult animations are being forced into boxes. 

  People clearly want adult oriented animation, but the field is gagged with this media to the point that some shows aren't even trying anymore, it's like a machine, show after show with the exact same concept but worse. 
 These types of shows should finally get their conclusion and should be laid to rest to allow more variety and ideas to enter the field.

The current trend in smartphone design leans towards rounded corners, which, while aesthetically pleasing to some, doesn't provide the same immersive experience that a square-cornered, rectangular phone does. 

The square shape, with its sharp corners, gives the impression of looking through a window onto whatever you're viewing on your screen.

 It's a subtle difference, but one that significantly enhances the user experience.

The Galaxy S24 Ultra is a prime example of this design philosophy. 

Its square corners and rectangular shape make it stand out in a sea of rounded-corner phones.

 It's a refreshing change that I believe other mobile phone companies should consider.

In a market saturated with similar-looking devices, a square-cornered, rectangular phone could be a unique selling point.

1719,1706398885.0,Reality tv should not be stigmatized. It’s fun.,"
I do not understand why reality tv gets so much hate. It’s simply entertainment. Participants are hired to entertain an audience. What’s so wrong about that? Every point I’ve heard made has been completely nonsensical.

“Haha, it’s all scripted anyway!”

Most aren’t. Some, like “The Hills” are more scripted than most. But usually, production will give the cast an idea, and the cast runs with it on their own. Even if it WAS scripted, who fucking cares? Doesn’t ruin the entertainment value for me. I am inclined to believe it’s more real than not, because often the participants embarrass themselves, get arrested, get others pregnant. Strongly doubt anyone would go to that extent for a reality tv show storyline, to ruin their own reputations, if it weren’t their real actions. 

“It’s pointless. All these people fight over nothing. They contribute nothing to society.”
Yeah, then so is football, basketball, all sports. A bunch of people fighting over a ball, that has no real impact on society, just entertainment. 

“Reality show participants are a bad influence on younger people. People will see that and think it’s ok to act like that.”

Then so are violent video games, and we know that argument is false. 

“Reality show participants are the scum of society. They have no talent.”

A bunch of sports players have DV charges too, don’t take care of their children, cheat on their wives, list goes on. Most aren’t particularly intelligent either. And reality tv participants do have talent- the talent to entertain, to maintain audience interest. Whether one thinks that’s valuable or not is up to them. 

“People only watch reality tv to feel better about themselves and judge other people.”

And the fatasses watching sports, giving their opinion on every player, every play and referee call, aren’t?

“They’re exploiting personal drama for money!”

And they get paid pretty well. It’s a job like any other.

Reality tv watching a hobby like any other.

If an employee doesn’t want to come into work because they want to take a “self-care day”, that’s seen as perfectly justified even if they’re not using PTO or sick leave. Managers are expected to make exceptions when they have rules to follow and a business to run. Employees who back talk to managers are fully supported and even encouraged. 

If a customer asks an innocent question about “merchandise in the back” or some other question borne more out of a lack of knowledge than malice or entitlement, employees who respond to them in a rude or harsh way are seen as totally justified and even righteous. If a patron doesn’t neatly arrange their dishes for a waiter, then they’re an asshole. 

Businesses have an obligation to pay you a fair market rate for your labor. They don’t have an obligation to pay you for existing. If you’re not meeting standards and being difficult then you deserve to be fired. A manager is not your parent or friend and shouldn’t be expected to act as such. You have a transactional relationship with them. Customers pay you for good service. And yes, that means that in that particular situation you have an unequal relationship. It’s one thing to expect fair pay and safe working conditions. It’s another thing to expect employers to cater to your needs and customers to put up with bad service because you’re having a “bad day”.

Here's why:


As you start going up the Scoville scale, spicy foods get more dangerous. You see cases all the time of people fucking up their stomachs because they ate too much food that was too hot. Don't even get me started with the pain of when the spicy foods have to leave your body.


Now, to someone with not so great spice tolerance, something like a tree pepper to them would feel like a Carolina Reaper to me, which is beneficial, because 1, they don't have to find exotic peppers to feel extreme heat, and 2, they are putting less dangerous food into their bodies. 


Imagine this: a chili with Frank's red hot, except it feels as spicy as a sauce with a habanero base. Wouldn't that be amazing? You get the same feeling of eating a spicy sauce, except you don't have the negative health effects that come with sauces that have significantly more capsaicin, and you won't be dying in the bathroom.

1742,1706317554.0,I believe that having a conscience is actually pretty rare,"When I mean a conscience, I mean an independent ability to judge right or wrong.  And if you're motivated by those judgements.

You might say, well, most people don't steal, murder, rape, etc. But everyone is taught that those things are wrong from birth. They're socially disapproved. There are legal consequences.To determine if people have a conscience, you have to see how they act about an extreme injustice that's socially accepted and legally permitted.

What is an example of that today?

I'd say the #1 example is having other animals tortured and killed for taste pleasure. In most of the Global North, we don't need eat animal flesh or products. Pigs, cows, and chickens feel pain just like us, and are very much like dogs and cats. What is the justification for causing extreme suffering and death? What, someone wants a tasty sandwich for like 10 mins?

Everyone knows about the meat industry. It's 2024. Animals are caged, electrocuted, gassed to death. Even when everyone knows this, they continue to pay for the flesh of those animals. For pleasure. When vegans advocate for animals, people just laugh or say ""found the vegan.""

If having a conscience was common, extreme suffering would elicit way more concern. But that extreme suffering is legal and socially accepted. And people get some minor benefit from it (a few minutes of pleasure). In the absence of consequences, no one cares. For decades, entire lifetimes of eating tortured animals and not caring.

IMO, that's the clearest illustration in today's world that having a conscience is rare.  A lot of what looks like a conscience is just conformity and fear of consequences.

TLDR: I think that having a conscience is actually pretty uncommon. Attitudes and behaviors around animal exploitation (legal and socially accepted) prove it.",unpopularopinion

Searching ""No Damage"" only brought the same results, but it was only when I searched ""Without Taking Damage"" that I finally got what I wanted, an average person pulling it off and it felt genuine, almost cozy.  It's not it wasn't good content, the 3 searches were essentially the same, yet they only gave me the illusion of choice for the first two, they had to curate me garbage instead of letting me choose from a wider selection including that guy.

1752,1706291840.0,Suburbs are better than cities.,"Dont get me wrong, I like cities.

Having lived in dozens places across multiple countries, I have had the opportunity to experience a variety of living experiences.

Some of my best memories are from big cities. The combination of walkability, easy access to food/ entertainment and interesting and talented people is great. Suburbs, by comparison, tend to be pretty boring.

So why are suburbs better? It's simple. The problems in a big city massively outweigh the advantages of living there.

Housing is more expensive, smaller, and often lower quality in cities. Having looked for housing in both a city and its surrounding suburbs, the bar for what is considered a nice place in the city is often much lower than suburb. City landlords have no problem renting out crappy apartments lacking basic amenities, because someone will eventually rent it.

Even if you find good housing in a city, you have to share your space with many more people. City apartment living means sharing walls with a neighbor who might decide to start playing gangster rap at 3AM. Even houses are clustered closer together. In a suburb, you're unlikely to hear anything unless your neighbors are egregiously loud.

Cities mean more access to restaurants and entertainment, but do you really need 50 different Thai restaurants to choose from? Suburbs have access to 90% of what a city has, and for what it doesn't, you can just go to the city.

Cities tend to be higher in crime. They also tend to have less access to nature and higher pollution. Some rare examples like San Francisco have a lot of nature access, but are still weighed down by the other problems on this list.

Sure, needing to drive everywhere isn't ideal. Having the ability to walk places is nice. But aside from that, you can get the best of both worlds by living in a suburb and going to the city when you want or need to.

Simply put, cities are cool, but the tradeoffs aren't worth it. Suburbs provide peace and stability that cities do not with minimal tradeoffs. Hence, suburbs are better.",unpopularopinion

\* Parents/older relatives have health issues or are dying off

\* Hobbies/personal interests are an afterthought if not completely abandoned

1769,1706230912.0,Dating: Follow-up text messages are pointless,"Listen, here's the thing: Follow-up text messages are pointless.

If someone is interested in you, they will reply within a reasonable time. If you've been waiting a day and they haven't texted back, in ***most*** cases they aren't interested.

Too many people get anxious about a lack of a reply and start wondering if the person they're texting is okay or if they're too busy. No -- this is extremely unlikely. If someone is interested in you, they will reply fast and make you a priority in their life.

If my mother or father calls me, I will answer right away unless my phone is off or I am in a serious meeting.

If a friend from 8 years ago calls me, I will probably set aside time to call them back later during the day.

If a telemarketer calls me, I'm not going to reply at all.

And if someone I dated texts me and I'm not interested, I'll probably take a longer time to reply (some people won't reply at all). 

Take the hint. Actions speak louder than words. A person not texting you back is a deliberate action 99.9% of the time. ",unpopularopinion

1776,1706206166.0,VR is Beyond Repair: It's Time to Scrap It and Start Over.,"TL;DR: A vocational rehabilitation center fails to assist people with disabilities effectively, exemplified by Jane Doe's experience. Plagued by bureaucracy, infrequent and unhelpful support, and inappropriate job placements, the center highlights the need for a complete overhaul of the system to truly empower individuals with disabilities. Jane's story becomes a rallying cry for systemic reform. 

Once upon a time in a bustling city, there was a vocational rehabilitation (VR) center that promised new beginnings and thriving careers for those facing employment challenges due to disabilities. Jane Doe, a graphic designer impaired by a recent accident, approached the center with hopes high and spirits lifted. However, the shining beacon of VR turned out to be a flickering candle struggling against the winds of bureaucracy and underfunding.

Jane's initial assessment was promising, but the follow-ups were spaced months apart, each time with a different case worker who seemed more lost in paperwork than the last. The ""custom-tailored"" job placements were square pegs for Jane's round hole of qualifications and aspirations. Each suggested job was a step back from her skills, leaving her feeling undervalued and frustrated.

The final straw came when Jane was offered a position that required physical capabilities that her condition did not permit, a clear sign that her file was just another number, barely reviewed by overworked staff. Jane's story echoed in the halls of the VR center, among many who felt the sting of a system that was supposed to lift them up but instead let them fall through the cracks.

As Jane shared her story with the online world, it became a rallying cry for those who had lost faith in a system riddled with inefficiencies. The consensus was clear: The old VR was beyond repair, and it was time to scrap it and start anew. A system that should empower individuals instead became a testament to the dire need for reform and a fresh start.",unpopularopinion

I’ll always use Ali V Frazier for reference. Fought 3 times, Ali even lost the first one, got knocked down and everything. What makes Ali so great is that he lost multiple times, and still went on. Most of his Ls coming much later in his career, he fought everyone.

Or, rather, meat substitute products will continue to remain novel while the average individual is content to consume real meat; while the average quality and palatability of veggie burgers and tofu and so on have certainly improved over the last two decades, all of these products continue to define themselves against what 'real meat' tastes and feels like. 

This does not have to be the case; these are processed food products, and 'appetizing' does not need to be synonymous with being 'a perfect mimicry of this food'; no person is buying SPAM for it's succulent porky essence, they are buying SPAM because it's a meat product that behaves reliably in specific modes of cooking and like the taste(s). A great deal of mileage could be gained by marketing these products as being genuine innovations in food production, rather than defining themselves against what already exists; these meats should not be limited by defining themselves against the models mother nature has provided our tastebuds, but instead should get weirder and creative for the sake of actually creating a product that can exist by it's own merits, both in terms of a flavor and texture profile but also as something people may consider to 'just be a product' they can enjoy and buy.",unpopularopinion

1814,1706044275.0,"Despite the Piano Man Support, Public Privacy is a Legitimate Issue","First of all, I am not defending the commies.  That would not be an unpopular opinion, but a straight up stupid one.  

But mask in their incredibly stupidity, is the legitimate issue of having privacy in public.  While there's a distinct difference between being a random background NPC, it's quite another to go the other extreme and claim all appearances on public grounds are fair use.

I bring to you the first example of harasser/prank youtubers.  If we agree that there is no limit to what you are allowed to do in public, then where is the outpouring of support for that youtuber that got shot in Virginia?  Because in that case, most people have the decency to know that maybe the delivery man just want to be left along and not participate in someone else's grand illusion.

Example number two, the exploding popularity of police station filming, where the videographer setup to intentionally antagonize the police.  Now, there are going to be more people in support of the filmer in this case because we think the police station should be public grounds and that, let's be honest, lots of people hate the police.

Let's go one step further.  What about Karen or  rage driver video?  I would argue that these people will have the least amount of support, and at the core, we post those video to seek judgment, to mock, or to inflame.  But that's the thing though, we, random strangers on the internet, are not judges.  We do not have legitimacy to film these events in hope of bringing someone down.  

So I say this current environment is a very dangerously delicate line that we are traversing.  It's easy to support the lack of public privacy when the targets are those we reject such as road ragers, Karen, or police.  But it's much harder when it applies to our perceived victims such as our prankees or even... yourself.  

At what point do I have the right to refuse to be judged by the vigilante action?  And that's really what it is.  We perceived justice to be inadequate, too slow, or unfair, so we take it upon ourselves by posting it on the internet.  

Now, I don't deny that there are evil doers in this world.  Surely, they are justified to be exposed and ridicule.  But at what point are we, random bystanders, qualified to judge fairly?  

Case in point, New York bike lady that lost her job because a few teenage hooligans that want to exploit a loophole in renting city bikes.  

So what if the Chinese group had presented their original request in a less asinine way?  Do we all have the right to not be a random protagonist or even... a background NPCs?  I don't pretend to know the answers, but I know this current system cannot be the answer with moving goalposts and arbitrary lines that are too dependent on the flavor of the day.  Public privacy is a real issue, and it's about time that we have a frank discussion about it.",unpopularopinion

1817,1706030331.0,The Oscars are good and cool,"The Academy uses ad revenue from the ceremony to preserve and restore old films, fund young filmmaker initiatives, and run their museum/theater which often shows old movies on film prints. Which all seems like a positive to me.

Also without them there would be very little incentive for studios or distributors to release movies for grownups, as an Oscar nomination can really help with box office for dramas. Because otherwise those types of movies don't make a whole lot of money except for extreme outliers like Oppenheimer.

And while most of the Oscar process is studios campaigning with special screenings with voters (who, for the record, are all directors, actors, writers, editors, set designers, composers, etc - not a board of old people conspiring to not nominate your favorite movie) I do think it is good that sometimes movies that aren't necessarily popular are nominated. Obviously a lot of the box office of today is dominated by CGI stuff, remakes, reboots, sequels, spinoffs, whatever instead of genuinely interesting art. And I think the Oscars are kind of a signal to people who are maybe not always on the pulse of cinema and they can learn about something off their radar. Parasite a few years ago being a great example. And hey maybe this year you should go check out Anatomy of a Fall - rentable for $6 if you're in the US. Good relationship/courtroom drama.

I myself watched the Oscars as a teenager and remember seeing Ennio Morricone win his honorary award, which was presented by Clint Eastwood. That was my first time hearing about The Good the Bad and the Ugly, which I caught on TV not long after and basically kickstarted my love of older movies. Sadly the honorary awards are no longer part of the ceremony, which I think is a missed opportunity to get younger people interested in cinema's history. Who doesn't want to see Sam Jackson or Hayao Miyazaki or Mel Brooks or Angela Bassett get honored for their careers? Would be entertaining imo.

So does Hollywood like to pat itself on the back? Yes. Is that REALLY a bad thing though? I don't know... Hollywood is one of America's biggest exports and seeing people generally underrepresented win major awards, whether its Asian-Americans or the deaf community in the last two years, makes it more acceptable for them to get future movies/shows off the ground that may have not been greenlit otherwise. Seems like another good and cool thing.

The guy is a egotist who only gives his son any positive attention when he successfully tries to emulate him. Otherwise he doesn't help or notice him in any way whatsoever. Time and again he shows in the movie that he's more concerned with his family's reputation than his son's actual well being. 

Worst of all in a pivotal moment in the movie when Little was practically begging his father for emotional support in his hour of need, he just bluntly told his own son in front of the whole town that he doesn't believe him. I mean it would be understandable if he didn't believe him, he just didn't have to do him like that. He could have taken his child aside and told him that they would discuss this later privately but no. Instead he crushed his spirit in just four simple words, in front of thousands of strangers who already thought so low of him. Then the following day instead of comforting his son who's in the throes of depression and self loathing, he actually takes time out of his day to field every single call coming from an unknown number and apologize for the embarrassment his son caused.

Imagine it's been nearly 2 decades since this movie came out and most people have probably already forgotten that Disney even made this movie but I'm still mad. What he did was doubly unsavory given that he is a single father to an only son so they are all they have in this world and he still acts that way. Worst of all, he hits so close to home.

People need to stop associating the ability to remember lots of information (crystallized intelligence) with the ability to work out complex and logical problems on demand (fluid intelligence). Just because someone is able to remember lots of information to get a piece of paper does not mean that they will be able to make difficult and accurate decisions, especially not under pressure.  
  
For example, I'm a 2000 Elo-rated chess player, but I hate the part of the game where you have to memorize opening theory - so I don't. I find it very boring, and I play for the thrill of solving new challenges on demand. I was once in a chess Discord room with around 7 people, and one of them said that they wanted to play a 'strong player'. This is, of course, very subjective, but I thought since I'm in the top 1% of rated players, I'll offer to play them. Before playing me, they started asking me a number of different questions about different opening variations, which I didn't know because I didn't care for memorization. Yes, it's a part of the game, yes, it takes skill, but it's an isolated skill. Since I didn't know these opening theory questions, they were unsure about playing me, asked for my Elo, and didn't believe me when I told them 2000. I assured them I was telling the truth, played them in a game, and completely and utterly wiped the floor with them. Turns out they were a 1500-1600 player that had memorized more opening theory than me; however, I was able to think more critically on demand.  
  
Ultimately, someone who has a good memory does indeed possess a certain type of intelligence and skill, which can be used to obtain high academic achievements, among other things, but it does not guarantee that they are an intelligent person overall.  
  
Yes, I'm aware that some academic courses will require more than just memorization; however, it is mostly just memorization, even in courses such as computer science, which requires programming. You'll find that a lot of students come out of university unable to work in a competitive industry because they can't simply use memorized information to make money for an ever-changing and competitive business.",unpopularopinion

1847,1705852208.0,“Skip the line” passes at theme parks should be expensive,"**TL;DR:** When the fast passes are so expensive that most guests don’t buy them, the experience is better for everyone. Fast pass users wait less (and generally have less restrictions) while regular lines move more consistently.

With less people skipping the line since it’s more expensive, the standard lines move faster as more people from the standard line are able to ride. And if you do pay for a pass, you wait less in the fast pass line. The park may even be able to offer greater access to fast pass users since there are fewer of them.

I frequently go to parks from both Disney and Universal, both with and without the skip the line option, and have noticed a stark contrast between Disney’s and Universal’s line management. 

Genie+ at Disney is much more affordable ($20 to $35 per person per day), and thus, a lot of people actually buy it. Genie+ lines often get backed up and take 20-30 minutes at the popular rides, even though you have to make a reservation on the app for each ride you use Genie+ on. Meanwhile, the standby lines move at a crawl and frequently stop completely for 5-10 minutes just so they can let more Genie+ users through.

Express at Universal is more expensive ($80 to $300 per person per day) and it’s not something that most guests buy. You almost never see Express waits over 15 minutes, and that’s with them allowing Express users to just walk into the rides (no reservations needed). The standby lines also move at a much more steady and consistent pace, and almost never have to slow down since the Express lane is backed up.

Making fast passes more expensive can allow parks to still bring in extra revenue while providing a greater value for those that buy into the system and a better experience for everyone.

Edited to add: **Ideally, I’d prefer that paid “skip the line” services not exist at all,** and instead have either a free virtual queue system (like the old Disney FastPass) and/or just regular lines (as well as disability access services for those that need it). It’s just that since parks found this as a profit opportunity, and they likely won’t stop selling these, the next best thing is to make it expensive, rather than the affordable version like Disney’s Genie+.",unpopularopinion

It's easier to make has a more satisfying texture and is tastier. No need for blind baking, kneading, chilling, rolling out and all that faff.

When I say crushed biscuit I mean digestives (Graham Crackers in the USA) - there is an added bonus of flexibility that isn't possible with garbage short crust pastry and the likes: You can add ginger snaps or hobnobs to include ginger and oats into the fray. Some folk even go mental and crush oreos, although personally I feel that sort of hubris has folk flying a little too close to the sun.

Examples: 

Millionaires Shortbread - ditch the dense bland crappy base and use crushed biscuit base (we call this Caramel cake in Scotland) and it is a thousand fold better.

Cheesecake - I have never seen a short crust pastry base for cheesecake because it just wouldn't be good.

So now you might be thinking - but what about enclosed pies? The humble apple pie maybe? Well apple crumble is the crushed biscuit equivalent of a topping and is significantly tastier, versatile and has a far more satisfying texture. 

Another thing that absolutely sucks baws with pastry is the garbage scenario of trying to serve: The risk of the base not releasing from the tin or of the base being soggy, or cracking during cooking or of the sides collapsing once removed from the pie tin meaning the slice of pie is little more than a mess of broken pastry and dreams. A biscuit base and sides won't let you down.

The issue for me wasn’t with Cillian Murphy, rather it was with everyone else. When so many well known faces are used in one film, I find it sort of breaks the illusion of the people they are portraying. 

Cillian was so well cast. He looked the part and his performance was phenomenal.

I've read quotes from Trent Reznor and Maynard James Keenan among others, dismissing Limp Bizkit as garbage music. I love Tool and NIN, and have great respect for both, but it seems to me that these assessments are from an emotional place and don't really evaluate the music.

I would agree that a lot of the persona and subject matter coming from Fred Durst is somewhat juvenile. He's not guilty of trying to probe the depths of reality,  but that doesn't necessarily make the music low-quality. John Otto, Wes Borland and Sam Rivers are particularly talented. I consider John Otto to be a truly excellent drummer, easily in the top 50.

Secondly, the word these people who throw around ""judge"" seem to really mean is ""condemn,"" but I doubt too many people who use ""judge"" all the time even know what that means.

Condemnations are definitive and negative, and most people who talk about people judging other people act like you as an individual aren't allowed to draw some kind of conclusion based on the information you get from that person. Of course you can, but you can also have the cognizance to know that that INITIAL judgment is likely to change and might be inaccurate. THAT'S OKAY. It's outright condemning someone about whom you have very flimsy very little information about that is an actual problem that yes, plenty of people have.

Again, everyone is supposed to draw conclusions. It's how you make decisions, it's how you learn, and it's how you survive. However, those conclusions should be based on logic instead of ego, and people should be self-aware of their own biases and be mature enough to know when and when not to act on them.

So many people complain about ""being judged"" that it just sounds like whining at this point, because it's overused, just like any other played out buzzword, and to the point that it has little to no weight. It's so overused that these days it sounds like the one's complaining are the one's being judgmental of people who just disagree with them as well as the people who are actually condemning them, and it's that flagrant use of the word that makes them sound childish.

1884,1705691834.0,Quarterbacks shouldn’t be ELIGIBLE to win MVP,"  
Every year this conversation pops up during the back half of the season and every year it’s a QB save for a few years here and there.  
This has never made sense to me.  
We are shown time and time again that QBs are completely dependent on everything aligning around them to be great. You need an excellent o-line, excellent WRs, a RB that can keep the defense honest and a defense that can actually get you the ball back. How can a QB be the most valuable player on a team if their success depends on so many factors than have nothing to do with them?   
Patrick Mahomes is a great example of this. We all know that Mahomes is a generational talent that will be great at football for a VERY long time but he wasn’t even in the conversation this year because his WRs kept dropping passes and Kelce was distracted because he was off somewhere falling in love. So this year he wasn’t even in the conversation and yet last year he won it?  
Huh?!   
Now this is NOT me saying that QBs aren’t important. They obviously are. But Purdy isn’t in the conversation without CMC. Tua isn’t in the conversation without Hill etc etc. Giving them the title of MVP when an injury to another player can completely tank their production is nonsense. ",unpopularopinion

In the same village, just a couple houses away, there are people who are physically weaker yet working their ass off at every opportunity and using that money to send their children to colleges in the city. It's pretty obvious which family will get out of poverty and which family won't.

I also see a similar story in western countries. Some people will make any excuse possible to avoid working hard. They will say ""Working hard is useless. You need to be born with some special talent or be born in a special family with a great network.""

On the other hand, there are people who will work their ass off and use every opportunity and network to make their financial situation as good as possible. They live below their means and invest some money.",unpopularopinion

1891,1705654079.0,People are half decent.,"I think while everyone has something monstrous inside them somewhere that can come out in the worst situations, I believe at bottom most of us are half decent. Human beings operate as social animals at bottom, and of course you have your sociopaths who enjoy the act of disrupting the well being of others they are quite rare. Most humans who do wrong by others do so without conscious awareness of themselves. To get a mass of people to commit terrible acts you require narratives and ideologies to drive them to do so. This is where the issues of evil on a grand scale spring from in my view, we need things like this to suppress our nature.

I don't believe in free will. I believe what interrupts us acting as we naturally are, that being half decent, is the maladaptive ideas and conditions we create for ourselves which can be changed. I think generally many of us view people as evil, bad, or at the minimum dangerous. Or the very weak ""50 50"" non commital views, said to simply avoid the issue altogether.

1894,1705632729.0,"We are responsible for the housing crisis, not big banks/investment companies/corportations. Millennials and new home owners - it’s your fault…","It’s not a surprise nobody can afford housing anymore, because everyone, and I mean everyone, uses housing as an investment. 

It’s funny to see my grandparents, parents, aunts, uncles and extended family, who had average jobs (teacher, machinist, salon or even corporate roles) think that their duplex house on a half acre is worth 500k-1M or more. Yet they are acutely aware they would never be able to afford a house like that on their current or former salary. They hope to sell their property to either downsize and purchase that new corvette (aunt did) or just rent out their property at stupid rates so the renter pays their nursing home bills (great uncle).

How did this happen? It’s us. We are agreeing to pay these dumb prices. Maybe our generation got used to taking out impossible loans to pay back (school loans are so delectable), maybe too many got excited about quick home appreciations during the 08 bubble and think that home prices go zirp forever, or maybe this is the first time we’re seeing generational wealth being accumulated and passed down from boomers in mass causing the spike. Yet almost everyone from the older generation has the audacity to sell their home for more money than they probably generated in their entire life - knowing very well they could never afford that in the last or now.

Regardless, whats keeping the prices high is us. If millennials and new homeowners collectively withheld their desire to take out that meaty mortgage, prices would drop. I for sure don’t think my aunts shitty home is worth the amount she sold it for and it would make me even more mad that she would buy another smaller home with the cash and a new corvette with the money she got from her previous house, all the while the new homebuyer is living house poor in my aunts old home. And they are making more than my aunt did when she bought the house.

So we have to toughen up and find more creative ways to find shelter and save for retirement. Stop buying homes and renting at stupid prices. Do it long enough, prices will go down. This may mean staying with parents, find super cheap shitty rental, or even sleeping in car. Or buy a house and join the mob by renting out rooms for stupid prices to pay your mortgage. I know it’s not ideal - but my aunt and uncle don’t care - they just want you to pay for their shit. And they raise their rents every year with no complaints because us idiots keep paying.

The problem is once prices do go down, tragedy of the commons kicks in and we’ll probably end up in the same mess.

Regardless, it sucks to be in this mess. Reality check is we have to stop paying the dumb prices by being creative with shelter. And maybe we can get prices to come down… for the next generation haha",unpopularopinion

Good a few months have passed type movie (I watched it 6-7 months after a break up). But not good for those who just went through it, especially for the first time. It would hurt to see the protagonist go through what he has been through without you personally even starting. And then he finds a perfect girl coincidentally?!?  Nah I’d be so upset if I watched it a week after my last breakup vs months later when I was in a better headspace


To each their own but this is my two cents. Also I can see how it can be ok for breakups after very short term relationships or if it isn’t your first relationship/breakup, but not for a first or bad one imo. Especially if cheating was involved. I don’t like to compare (as it is the thief of joy) but during depressing times my mind just does it for insecurities and etc.

1898,1705612698.0,"Locking all items up, Is a good idea.","

Recently, at one of the stores i frequent, we witnessed a middle aged woman attempt to steal some things and walk out with her cart (and she was with a few people who of course, just left her) when she thought she was just going to be able to run out the door, she was met with employees and the lost prevention security from behind and in front of her. When she tried to get past them, they took her to the ground, her shoes flew off and hit the door. But not all stores, do this.
 
So I hear it all the time lately, about how frustrated people are about either being watched by employees when looking at locked up items and just having to wait on an employee to open it so you can purchase it, so now people are choosing to shop online more often, which is great since you'll have no option but to pay.

I mean, it seems to be a good chunk of society thinks it's no problem to steal anything and everything and use the excuse of ""Well, they're a big business, they have insurance, it's not going to hurt the business, they make a lot of money anyway."" Yea, well THAT'S the exact attitude that has got us here in the first place.

People can deny it all they want, but there's plenty of videos that have captured these kinds of people, in groups, obliterating stores. Or the cases of maybe 2 or 3 people walking out with full carts of stuff and running to the car to drive away without paying so in my opinion, it's well deserved. You want to inconvenience places with your  ""I don't have to, I'm entitled, i deserve this stuff"" Attitude, then you should have prepared to be treated that way, and you have ruined it for the rest of us who actually pay for our things. 

I'm surprised they haven't used this idea for clothing sections. I get some stores have ""tags"" or something similar to prevent theft of clothing, but a lot of times that doesn't work. Maybe they should renovate clothing sections as well so all that is on a rotating swivel, also locked up. (Like they do with jewelry) and in order for you to try it on, they have to come unlock it as well. And then implement a rule at the changing rooms, to have the employees actually check you before leaving that section, to be sure you're not hiding stolen property. 
(I understand this is a far reach. But IMO, the ""no chase, no confront"" rule should be changed. The Irate, angry, confrontational when they are caught people should be banned. And by doing so, less people will act that way knowing they won't get away with a temper tantrum. And by destroying property in an angry fit, is usually a jail sentence).

I understand, that for those who aren't thieves are irked by it. It sucks that it's unfair, but it's those who do steal, that have ruined it for the rest of us like i said. It's not the businesses fault for taking these extra steps so that they actually stay in business.",unpopularopinion
