1597545078.0,unpopularopinion,"Middle aged guys don't buy sports cars because they're having a ""mid-life crisis,"" it's because they can finally afford the car they want.I hate hearing people say, ""oh, he bought a Corvette because he's balding and needs to feel younger."" No. No no no no NO. As someone who's never earned much money because I made the spectacular decision to do what I love rather than what was lucrative, I'm finally in a position in my late 30s where I can actually save up to buy my dream car.

I get it if cars aren't important to you. I get it if you dislike the impact they have on the environment. I get it if you think sports cars are too expensive and a hassle. I get it if you see a forty something guy in a BMW M3 and assume he's compensating for something. But realize that automotive enthusiasm is a huge part of life for a lot of people, and can often be the biggest connection they have to family members or friends. 

As a car enthusiast, I look forward to increased electrification for a lower carbon footprint (and ridiculous torque for better acceleration). I accept that my budget will have to increase for a cool exotic car and decrease for other pursuits. It's worth it to me. Just like you might enjoy collecting stamps or having a closet full of nice clothes. It's also the first thing I talk about when I call my dad since he used to race cars and motorcycles in the 70s. We bond over cars and car news.

So the next time you see some guy with graying temples and a widow's peak driving a Ferrari, understand it might be the realization of a dream from childhood and try to, you know, not crap on that dream because it's not YOUR dream.",1646,310,1

When i first heard the word i thought it was stupid, but the older i get the more and more i realise how much i would easily use ""Y'all"" in every day life.

I'm a manager in my office so i often have to refer to multiple people at a time, ""You all"" or ""You lot"" or ""All of you"" is fine for now but can come off quite harsh, i've now rotated ""Y'all"" into the mix and it just FITS so well. Its soft, comes out friendly. Everyone knows what i mean, it rolls off the tongue nicely and i get to put that sweet southern accent on when i say it.

1595436915.0,unpopularopinion,"Most soldiers do not “fight for our rights” but rather fight for money, a career, or by compulsion from a draft.The last war that was really about “our rights” was the civil war. Vietnam, WWI, II, Korea, Iraq and Afghanistan were really about global power dynamics. The soldiers that fought in these wars were not defending our rights, because our rights were not really being threatened.

Edit: this has been very interesting! A few points to address.

1.	A repeat theme is that WW2 was about American Rights. I politely disagree. The US entered only after being attacked and having its global position threatened. We had no choice. We had been declining for 5 years to enter the war. Now I guess it’s very true that many people joined the military after Pearl Harbor out of a sense of duty. But I just have a hard time seeing how it was a war for our rights. It was 100% a just war. But much of the justification was learned of only after the fact (most Americans didn’t know of the atrocities happening at concentration camps). 

2.	I never said there was anything wrong with joining for any reason other than patriotic duty. Join for whatever reason! I’m all for it. 

3.	This last point is very important. Many have said that without the military we wouldn’t have all these freedoms and rights so they therefore are fighting for our freedoms and rights by simply existing. This is an interesting notion. Because from my vantage point as an American, our military is the most powerful it has ever been, yet I have seen a steady derogation of American rights and freedoms throughout my entire life - from within. Being a super power does not somehow make our freedoms more secure. It’s actually the opposite IMO. The lack of a credible threat means our government can actually take away our rights without being checked. Look at China and Russia where it’s happening today and has happened for a while. Look at the last 12 years in the US (increased surveillance, Portland, police brutality etc).",1999,352,1

1603376546.0,unpopularopinion,"Math is awesome and the only reason people don't like it is that schools are shit at teaching it.In my opinion, math is the most beautiful of any ""traditional school subject,"" but the thing is schools are set up in a way that encourages teaching math as a bunch of formulas to memorize. And real math is seldom about memorization. I heard a friend describe math as ""the most useful game humanity has ever created"" and I have to say I agree with that. Math is like a game, it's a playground where you try to extrapolate truths from a set of rules. I will now spend the rest of this post explaining parts of math that are ignored in schools but are super interesting to me. My explanations don't use any technical math terms, but some of the videos linked will require some thinking.

1.) fractals: You might have heard of these before. Essentially, they're shapes that no matter how much you zoom into them, they're still rough. They never end up looking straight like a polygon or curved like a... curve. Some of my favorite are the [Mandelbrot set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPHbgHVxLYY), the [burning ship fractal](https://softologyblog.wordpress.com/2017/02/24/the-burning-ship-fractal/), and the [Sierpinski triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle). All of these are mathematical objects that have infinite complexity but are governed by relatively simple rules. The Sierpinski triangle is just putting triangles in triangles, and the other two use something called ""complex numbers"" which sounds very obtuse, but can actually be explained in under 30 minutes. But these fractals are even crazier: we often think of shapes in terms of how many dimensions they have. A line is 1D, a square is 2D, a cube is 3D, etc. But by a certain definition, fractals have a **fractional** dimension. So. for example, that Sierpinski triangle is about 1.585 dimensional. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4) for details

2.) Chaos theory: ever heard of the term ""the butterfly effect?"" This actually originated from a field of math called chaos theory, which studies systems that are sensitive to initial conditions. One example of a system they study is called the Lorentz Attractor, which is a simplification of the laws that govern the weather. What I love about the Lorentz attractor, is that when you ""solve"" it with a computer, it draws out paths that look like these [beautiful butterfly wings](https://imgur.com/a/0FS86tI). Let me make that clear: a couple of mathematical equations draw out something that looks as beautiful as that. There isn't human intervention in that drawing, that's just what the equations draw. There's also the [Chaos Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs) which uses probability to draw things. When you run the chaos game on certain initial conditions, you get this [absurdly accurate drawing of a fern](https://imgur.com/CizSVy1). Again, none of this is done by a human, all of these works of art are made entirely by solving mathematical equations. If you find that out and don't want to learn more, you're crazy

3.) Unexpected results: Let's take a second to play a [game of pool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEfHFsfGXjs). We'll knock one pool ball (ball one) into another (ball two), and count how many times they collide with each other or the wall. Then, let's change the mass of one of the balls and see how that affects the collision count. Tell me if you notice a pattern

    Mass of ball 1    Mass of ball 2      Collision #
    1kg               1kg                 3
    100kg             1kg                 31
    10000kg           1kg                 314
    1000000kg         1kg                 3141
    100000000kg       1kg                 31415
    10000000000kg     1kg                 314159
    1000000000000kg   1kg                 3141592

Now you might not notice it, because it's not something you'd expect, but when you increase the mass by 100x, the collision count adds **another digit of pi**. Again, hitting some balls against each other writes out **the digits of pi**. I find that crazy. Pi is normally about circles: I don't see a circle. And pi is counting something. When was the last time you saw it do that? In the words of the legendary math educator Grant Sanderson ""If you have a **soul** you need to know why!""

I could name more instances of math being beautiful, but I think these three should be sufficient for a silly Reddit post. However, even if I didn't completely change your view of math, I hope you understand why people like me love it.

Edit: I just looked at this post on my phone. God that chart looks horrible. Why can't code blocks look consistent on all devices?

Edit 2: I'm not saying that teachers who teach math don't try, I just think it's inherently incredibly difficult for 1 person to teach 50+ kids math every day.

Edit 3: I'm aware of dyscalculia. The use of ""only"" in the title was a bit of an exaggeration, however, I do feel like for the vast majority of people they simply aren't taught in a way that suits them.",5086,801,1

If my kid wants to play single-player games, even if they have gores, horrors, sex scenes. I don’t mind letting them play these games because I trust my ability to guide them and to point out and explain any potentially problematic areas.

But with social media, things are totally different. While Instagram and Facebook, Snapchat still let you just engage with your friends, many others just open up to the public and anyone can engage. Things like Discord, Twitter, and pretty much everything comments section under an online video and online game voice lobbies. Knowing that behind those aren’t codes and pixels but real

1600010644.0,unpopularopinion,"A lot of the television shows using fully adult actors in a high school setting could easily change their plot to revolve around a college setting instead of the weird fixation television has on displaying the sex lives of high schoolersI think a good example of this is the show Riverdale. If you don’t know, it’s a show using the characters of Archie comics in a teen murder drama ish show. In that show their lives are about whatever big mystery is going on, their relationships, and their friends. The characters in the show are high-school age (16 I believe) but a majority of the cast are actors in their mid-twenties (one actor is almost 29). 

In the show, or as much as I’ve seen, being an actual high school student occupies very little of the character’s lives and the aspects of high school we do see the characters participate it could more or less be translated into a college setting. So why even make them high school students? I know to reach a youth audience and whatever but seeing how a lot of this shows content displays varied sexual relationships between characters, I feel like it’s a bit weird seeing all these high school age relationships so graphically being acted by much older people. 

And I’m realizing now that Riverdale isn’t the *best* example (a plot point of season 1 is an inappropriate teacher student relationship) but there are a lot of shows like this out. I think Hollywood should stop fetishizing high school sexual relationships when they really don’t have to. My issue with it isn’t so much the displays of sex, more that the show creators are leaning so heavily into all the displays of sex of people who are **supposed** to be minors. Gives a weird voyeurism vibe. If the plot allows, just make the setting college, it would even make more sense with the plots sometimes.

TLDR: I have no issue with sex being a plot point in teen-oriented television but the mentality of “We have 27 year olds playing 16 year olds so let’s shoot this soft core porn scene because we can 😎” is very problematic and approaching borderline pedophilic

When I reached my late 20s I realized that most adults are just fatter uglier kids. Like, theyre morons. They still dont know anything, many have never even read a book. Theyre dumb af to be honest, fumbling around doing everything wrong. The average adult in the street is dumber than even the most idiotic kid in school, at least the kid has potential.

1610612613.0,unpopularopinion,"Not learning (or worse, not teaching your kids) to swim is one of the absolute stupidest things you could doSwimming is like walking, but for water. It's part of the few basic means of movement we, humans, have at our disposal, along with running, crawling and climbing. Not knowing how to swim puts you at a HUGE disadvantage, as you pretty much can't avoid water. Any mildly interesting / fun activity might turn into a potentially lethal one, should you not know how to swim. Going fishing? Better not fall into the water... It's like permadeath for video games: instead of ending up wet, and maybe slightly (or very) cold, you just friggin' die if you fall into deep water. I know, swimmers can drown too, but if you can't swim, you're guaranteed to have to be rescued.

On another note, it's so weird to see healthy people being incapable of performing the most basic human activities: I've seen grown men injure themselves trying to climb over a 3 feet fence (not drunk), women twisting their ankles and tearing tendons when running towards a bus stop, etc. Now, I'm not saying that everybody needs to be a world-class climber like Adam Ondra or swimmer, like Michael Phelps. But learning how to... I don't know, not die when navigating anything but flat terrain seems like it should be part of being a grown human.

Edit: Jesus Christ this blew up... Most of the negative responses are about not having access to swimming facilities (either due to lack of money / lack of said facilities or both). I'm obviously not suggesting someone shouldn't eat for 3 months to pay for swimming lessons or move to an area just to learn. 

But ""I'm scared of water / I've had a bad experience"" are not valid excuses, all the more, they're reasons to push your boundaries and defeat said fear. It's like saying ""I've had my heart broken in high school, I will NEVER date again"". Sure, you can avoid both water and dating, but is it worth it?

If their first instinct, as soon as they get out from under your thumb, is to completely ignore you forever, you need to own the fact that you messed up as a parent at several, consistent, points along the road throughout your child's upbringing. They hate you for a good reason, and they're probably better off without you in their lives.

There are a number of forms of abuse that range from over-parenting, to neglect, over-discipline to straight up negative enabling behavior.

I have friends who don't talk to their parents because the strictness was so suffocating, and friends who don't talk to their parents because they were lazy bums who never took an interest in their child's life. There are tons of other reasons kids abandon relationships with their folks, but the one thing that stays true through all of these experiences for me is that it's always the parents fault.

This is mostly about relationships that end as soon as the kid leaves the house, not necessarily relationships that break down during adulthood, although the same reasoning could be applied in a lot of these cases too.

EDIT:  
To the people in the comments defending parents and blaming the kids: If you're a kid defending your parents then congratulations on having parents who treated you fairly and cared for you I'm sincerely happy for you (everyone didn't get the same life you did), if you're a parent defending yourself then just own up to the fact that you messed up and move on with your life, try to be happy and leave your kids alone because they've cut you out for very good reasons and they're better off without you.",1737,304,1

If you read through these articles, you will find that the theme is *men bad* because they refuse to play the social role written for them. It's mostly from the perspective of how this creates problems for women in the long run, but still that's the core of it.

Contrary to what these journalists would have you believe, I think these young men are acting completely rationally when opting out of this life script. There just aren't enough incentives to play this role, it is too risky and too exhausting, and I can personally see how one would derive way more satisfaction from hanging out with ones mates, playing video games, or being in a band. Young men don't owe society anything. We should just live and let live, and let people enjoy their lives in the way they want to, instead of judging them.

1573061213.0,unpopularopinion,"""OK boomer"" is a completely reasonable and well-deserved response from Millennials and younger generations due to the mess that the previous generations left us to deal with and their refusal to take responsibility for their actions.Facts:

•	Millennials earn 20% less than baby boomers did—despite being better educated 
( https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/05/millennials-earn-20-percent-less-than-boomersdespite-being-better-educated.html )

•	Cost of college has gone up at 8 times the rate of wages 
( https://www.forbes.com/sites/camilomaldonado/2018/07/24/price-of-college-increasing-almost-8-times-faster-than-wages/#6ba328a466c1 )

•	There is not one single state in the United States where a full-time, just-above-minimum-wage job can support a 1 bedroom apartment 
( https://www.businessinsider.com/minimum-wage-worker-cant-afford-one-bedroom-rent-us-2018-6 ). 

•	Student loans now make up the largest chunk of non-housing debt in America, and many ""entry level"" jobs now require a degree.
( https://www.finder.com/student-loans-account-for-36-35-of-non-housing-debt )

•	Cost of living is up 300% or more since the 1970s but wages are only up 50-70%. 


For example, the Bureau of Census reports that the average price of a new home in June 1998 was $175,900.

According to inflation, that price today should be $271,931. The same report places the average sale price for June 2018 at $368,500, however, more than 35% higher than the price when accounting for inflation alone. 

A gallon of gas in 1994 cost $1.06, making it $1.64 in June 2014, when adjusted for inflation. The actual national average price, as of July 2018, is $2.88 – 75% higher than what it would be if inflation were the only cause for the increase.

The median household income in 1998 was $38,885. The most recent year with full data available is 2017, so adjusting for inflation as of that year gives a median income of $58,487. The Bureau of Census reports that the actual median 2017 income was $59,000 – higher than the adjusted figure, but not by very much, and certainly nowhere near the percentage that prices have outpaced inflation.

This did not happen by accident - this happened because of greed. CEO salary and shareholder profits have outstripped wages and cost of living by a factor of between 3 and 8 depending on the source you read. 

Millennials TRULY have it harder than our parents did.

•	We cannot afford to ""put ourselves through school"" working a part time job - they could. 

•	We cannot afford to have one parent stay at home - they could. 

•	We cannot afford to buy a house on a single income - they could. 

And yet, Boomers have the audacity to tell us that we need to just work harder, pull ourselves up by our boot straps. That we're lazy and entitled. 

No, we're not. The data shows that Millennials work just as hard as our parents generation, but we struggle more. 

For years now, when Boomers have told us, ""you're lazy and entitled"" and we need to ""just work harder"", we've tried to explain this to them - and they don't listen. 

We learned that there's no point in trying to convince them - nothing will change their mind. So now we just say, ""OK boomer"".

1597668902.0,unpopularopinion,"Everyone SHOULD feel unsafe and alert when walking the streets at night. It's not oppression, it's a necessary survival instinct.Mentally twisted, ill, fucked up people will always exist, and both women and men need to have the appropriate psychological and physiological response to prepare for such a threat, particularly when we are alone and vulnerable in the dark. Striving for a world where women (or more generally, **everyone**) can roam freely at night is unrealistic.

I regularly hear that women should not have to feel unsafe walking alone at night, as a result of the patriarchy and men preying on vulnerable women. Apparently it's a common assumption that men do not feel this pressure whatsoever, which is entirely bullshit. Everyone **should** feel this way when walking alone at night. Anything can happen to anyone.

I'm a white male and have been assaulted walking home from work last year, when a group of drunk men asked me to have a drink with them, I declined and they yelled slurs at me and threw empty glass bottles at me. One of my male school friends, who is a bodybuilder, was stabbed walking late at night.

We *all* feel that way because we need to be psychologically and physiologically prepared to flee a threat. Sketchy, fucked up people will always exist, unfortunately. They prey on vulnerable targets, and night time is the peak for these twisted fucks as it is isolated and dark, and when most are drunk.

If we hypothetically reach a state where people can feel entirely safe walking alone at night, they are more vulnerable and unsuspecting to possible attacks. We need to be alert. It's our natural response to trying to stay the fuck alive.

Edit: I probably used 'unsafe' and 'alert' interchangeably when they have different meanings. This is poor phrasing on my behalf, what I mean is that we should be alert. We shouldn't feel unsafe at all times, but rather we should recognise that the environment can be unsafe. ",1959,333,1
1580911264.0,unpopularopinion,"Young men are dropping out of society because it's abundantly clear nobody gives a shit about themThe majority of homeless people are men. The majority of suicide deaths are men. Young men graduate college less than young women. Young women are out-earning young men. Single women are more likely to own a home than single men. There are gross discrepancies in the amount of government aid available to men and that available to women.

Yet I've never seen women marching to end male homelessness. I've never heard a radio ad about raising money for prostate cancer. I've never seen a commercial asking men if maybe it's time to give college a second chance. Literally, nobody cares if you live or die. Nobody cares if you're educated or fulfilled. Nobody cares about you.

And you will be openly mocked, belittled, and humiliated if you don't fit into the predefined social mold that exists for men. Homeless? Fuck off. Small dick? Haha. Suicidal? Ew.

Why bother trying to be part of society that at best ignores you, and at worst is openly antagonistic towards you? I've seen so many articles like this: ""Why are young men dropping out? It must be because educated women scare them."" They always come to the same, obtuse, and illogical conclusions. ""Men are just stupid/lazy/useless/onerous in some way, I guess. Women are better anyways.""

Young men are dropping out because they are treated by society like actual, literal disposable objects. That's the real reason.

Edit: To everyone asking me in the comments why women should be responsible for helping men, this is the reason: Feminism by its literal definition is about fostering gender equality. If men are disproportionately negatively affected by things like homelessness, violence, a lack of education, and presumptions of criminality, then these are inherently feminist issues.

And its true. Women have support systems for their depression, they have systems in place and people are much more prone to be sympathetic to women and don't want to see a woman suffering, people want to help and show they are not alone.


But for men we are alone, partially because of the traditional view that men cannot show weakness, but the biggest reason is no one cares. People don't just not care they distance themselves from you. Men and women will just walk away or show a miniscule amount of compassion. Men know that expressing our depression or darker thoughts is a terrible idea because it will make matters worse, not better. 


There is this modern trend that traditional gender roles cause men not to talk about this, I think that's a small component of the reason, but its because most of us know if we come forward with our issues, the people around us and society at large will largely shun us.

1584176014.0,unpopularopinion,"Disney is overrated and people are brainwashed into loving it more than they should.There is no legitimate reason why best animated film is going to Disney every single year, almost without fail, since the award was invented in 2001. 2017 is probably the best example for this. The two greatest animated films that year were Loving Vincent and the Breadwinner. Loving Vincent was revolutionary in terms of medium, having each frame be a full oil painting. It also told a beautiful story and the cinematography was magnificent. Breadwinner was also a magnificent story about a Middle Eastern girl searching for her father. Either of these films should have won best animated picture, but they didn't. They lost to Coco. Don't get me wrong, Coco was good, almost great even. But it was nowhere near as revolutionary nor as important a story as Loving Vincent or the Breadwinner. Coco won simply because it was Disney Pixar. The only reason Disney is winning every year is because they are overrated and super well known, whereas these other films are indie films. But the best picture shouldn't go to a film because of the company that produces it, but rather because of the quality and importance of the films itself. Indie films and 2d animated films continually get stumped by Disney for best animated picture. In fact, only once did a 2d film win, and only once did a foreighn film win, and that one time for both of those was when Spirited Away won in 2002. Never again has a 2d or foreign film won, and never has an indie film won. 

Disneyland is a fucking scam. It's a 1984 community that feels so eerily unsettling and inhuman. They brainwash people with their slogans like ""happiest place on earth"" and they cover up anything bad from their audience. Not to mention the corporate greed, and the continuous raising of prices for tickets. Disney also own half of Anaheim city, and most of the nearby hotels and motels are secretly owned by Disney. Some goes for the nearby gas stations, diners, etc. Disney pretty much runs the city of Anaheim in secrecy, and the Anaheim government is perfectly fine with that because they get big paychecks out if it. Disneyland isn't even as great as everyone says it is. The only reasons people go so much is because people are sad, and where better to go than what is advertised as the ""happiest place on earth""? People take their kids there because they think that their kids have to go to Disneyland at least once to have a good quality childhood. People I know seem to go to Disneyland often simply to show how fucking rich and well off they are. They're using Disneyland as a way to express their higher class, not as a way to actually enjoy themselves. Walt Disney imagined a Utopia, but it seems to me that he got a Dystopia instead. He wanted to use his money for good, for human progress in technology, but instead the company hoards it and just uses the money to get even more money. Imagine the good charity that the company could do with their money. That is what Walt wanted. He wanted money for the people, not for the corporation.

Working at Disney is terrible. If you work in animation, any drawing you produce at the time, whether on duty or not, are the property of Disney. This prevents people from being able to do freelance or to work for other companies at the same time. (This also means that theres vaults of cartoon porn that Disney owns because the artists draw shit like that for shits and giggles). If you work at Disneyland, they treat you like shit and they don't pay well either. But hey, you get free tickets, so it's all good (sarcasm). Disney oppresses their employees and they get away with it all the time because they have big money. 

Disney is continuously fighting their competition until they win, and they almost alwats win. And by competition, I don't mean enemies, but allies too. This can be seen in the Sony argument where Disney continually demands more and more, until smaller companies have to give in because they know that they can't make it opposing such a powerful entity. This is what happened with Spiderman, as Disney got greedy and started demanding more profits and Sony said no, so Disney broke off their deal until Sony finally gave in because they'd make even less money if they cut ties with Disney all together than if they gave them most of the profits for Spiderman. This bullshit has been pulled off so many times by Disney.

Disney is taking over the film industry and the marketing industry and it pisses me off so much that almost everyone is just ok with that. Disney also keeps producing films that stump smaller films in awards because the game is rigged in favor of bigger entities. Movies like Frozen, Brave, the Incredibles, etc are only popular because of the company that is making them, not because of the quality of the films itself. People expect a Disney film to be good, and oftentimes people's opinions will be biased based on what they go in expecting. People need to support smaller companies and indie companies more often than they do, before there aren't any left to support.",5107,905,1

i would do this because that baby is nothing and is no one. babies are a blank canvas that take in information 24/7 to become who they are. we literally create, physically and mentally, humans.


so with this mentality, i'd say we can always have another. obviously obviously we both would be devastated. we're looking forward to having kids so so much, especially him. to lose the child my partner and i created would be life changing. but i think he and i can both say that we would rather have our children grow up with both parents. he would raise a baby well, i know it, but i cant imagine the depression he would fall into if i were to die. and having a child may not be enough for him to power through. i'll be damned if i set our fucking kid up for failure like we faced as children.


hope it makes sense. i dont want to kill babies or even make such a difficult decision but this is reality. and this is only during delivery, not in any other circumstance. i would rather talk and decide now rather than not have talked about it and he has to make that decision on his own. he would implode.


we can always have more babies while remembering any we've lost, which hopefully will be zero. i just dont think i could leave this earth with so so much unfinished business and leave behind a child i'd never meet and a husband that needs me as much as i need him. i dont want to do it. so this is my choice.

Why on earth do we wear labcoats? Who’s idea was this? What are we protecting our underclothes from exactly?

Its time we start to distinguish ourselves from other medical professions. Scrubs are for nurses. Labcoats are for doctors (and actual lab people).

It should be a requirement for pharmacists to wear capes to distinguish ourselves from others. There is no practical reason for wearing capes, I’ll admit, but neither is there a practical reason to wear a labcoat.

Additionally, I’m tired of being summoned to help a customer (probably with something incredibly stupid, obvious, or boring) without making a grander entrance. If I had a cape, I could briskly walk towards the costomer and come to a quick stop and allow the cape to flow up and consume me a little before I begin to speak.

I would want to do the cliche vampire reveal thing using one arm to hold half the cape in front of me and then toss it asside, but that would be very unprofessional.

If you ask me, it’s not enough that it’s prohibited in certain public spaces (a rule that is often not respected by smokers anyway).

\- Specifically a 220lbs, 5'11, well built male human, quite used to tossing around objects weighing much more than 180 lbs, who has also played contact sports his entire life.

\- I do not need to kill the human, just take out all of their organs and cause massive bleeding.

\- As mentioned, specifically a 220lbs, 5'11, well built male human, quite used to tossing around objects weighing much more than 180 lbs, who has also played contact sports his entire life.

\- I weigh 180 lbs and am 6ft tall

\- I have eaten 5 large dogs and ""have those dawgs in me"" as humans may say.

The fight:

In a boxing match, I win as I am much stronger. They would be unable to run away as I am much faster. Neither of these are viable options. Thus I only see two options in which they emerge the victor.

The first way would be for them to choke me out. They would need to avoid my mouth and paws , but if they were able to get behind me due to my poor eyesight (I know we have good eyesight but I had another guy try to fight me last year and he tried poking my eyes out while we fought and it hasn't really been the same since, absolutely mauled that guy tho lol). I would have to have a very thin neck and not think of retaliating against this at all, even though I can kill him with a single swipe.

The second way would be for them to blind me. In this scenario they would need to be fully prepared to sacrifice an arm, a leg, their testicles, two eyes, a nose, half an ear, their scalp, a kidney, and their lungs, and while I am attacking them, they would use sticks or fingers to try to blind me. I am aware that I have small eyes, however, if they really concentrated while I was having a nice liver breakfast, I believe they might be able to hit their target.

People keep going on and on about those first ten minutes like they are the pinnacle of animation. But in my mind, I think Pixar basically botched what *could've been* one of the actual greatest animated moments. I feel like those 10 minutes were always meant to be shown in the *middle* of the film. Almost as if they decided to make that sequence the opening as an afterthought.   


Throughout the first half of the film, Carl doesn't really open up to Russell; and we don't really know why he's so keen to get to Paradise Falls or why he cares so much about a stupid house (except we do know since we watched the opening). Eventually, we get a scene where Carl alone enters the broken house and takes out an old photo album, basically giving us another mini-version of the first ten minutes. I'm convinced that in an earlier draft of the script, the opening 10 minutes where intended to be shown during this scene. And I believe that if it had played out like that, the moment would've been 10 times more powerful than it is in the final film. Because then everything would click, suddenly we would understand why this stubborn old man behaved the way he did. The buildup would make that emotional punch much stronger.  


But the way the film is now; we go into the movie seeing a montage about a character we are yet to  care about; and throughout the entire film we know everything about Carl's life and motivations, making his reserved and introverted character pointless since we already understand.

I've been thinking about this opinion for a while now ever since I've hit my teenage years. This is because my mom always tells me ""If it weren't for god I would've **\[*****insert messed up action*****\]*****\****"". So when I got older, I realized just how messed up that actually is.

The reason as to why it is messed up  is because you should be a good person based on your own moral code, not religion. What if that religion never existed? What would you do if you all of a sudden didn't like religion anymore? What would you do then? Would you go, and kill people? Would rob banks? Would you do all the horrible things you wanted to do previously?

Those who think this way usually don't even know or care for the reason *why* they shouldn't do horrible things. They only seem to not do awful things only because they think that something bad will happen to them, based upon their religious belief.

*Now to clarify, this isn't to say that I hate people who believe in religion, or think all people who use religion in their life think this way (although, I do personally despise religion, as it has caused a lot of trouble in my life). This is to say that I think if you use religion as your entire reason for not doing awful shit, then you aren't a good person in my eyes.*

**\*Note: Some of the things my mother has said were REALLY bad. She even said that she would've killed me and my siblings by now if it weren't for god. Yeah.......Really. Smh.**

**Edit: WAY too many people keep saying that I think all people who are religious, think this way. Not true. I'm talking about a sizable amount of religious people who refrain from evil deeds simply because they fear harsh consequences based on their own religion.** ***I repeat not all people think this way, but a sizable amount of people do.***

**Edit 2: Displaying my opinion the internet isn't edgy.**

**Edit 3: Don't disregard what I say simply because of my age. If you think this way, you're being closed minded.**

**Final Edit: This is a nuanced topic, so there is a lot of room to debate here. I'm okay with that. However, please try to be respectful to others in this thread, and don't attack, and insult people for their own beliefs on the matter.

1600881035.0,unpopularopinion,"Paparazzis should be able to get charged for harassment and the invasion of privacy by celebrities.There is nothing okay about photographing people in public without consent, the same should apply for celebrities.


Imagine, you have something that puts you in the public eye a lot, whether it’s your job or something to do with being part of a famous family. And one day you’re going for a walk in the park when suddenly someone starts following you and taking pictures of you before you can even make direct eye contact with them, just snapping photos of you like you’re some kind of landmark. What will they do with those photos? Who knows? Not like it’s any of your business, right?


Let’s put it in a different perspective. What if you aren’t a celebrity, you’re just some average joe on your way home. Would it be ok for someone to yell “hey! Smile! Ooh turn your head this way for me!” Whilst they start following and photographing you? Of course not, that’s pretty much the definition of an invasion of privacy. So why is it ok to do it to a celebrity? And how well known do you have to be for them to get away with it?


I genuinely hate the “oh well it’s just one of the side effects to being famous” answer. No job or occupation should make it okay for people to snap photos of you whilst in public and doing stuff outside work.


Even at movie premieres, the places paparazzis are actually expected to be at, they take it too far by practically chasing them around whilst they try to leave the theatres.

Also half the time it’s done without the person even knowing that they’re being photographed, such as those annoying articles nobody even cares about where they talk about what they saw Demi Lovato have at Starbucks the other day. Nobody should have permission to make someone’s personal life public to everyone when they’re just doing the same thing as everyone else. If I started following the guy who owns my local KFC and started posting pictures of them and writing articles about what they do in their free time on Facebook then I’d probably get called a stalker and get sued for harassment. But it’s fine if said person happens to be famous?

Hell, Princess Diana was indirectly killed by paparazzis because she got in a car crash whilst trying to get away from the swarm of people chasing her! Someone literally died because they were so focused on escaping a group of paid stalkers that their car ended up crashing.

Paparazzis are the literal scum of the earth, the bottom of the food chain. Only able to survive by latching onto people with more money so that they can document the stuff that should be private. They’re like secret spies, except, instead of finding out about the enemy’s secret weapons projects, they’re filming someone’s daily life as if they’re one of the animals on a BBC documentary.

Another thing that I hate is when they make it sound like the celebrity is totally in on it and is intentionally attracting paparazzis. For example: when a celebrity is pregnant they say something like “[insert name here] shows off growing baby bump during walk in [insert location]!” As if they’re getting up on a stage and telling everyone when actually they were just walking around whilst pregnant. A pregnant woman isn’t “showing off” her belly just because you can see it, she’s just walking around and *surprise surprise!* it’s not really easy to hide your belly when it’s growing a mini person inside it.

I supported my wife every single day through her pregnancy and I helped her through the nausea, the body aches, and the terrible pain of giving birth. I know there are risks and complications and it's not something everyone wants to do. I wish I could do it, though.


My wife and I agreed we wanted a baby as soon as we had a house. Thankfully, she was able to become pregnant (I really feel for the women who can't have babies and wish they could) and we now have a toddler who is an absolute joy.


She loved being pregnant. Every day we talked about the baby growing in her womb that we couldn't wait to meet. I kissed her belly hundreds of times. And I fell in love with her all over again every time I looked at her. Her hand was pretty much glued to her belly, always rubbing it and humming a song. The bond that is formed between the mother and child is simply beautiful.


The hardest part about it is that I'll never be able to realize this wish and I never had a choice in the matter. Women can choose (in most cases) whether or not they want to become pregnant. And I don't know how the logistics of it all would work, anyway. Maybe if we lived in a world where both men and women were built with the capability to have babies, kind of like seahorses. I know it's not realistic, but if it were possible to give me a uterus transplant I'd consider it. I would go through considerable pain and effort if it meant I could get pregnant.


Every guy I've ever told has either looked at me like I'm insane or just straight-up laughed at me. Women I've told seem to understand, but nobody really takes it seriously except for my wife. She knows it's not a joke and that it's an actual dream of mine. Any guys out there agree with me?


Edit: Some people are rightfully pointing out that my wife's pregnancy went smoothly and that we are very fortunate. I do not disagree. However, I disagree that I have an idealized view of pregnancy. Just because things went well for her does not mean they would for me and does not mean they go well for others, but it also does not invalidate my feelings.

And, no, the positive reviews they keep getting really aren’t honest, and thats been getting more transparent in all the latest Marvel releases. 

From a craftsmanship perspective, they simply aren’t good films and have been barely nominated for technical awards. The stories are simplistic and very heavy on fan service and basic roller coaster action movie techniques. 

They’re almost identical to the Transformers movies, just with slightly better creative vision. 

No, I’m not the arbiter on what films are trash and what films are good, or anything, but the critics load up RT with fresh scores for every Marvel film with dozens of complaints about the films and just end up designating it “4 Stars” or “fresh” because “it’s fun, I guess” or “it’ll work for the audience it’s meant for”. These films are graded on a massive curve and the only reason people like them is because it’s in the zeitgeist to.

The news story was basically “How dare a medical professional say such a thing; my baby is perfect to me.” A lot of people called her a “hero” for continuing the pregnancy and giving birth. The baby died before her first birthday. 

If doctors are recommending termination, nature has decided the baby isn’t going to make it. Generally speaking, there are two instances where the parents decide to continue the pregnancy anyway. Either a) the parents are in total denial about the situation and are pretending it isn’t happening or b) the parents are putting their ideology/religious beliefs first.

IVF clinics trash more fertilized eggs a year than abortion clinics.

If you believe life begins at conception, i.e. fertilization, then any embryo that does not get implanted is murdered the same way an aborted embryo is murdered.

I’m African and I’ve realized that whenever I start talking to someone online and I mention that I do in fact live in Africa, the entire conversation goes sideways and then it becomes “how do you have internet?” “ do you see lions frequently?” And other weird questions like that. And I’m not the only one who gets questions like that. 

My mum went to the USA a couple years back for an internship at a Montessori school. She still keeps in touch with one of the teachers there via email and Facebook. But last week when they were talking about ideas for online school during this pandemic, the lady still asked if there was access to electricity and internet in our community. My mum was quite irritated and she had to explain that yes, we have internet access in our homes and business and that’s how we’re able to use social media and email. 

I understand that the media in these places depicts Africa as a place where people wear leaves and hides and sleep in huts but don’t all continents have villages and rural areas?

Not everyone has to climb palm tree to get internet access and no, I have never seen a lion or a giraffe outside the zoo. In fact, i think the ‘wildest’ animal I’ve seen outside the zoo is a garden snake. 

Thank you. 
P.S. I’m new to reddit so please don’t judge me too harshly. Cheers:)

P.S: A lot of people have been asking why I say I’m from Africa instead of specifying where exactly. When I say Lagos, Nigeria, they always ask “where is that?” Then I say Africa and the questions follow.

P.P.S: there are a lot of things I’d like to clarify 

1. None of said conversation happened on Reddit, or during quarantine 
2. Lagos is not the capital of Nigeria 
3. If you’re saying a larger percentage of people in Africa don’t have internet access, you are correct. But if you are chatting with people over the internet then is it too much to assume that they aren’t part of that percentage?
4. It has come to my notice that this sub isn’t the perfect place for this post. No need to bite my head off, I shall crosspost

I think it's great when people take a stand for social issues and I have no issues with being awake. However, this can go too far and it allows for people to become abusive *while thinking they are completely in the right*. That's an incredibly dangerous thing.


My ex was one of these people. She cared deeply about fixing social issues and because of that she felt it was fine to steamroll everyone she knew and cared about because their discomfort was worth the change she was pushing. To an extent, I even agree with that. She was way too hypocritical though. Eventually she became dead to my feelings. If she hurt me, I did something to deserve it, or I was overreacting out of fragility and needed to ""get a grip"". She was never willing to admit wrong, and my views were always tainted because I was a guy.


I spent way too long in that relationship hating myself because I respected her efforts for change. It wasn't until I sought therapy that I realized how hurtful she was being. Eventually I came to the conclusion that believing the same things she did didn't give her a pass to treat people awfully. So yeah, sometimes the most outwardly caring and seemingly empathetic people can be the most abusive ones in your life.

You have your own battles to fight and that's okay. 

I've noticed that recently there have been a lot of social media posts about dating people with mental health issues (eg. post like ""dating someone who understands ur mental health is soo important. there's humans who will make u feel terrible for things u can't or don't know how to control yet""). I feel that posts like this don't understand the impact it can have on the other person in the relationship. 

As someone who has been in a two-year relationship where I was the emotional dumpster for my former partner, I felt insanely guilty for even wanting to break up with them because I couldn't continue to support them in their mental health journey. My former partner would often blame for me not being understanding or patient enough. They snapped at me on multiple occasions when I was talking about my day and my work team and how fun my day at work was because it made them feel more depressed that their work team wasn't as close. Later in the relationship, I had learnt to only ask about how their day went but never share my own, in fear of not being supportive of their mental health. 

Now I know that not everyone with mental health issues will be like my former partner, but posts on social media perpetuate the stigma that YOU'RE the unempathetic/uncaring/non-supportive one if you can't understand your partner's mental health. 

It's not true. You're not a bad person for wanting to break up with them. It's okay to break up with your partner if they're being toxic. Being with someone who is going through mental health issues is draining and it's okay to break up with your partner if their mental health is too much for you. It's okay to not be an emotional dumpster for your partner. Please remember that you're a person too. You have your limits and your own mental health to take care of.

Yeah, as far as recreational drugs go it’s pretty harmless; it’s less toxic than alcohol, not chemically addictive, withdrawals aren’t physically painful, but it can still fuck up your life. Constantly getting stoned robs you of your motivation and impairs your ability to function like a normal person.

It’s also way more difficult to quit than most people think, especially if you’ve made it a daily habit. Trying to taper off rarely works because it’s so easy to smoke casually that you’ll never struggle to find an excuse for it. Going cold turkey sucks because you become irritable and impatient, your brain having been flooded with dopamine for so long that the things that would make a normal person happy have no effect on you.

I'm using the United States as the basis for this argument since in my country Portugal, we have a Communist Party but their members and people in general actually understand what they believe in and what they want if they managed to become the governing party - it's basically impossible at this moment and they have 7/8% or less every election. 

But in the US I come to realize that people actually have no idea what communism or communist ideas are. Socialism isn't equal to communism. Also, ""everything I disagree with"" isn't communism. You are just an idiot that chooses to be ignorant or that doesn't want to hear ""no"" more often than none.

I would even argue that most people can't even point if a political idea is mostly left or right-wing.

**EDIT 1:**

 It seems to be important to clarify that my goal was never to promote communism as some great idea that is the best option for your country or something. My only point was: people talk about stuff and equate it to communism when there is actually no evidence of it being the case or it being even remotely close in terms of what both represent.

In my interpretation and simplifying it, Communism is a socio-economical and political ideology based on a self-sustaining human existence that wants to promote an egalitarian society and with no social classes.

1598049403.0,unpopularopinion,"Gaming is a healthier medium for young adults than Social Media and YouTube in terms of mental healthGaming has a bad reputation for being addictive and frowned upon by parents since their kids seem to always be gaming and not doing anything productive. Although gaming can be addictive and a time sink, I argue that it's still much better to have a society interested in gaming, especially young adults, than all obsessed with social media and YouTube instead. Of course gamers also use social media and YouTube, but I'm talking about the hardcore users of these other mediums where they don't game and use that time to consume these other mediums more instead.

Social Media: Young adults using social media is terrible for their mental health. Apps like Instagram makes them feel like they need to show off fake affluence, stuff, or go on unnecessary trips to keep up with the Joneses. They need to document their life just because everyone else is and if they don't document it in a way that looks appealing to others , they're afraid of being judged. This is bullshit. On the other hand, if these people didn't put so much emphasis on social media and just games instead, there is no stupid competition between friends since the gamer doesn't value dumb stuff like that as much. They're too involved with the games to be interested in petty and vapid competition between peers.

YouTube: Yes, everyone watches YouTube. But non-gamers who put more time into YouTube I argue can be bad depending on the content they consume. YouTube has all sorts of content, but a lot of the content is paid propaganda to influence people to believe their political agenda. A lot of channels try to get kids to fall down an alt-right rabbit hole without them even realizing that it's happening, they're just browsing videos on YouTube to kill time then all of a sudden they have these right-wing beliefs that they probably wouldn't have if they didn't fall down a rabbit hole. 

Huge channels are funded by organizations to spread influence about their political beliefs, it's not a fair balance. Google doesn't care as long as they're getting paid. If these impressionable young adults were just playing video games, they'd stay away from the politics for the most part and disinformation out there.

1620729340.0,unpopularopinion,"Generic feel-good phrases such as ""you matter"" ""you are loved"" ""you're beautiful"" etc. are insulting and emotionally manipulative, and they make me feel much worse afterwards.Seriously, there seems to be a trend among some parts of the internet and real life to just flash faux motivational feel-good phrases like these to get cheap emotional responses from people who are truly desperate enough to believe that somewhere on the internet or in their vague proximity there is a person who actually genuinely cares about them. Sorry to break it to you, but they probably can't. How can you care about someone you don't even know personally? They have no idea who you are and you have no idea who they are. You are therefore completely blind to any reasons why you are truly loved by anyone, which makes perceiving this feeling as genuine extremely difficult, and impossible for me.

The sort of people who would actually unironically find these phrases motivational are so devoid of any positive social interaction (which I am not saying NEVER happens but is such a desperate situation) that any string of words vaguely resembling a heartfelt compliment brightens their day. The trouble is that these phrases masquerade as heartfelt compliments but are such cheap emotional signalling that anyone utilising a sliver of their human observation and reasoning can see that they are being emotionally manipulated.

The other day at school, I saw a message scribbled on my desk that said ""Whoever sits at this seat, know that you are loved #SpreadPositivity"". The vagueness in the wording baffled me. If someone sits at this seat, by virtue of just being there, they are loved, and I, sitting in another spot, am no longer told that I'm loved? If I am truly loved by anyone in particular, then the message would have been a lot more personal, and due to the circumstances in which that message is being presented, it could not be. That message would have had some positive effect on me if that were the seat I was assigned to (which would make the message take on a new meaning, hence why here it was used so generically), but no, it was a classroom shared by 4 grades above and below mine and due to COVID we have free seating. The message is not personal; I don't think the writer even knows who I am, and even if they did, it was not targeted at me, so I cannot personally feel good about anything in the message. If anything, seeing that message made me upset, knowing that my feelings have been pandered to in an attempt to have a cheap emotional response elicited from me. I felt manipulated. It was insulting, too; I do not need anyone to remind me that I am loved, especially not from an anonymous entity I don't even know. The message implies that the only criterion that I have to fulfil to be loved is to sit at that particular seat, which makes me feel that I do not actually deserve the praise, since I have not done anything worthy of that praise. I have to work my ass off to get the grades to make my teachers and parents happy, be funny and genuine with my friends to make them happy, and meticulously plan every encounter to make my girlfriend happy. I know that in order to be loved you must be willing to put in the effort, and any ""free love"" you get is not at all genuine. Consider this to be akin to an infinite fountain of counterfeit cash: while you can take as much as you want, all you get in the end is some free paper in case you run out of tissue or toilet roll.

This is a wider problem on the internet, where out-of-touch celebrities, influencers and even some of you on Reddit collectively tell us that we matter or that we are loved blah blah blah. Alright then, if we truly matter, then we don't need you to tell us that we do because we should be able to feel that every day! If our feelings need to be validated in such a way, would that not suggest that we are in fact not loved by many or do not matter to all but one or two? I do not feel any better after reading your post, nor do I appreciate that somehow I am targeted to be emotionally pacified. You only use such generic phrases because you are sure that it would apply to everyone, just as if you were tasked with buying me a shirt without knowing who I am you would probably just buy a plain black or white V-neck because it's such a safe choice, with no polarising or remarkable elements. I have no interest in what you say about me without knowing who I am. I do not deserve to be loved simply because I exist, I should be loved because of who I am and what I do, and if being who I am means that I will grind more people's gears, so be it. Being who I am is expressing my personality. Existing is not a personality.

A big part of what makes a compliment special is how personal it is. I cannot be made to believe that any celebrity, any influencer, or even that Redditor I have never interacted with before know me enough to genuinely compliment me. I know your intentions: You want to scribble something in real life or online, in the hope that someone would stumble upon it and you would brighten their day. But you did not brighten their day. It's an insulting, condescending and frankly manipulative genre of phrase that serves absolutely no purpose.

Anyway, I am by no means saying that we should just stop spreading any form of positivity and self-love. I understand some people are going through tough times in their life and need any emotional support they can get. In that case, establish connections with them in private, make them feel like you give a shit (even if you don't!), DM them, make them feel better as a person with lived experiences, not a publicity stuntman because you either want some Internet brownie points or just want to demonstrate to the world how virtuous and caring you are. Promoting love and positivity only works well if there is even a façade of reciprocity. If you were talking to a friend in great mental distress, your magnum opus surely would not be such a simple phrase overused to shit. So, treat people online as you would people in real life. Have a genuine two-sided conversation and step outside the box of virtue-signalling.

This new genre of feel-good phrases just doesn't work for me, and I'm very sure many other people feel the same way. I just don't see the majority of the Internet agreeing with this though (with all the positivity movements and shit), but hey, that's why I'm here ranting and you're here reading (hopefully). Thanks for listening :)

&#x200B;

tl;dr: What makes a compliment special is how personal it is. Phrases like the ones in the title used between strangers are so generic that they lose any sincerity left in them. Therefore, the people who use these phrases are (willfully or not) engaging in emotional manipulation and the person who unironically feels good in the face of these phrases are really, really fucking desperate and they might need actual help. In that case, stop and talk to them as a person.

&#x200B;

Edit 1: I see a lot of you in the comments commenting about how this is a symptom of a lack of empathy. I disagree. Empathy is when you can connect with someone's lived experiences because your imagination and lived experiences allow you to do that. In my case there is a complete lack of information: I don't know who wrote that on my table and the person who wrote it on my table don't know who I am (or even if they do, they most likely don't know I'm going to read it). When there is a complete lack of information, there is nothing to base empathy on.

Edit 2: To clarify, there is a difference (which I have probably not made very clear in my original post) between a conversation between two individuals that one appreciate the other and someone being told by an anonymous random message that they are loved. When this message means the same to everyone, it means nothing to everyone. Telling someone that they are loved (or equivalent) is a personal sentiment. When you, while writing the message, don't care if it ends up in the hands of any person, it brings no value to anyone in particular because it brings everyone else the same value. Then, the message ceases to be personal because it means that nobody feels special after reading it.",8246,1496,1

1576672782.0,unpopularopinion,"If your child asks for birth control, for the love of god please give it to them.A pretty obvious opinion, but rather unpopular where I’m from in the Midwest. I’m thankful that my mother told me that if I ever needed birth control, she would get it to me. That was 7 years ago when I was 13. Now I’m 20, in a long term relationship, and have been on birth control since 17. Might not like some of the side effects I’ve seen (acne, bloating, slight weight gain etc.) But at least I don’t have a child.   

Both of my two girl friends from high school were not allowed to be on any form of birth control. One had to get it through college, one didn’t have an option till post graduation. 

My point is, you are not going to prevent your kid from having sex by keeping birth control from them. If you as a parent truly think that, you are delusional. Teenagers/young adults will always find a way to do what they want, and their parents telling them ‘no’ is just going to make them want to do it more. 

And this doesn’t just go for girls, I’m only writing it this way because I am a girl, and I know firsthand. Give your son condoms if he needs them, and educate both your sons and daughters about being safe. 

EDIT: Took a nap and came back to all of this. Just wanted to point out a few things as I’ve been scrolling through the comments. 

1. Yes, I am well aware the female birth control does have long term side effects. I’m also aware that it’s trial and error. I’m on my 3rd type of birth control and I’ve never been happier. It’s hard to discover what really works for you and that’s why it’s so important to see a doctor and not order pills online like they have available now. 

2. I’m well aware that female birth control doesn’t protect against STIs. But here’s the thing, condoms don’t protect against babies either. Doubling up on both female birth control AND condoms is a great way to prevent both a baby and STIs. 

3. Some are talking about fertility and birth control. It is known that the birth control shot CAN increase your risk of infertility a bit more than most birth control. But let’s think of other things that can affect fertility. Smoking, extreme weight loss, other types of hormones such as things we put in food, endometriosis. I could go on.

4. Rape happens. If you’re on birth control, chances are you’re not going to get pregnant.

5. Women can do whatever they want with their bodies. 

6. 20 y/o female living in Ohio, grew up catholic. For all you saying religion is the answer.

7. This is definitely leaning more towards girls on the pill, instead of boys with condoms. If you are calling your FEMALE child a whore, slut or anything of the sort, there is something wrong with you. Women can have sex. WOMEN CAN HAVE SEX.

8. How could I forget something so important? BIRTH CONTROL IS USED FOR SO MANY OTHER THINGS.

I agree it's important, but it's nothing you need a parade for.  There are waaaay bigger issues that get very little traction, such as the number of people living in poverty, even in the most developed nations.  Why is that?  Is it that the issues that affect huge percentages are too difficult to address?  Is it that no one in Hollywood is poor, but a disproportionate number are gay, so there is no platform for poverty?  Is the feeling that poverty is a choice?  Why don't we have parades for teachers or people who are working to better the world for much larger percentages of the population?

Disclaimer - I know it's been a long, hard fight for basic human dignity for homosexual people.

1556268625.0,unpopularopinion,"Telling people who have severe facial deformities that they're beautiful is disingenuous, patronizing, dishonest, and self-congratulatory.There's a youtuber named Nikki Lilly who does music and makeup videos on youtube. She looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/HqmUQng.jpg).

If you go to the comments section of any of her videos, you see hundreds or thousands of comments that are telling her how beautiful she is. There are rarely any other kind of comments as far as I can tell.

Now, this kind of strikes me as similar to telling an overweight woman that she is skinny. By no societal standards in the world that I can imagine would this girl be considered physically beautiful. She has a condition that causes her to have a severe and grotesque deformity on half of her face. She doesn't deserve to be bullied for this, of course. But I think the millions of fans she has and these thousands of comments are no coincidence. I think her appearance is the reason for her popularity, and so people view her as a freakshow, just of a different kind. People flock to her to her channel since they see her as a freakshow, but they just leave patronizing comments telling her how beautiful she is so they and everyone who upvotes them can feel good about themselves.

I see this as extremely strange behavior. It's almost as if Nikki is some sort of ""moral well"" from which people can draw in order to feel good about themselves and others, to have an unspoken, massive communal back-patting party in the comments about how good they all are as people. Her videos have thousands or tens of thousands of comments. People know the creator of the video will probably not see the comments, however they *do* know that other people will. That's why they leave these comments.

This is a bizarre new kind of phenomenon, and while I'm always happy for a fellow youtuber getting attention on their channel, I don't think this is a good kind of attention. I think it's actually a very disingenuous and off-putting kind of trend. It leaves me feeling very dirty and confused about the nature of social media.

It wouldn't be so bad if the comments were just normal, mildly supportive or even constructive comments, but these comments are really exaggerated. All caps, dozens of heart emojis, lots of exclamation points. It's almost as if they're trying to one-up each other for who can be the most overwhelmingly supportive and saccharine with their comments. It's actually kind of disgusting. I don't even know if we have words for this kind of behavior, since this is kind of a new phenomenon.

Really, I just feel sorry for this girl. I wonder if she understands what's going on.

EDIT: There are a lot of people talking about the subjective quality of beauty. In case it's unclear, I'm talking about the physical attractiveness of someone's face, which has a [basis in science](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/social-instincts/201507/what-facial-features-do-men-really-find-attractive?collection=1077685). I understand that beauty as a poetic concept does indeed have a high degree of subjectivity, but that's not what I'm talking about. Remember that Nikki is primarily a makeup/beauty vlogger, so comments about her being beautiful are likely referring to her appearance.

But in my personal experience and talk with my successful with women male friends women are quite likely to be bad and selfish in bed.  I don’t sleep with men so I don’t have a clue about men but a sizeable minority of women exhibit almost all of these traits:

- doesn’t move and is only a passive recipient of pleasure 
- foreplay is only for her never for you 
- frozen hands never move or stimulate partner 
- unnatural revulsion at seminal fluid 
-  always wants to be on bottom
- rarely initiate
- lack enthusiasm 
-  thinks penetrative sex must be so good for men that it’s all they need to offer in bed to be great
- unwilling to discuss it and/or super defensive and projecting if their partner brings it up

1600707236.0,unpopularopinion,"Forcing children to change in front of each other for gym is sexually abusive and this is a hill I will die on.When I was in middle and high school, one of the greatest sources of trauma I have ever endured was being forced to change in front of the other girls in locker rooms. They would make fun of my body relentlessly throughout that entire time. Not only was I the nerdy kid, but I basically had the body of a 11 year old until I was 16 and went through a major growth spurt where I went from completely flat chested to 32DD in the span of a single summer. So, my gym experience went from being made fun of for having a child's body to being accused of ""getting implants"" and further ridiculed the rest of my school life. Because it was solely my word against that of 8 other girls, the administration did nothing to stop it, even though the rumors spread like wildfire throughout the entire school. It's worth mentioning that i was extremely embarrassed by how fast my breasts grew, so I wore extreme baggy shirts to try to hide them. However, those attempts to hide them were moot thanks to the locker room before gym.

The worst incident crossed the line into full blown sexual assault. Four of the more popular girls circled around me and violently poked and squeezed my breasts, to the point where it was incredibly painful and they hurt for several days. It was some weird test to see if they were real or implants.

I was molested by a male adult as a 7 year old child and, to be completely honest, the abuse I suffered from my peers that i just described was every bit as traumatizing as that. In a way, it was even worse because there was no escaping it. At least when I told my parents about the abuse from the adult, it was dealt with and I never had to see him again. With the abuse from my peers, I had to suffer for years. 

Some of you might argue ""that was an especially shitty crop of girls, not every locker room experience is like that"". Yeah, but a) the administration didn't believe me because it was my word against everyone else's so I had to go through this shit for SIX FUCKING YEARS despite making literally 8 different complaints. b) quite frankly, it shouldn't take a seriously traumatic scenario to justify the idea that CHILDREN SHOULDN'T HAVE TO STRIP IN FRONT OF PEOPLE UNNECESARRILY WHEN THEY'RE NOT COMFORTABLE. c) if you think locker rooms abuse is rare, you are living under a rock.

Honestly, I gotta say- I genuinely don't see how anyone, besides pedophiles getting off on it, could stand by the idea that we should continue to systemically force children to strip in front of each other.

Person 1, elated with themselves, smugly ridicules person 2 and calls them fragile to shut them down. Person 2 wants to respond, but if they defend themselves, person 1 will claim this is proof of their fragility. If they don't reply, person 1 will claim they've won the argument.

This is such a cheap way of scoring meaningless points. Nothing is gained here. No meaningful discussion is had, no views are changed. If anything, all that happens is person 2 ends up with a stronger negative attitude towards people who align themselves with person 1's views, increasing polarisation.

1590086366.0,unpopularopinion,"Society IS hypersexualised, and I feel scared for the kids growing up with it.Let me start by saying that I'm 17. This is coming from a place of serious concern. I'm not some boomer trying to rag on the new generation because I have nothing better to do.

Everything is so unnecessarily sexualised these days. Adverts for the most banal products, music, random sex scenes in movies that could have been marketed to younger audiences without them, you name it: there's a naked girl or a weird moaning noise or an obvious innuendo. It's kind of sickening.

A lot of people argue that ""it's not over-sexualisation, it's sexual liberation!"" That this phenomenon is taking motion because people (mostly women, whose ability to do it has been hampered for centuries) are feeling more comfortable in their bodies and with expressing their sexuality. And that's great! 

But we don't need it everywhere. Every second tweet coming across my timeline is someone oversharing on their sexual experiences for clout and every song and music video is geared towards some sort of sexual stimulation/release. Everything is just constantly screaming sex, sex, sex.

Now, here's where my concern comes in: if the Internet was made up solely of people who had a sharp grasp on reality and on themselves, this onslaught of sexual content wouldn't be nearly as worrying as it is. But that's not the case. Younger, much more impressionable kids are using the Internet nowadays, and it's bleeding into the content I see from them.

Take the biggest culprit as example: TikTok. What may seem to many of us as completely harmless because the constant wave of hypersexualised content has practically immunised us to its effects would terrify any mother, and I couldn't say I would blame it. Kids doing sexual POVs, inappropriate dances, and dressing the way that they do is all a cause of the fact that they see older people doing it, normalising it, and running with it. There have been countless times that I have seen videos of boys standing shirtless in their rooms lipsynching to sexual lyrics and girls dancing incredibly explicitly and then I click on their page and see that they're 13, 14, 15, or 16.

That is horrifying to me. It's basically a new wave of paedophile fodder, and it's the fault of society's hypersexualisation.

I'm not here to pearl clutch and say that sexual expression should not be allowed or something. Of course not; everybody should be able to do exactly what they want to do. But we have to be extremely conscious of the people that are seeing our content, however fleetingly, and censor ourselves for their safety. I'm also not here to say that wearing certain clothes somehow constitutes immediate sexual intentions from other people: but you have to admit that nonces are more likely to go for children they see as ""easy"" and therefore vulnerable. That's why I'm so fucking scared for them.

So take it however you will. Lots of cool and differing opinions in here and I’ve enjoyed reading them. Thanks for participating you guys 💕

(**Original post below here**)

have a feeling this is going to be an unpopular post, because regarding the [recent news](https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/1195123215657508867) about Taylor's record label dispute, reddit has been overwhelmingly in support of her.

Taylor Swift is always playing the victim. Almost all of her songs are about how some boy came along and broke her heart, and how tragic that is because she was a perfect angel girlfriend and he was the absolute devil.

Example. She put [Joe Jonas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amh859mNeKI) on blast over their breakup. Told everyone on Ellen that he broke up with her in a 20 second phone call. But Joe Jonas came out and said that the only reason the phone call was so short was because *she* hung up on him.

Ok, but she was only 19 with this happened. Surely she's grown and changed as a person since then?

Nope. I'm not gonna link sources because you can find them easily on google, but she continues to have relationships like this. They end bitterly and she writes a song or makes a snarky public comment about how awful her ex is. Examples:  John Mayer, Calvin Harris, Harry Styles, Jake Gyllenhaal.

Look at her feuds with other celebrities. Kanye and Katy Perry are kind of insane, but she's fought with many others: Rihanna, Miley Cyrus, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, the list goes on.

Look at how she defends herself in all of these situations. She has literally told lies (ex: the kanye west debate and the joe jonas thing) to paint a better portrait of her as the victim.

And didn't she lie about her masters situation when the news first broke, too? Didn't it come out that Taylor did know about the deal and did have the opportunity to buy her masters, but she passed it up?? It seems she had the power to stop this from ever happening in the first place.

Now she's posting some pretty big accusations of him publicly, but she has nothing to back up her claims. She is literally asking her fans to brigade someone and have blind faith that what she's saying about him is completely true.

It definitely could be true. And I do feel bad for her if that's the case.

But she's a 30 year old grown ass woman. Worth half a billion dollars. She could afford the best attorneys in the world to take this guy down. But she decides to vent on twitter and ask her teenage fans to attack someone based on her word alone (which has historically been unreliable). I get that people think this is an important message to spread. But the way she worded it sure seemed like it wasn't about spreading awareness so much as it was about getting revenge.

Taylor Swift reminds me of a high schooler. Her ""squad"" is a clique and she is their Regina George. She has a pattern of unstable relationships and an inability to see her own flaws in them.

Edit 4: Yes, the teens are responsible for their actions. But if a teen comes to you and asks for bc then they are trying to be responsible.

My first assumption when someone is proud of their race is that they haven’t done anything with their life so they have to latch onto the success of other people who look like them.

Edit: A couple of comments have suggested that this means you also shouldn’t be proud of your family. That doesn’t apply because you had a direct impact on your family as they did with you. This extends to your community. What I am speaking of is hundreds of generations before you. 

Another point I’d like to make is if you agree that people shouldn’t be ashamed of what their ancestors did then by symmetry they shouldn’t be proud either. Current Mongols don’t need to feel ashamed of Ghengis Khan. I don’t think modern Germans should be held responsible for Hitler. That also means they shouldn’t get credit for the great things their ancestors have done either.

Due to me always being super aware of who made me comfortable I just never felt at ease enough to cross that boundary with any of my past relationships. It’s honestly weird when people are grossed out by the fact that I’m not interested in casual sex. 

I have a guy friend who’s celibate but his friend group bullied him, called him (gay slurs) until he caved in to the peer pressure. He wasn’t the same after that and I can tell he feels bad about breaking that promise to himself. There’s nothing wrong with sex it’s your choice. I just don’t understand why being a virgin especially as an adult or waiting is  “weird”.

I also work for a major insurer and know that fertility treatments are driving up everyone else's premiums because they're considered necessary care. Sorry, but I disagree.



It's a well known fact that there are over 400,000 children in foster care, and in 2017 alone over 100,000 infants under 3 entered the system.

1612726742.0,unpopularopinion,"Men who wish men got complimented more often should start a culture change by complimenting other men instead of expecting women to do itIn my few years on Reddit, I can't begin to count the times I've seen posts where men say how rarely they get complimented and how much they like it.  They write how much their self-esteem suffers because they never get complimented on their physical appearance. It's either bluntly stated or at least implied that women are lucky because we get complimented more.

Here's the thing though, at least my my own personal experiences and that of my female friends and coworkers over the years:  Women usually prefer compliments from other women more than ones from men (unless of course they already have a relationship with that man).  When a man compliments you, you don't know if he did so with any expectations.  It can awkward as F if a male coworker says you look good, and can sometimes make all future interactions with them uncomfortable.  Maybe this is unfair, but every woman I know well enough to have serious talks with has had experiences where they or someone they know had compliments turn into harassment.  When female coworkers compliment each other though, the (presumed) lack of any romantic subtext makes it much friendlier and positive.  And since we like getting compliments from women, we therefore compliment other women.  If my husband and I go over to a friend's house, I'll tell her that her hair looks amazing.  When a coworker comes to work in a new dress, I'll tell her it looks great on her.  And no, I'm not going to compliment a male coworker in the same way.  I might say ""I like that colour"" or ""New suit?  It's nice!"" or something similar to the guys I'm friends with, but that's about it.  It's not my or any other random woman's responsibility to compliment you just because you need it to boost your self esteem.

If you think men don't get enough compliments, start complimenting other guys.  Maybe it will start a culture shift in your environment that results in you getting the compliments you want.  If you think that it would be awkward, then you're acknowledging that compliments to or from people of the opposite gender have romantic or sexual subtexts- why else would you find it awkward to tell a male coworker he looks great in a certain outfit or with a certain haircut?

ETA- first of all, thanks so much for all the awards!  

2- For the guys who say they already do this- that's awesome and I hope I don't come across as condescending!

3- For the ones who say they can't do this without being seen as gay, well, a) that's not an insult, and b) the guys in point 2 prove that it's not always true.

There are certain situations where the other guy could be a longtime friend, or be with another person, or just have no interest in that sense, and it doesn’t mean that being overly jealous is a healthy behavior. What it is about is if a guy suddenly comes into the girls life and is very flirty, always demeans the boyfriend on the littlest things in hopes to cause a fight, and is overly nice and affectionate to the point it’s weird and if it’s at that point that “friend” is not trying to just be friends.

1599413356.0,unpopularopinion,"I wish there were more movies where the protagonists lost.I love watching movies, especially with friends. We go out and enjoy new movies and talk about stuff and just overall have a great time, but over the last few years I have been thinking about what movies were the most memorable to me. 

(Potential Spoilers Ahead) Some of the movies I found most memorable are movies like No Country For Old Men, Avengers Infinity War, Se7en, Fight Club, Hannibal etc etc. These movies are all super memorable to me not only because they're good movies but because they break free from the trend of invincible protags that you know are going to win in the end. Now movies where the hero wins are not inherently bad or anything, I just feel like a lot of them lose at least a small bit of their tension because of it. When I watch an action thriller I want to really worry for the heroes, I want to be attached to them and sit at the edge of my seat because I'm not really sure if they will actually make it out alive.

 I find myself getting invested much much more often when uncertainty is part of the movie. I want to worry. I want my heart to race. I want to cry. I want to get mad. I believe that if a movie is capable of making you feel true emotion, it succeeded in what it set out to do. If you cry at the end of a movie you were most certainly invested in the story, and right now I feel like many studios are just too afraid to break the mold in that way. I can understand, I mean money is on the line and lots of it at that. It is definitely a gamble to try to ignore the standard movie structure because many people are so used to it that if a movie doesn't follow that structure, it can feel off or confusing to the viewers, but those movies that do successfully break free of it are often very very memorable because of it.

TLDR: Movies that break the mold and try something unique adds uncertainty to the movie. That uncertainty causes the viewer to become invested in the movie as they never truly know what could happen in the end. If you think the protagonist truly could die or lose, you feel the same emotions they do, and if a movie is able to get you to feel emotion it definitely succeeded in my opinion.",2219,428,1

And someone said the adoption cost is ~30,000$ like wtf!
Your country needs to figure out some shit for that man. This cost is an average cost to raise a child for 10 years fulfilling his basic needs and school fees in my country man!

1601573503.0,unpopularopinion,"Americans vastly underestimate the number of actors who take steroids for roles, and youtube fitness culture is lying through its teethYou can get an amazing body naturally. But you can't do it in 6 months. These actors going on talk shows saying they gained 25 pounds in 5 months by eating chicken rice and broccoli sets unbelievably unrealistic expectations. People hear this and think they can do it too, and when they gain about 6 pounds of muscle in 5 months they get discouraged and give up. The open secret of steroid use in the film industry is turning people away from fitness and setting unachievable standards.

EDIT: There seem to be a lot of comments stating this is possible with personal chefs and trainers. It isn’t. This is the lie Hollywood has decided to offer up to the public about why they can’t get their results. They can’t exactly say they took steroids can they? Maximizing muscle growth takes a lot less than you might think. About an hour a day of focused lifting and eating in a slight surplus. They feed us this lie though because most of us can’t afford trainers and chefs, so it’s somewhat believable.

Think about it, plebs. 

No average human can fit a full hard taco shell into their mouths, which mean close to half the bites are just chips and toppings- not to mention that’s only IF you get at least halfway through the taco without it crumbling into a sad Mexican shame salad in the wrapper. Am I supposed to funnel into my mouth like a freaking savage? Or do I get up off the couch(which I was too lazy to leave to get the dang tacos in the first place) to get a bowl or plate to hold  so I can eat it like nachos without embarrassing myself or spilling it. At least with a soft taco I have a CHANCE to get an equal amount of fillings in one bite. 

Why? 
Just why? 



JUST WHY?!

Edit: some things to mention:
1- I see you haters saying it’s not an unpopular opinion but I read you, and you’re wrong.
2- as much as I would love to hand form a hard tortilla, wrap it in a soft taco, toast the shells in the oven, or otherwise doctor this taco, I’m exhausted as HELL and that’s why I ordered freaking Taco Bell in the first place. Don’t gutter palette shame me, guys- a bitch is tired and nothing good is close or open

3- it’s unreal the amount of people that think I’m just a messy eater. If I was a messy eater, then the fact that the tacos make a mess wouldn’t bother me- instead it’s really hard to eat messy food holding a baby, which is how I eat 90% of my meals.",1625,320,1
1592020133.0,unpopularopinion,"Society should run in shifts so that people who are naturally night owls can go about their lives comfortably, not just the morning people. This would actually benefit the world in several ways.I’ve read that in early hunter-gatherer civilizations, people would work & sleep in shifts. Some were awake during the day, some at night, and some in between. This was to ensure the safety of the group, and likely to maximize productivity as well. This seems to be why humans have evolved to be either “morning larks” or “night owls”. 

Since these traits still exist in humans, our societies should reflect this. Many people I know are total night owls, and find it very difficult to get out of bed & function at the hours that society demands. Yet they are full of creativity, energy & drive at night, firing on all cylinders & getting some fantastic work done. I believe that if society were to operate in shifts, many of these types of people would choose to work at night & sleep in during the day. There are some jobs that offer night shifts but there are not many, and there are basically no options for dining/shopping/activities/etc late at night. 

If this system was put into place, of course it wouldn’t be binding. You would be allowed to switch between working during the day or during the night, or somewhere in between, you’d just have to work it out with your employer. I believe this would also lower the crime rate, as those who choose to commit crimes in the nearly empty & quiet streets of nighttime would find it a lot harder to go unnoticed. 

I’ve considered the potential costs of businesses staying open 24/7, and while I haven’t really calculated the specifics on this one yet (someone smarter than me can chime in on this in the comments) I think it could work. Not every business would be obligated to stay open 24/7, but I believe that employers will be able to find many night-inclined people who would choose to work odd hours if given the option over waking up at the ass crack of dawn. There could be “day divisions” and “night divisions” of companies, which would be able to work parallel to each other & collaborate through meetings at in-between times that can work for all. 

There are other interpersonal factors that I haven’t quite worked out (what if a day person falls in love with a night person? What about schools, should they offer this option too? What would this do to families?) because honestly this is just a hypothetical system I thought of while moaning about how I really really don’t want to wake up early tomorrow. But I do see many potential benefits if all the details are ironed out correctly. Again, if anyone smarter than me is reading this and wants to give their take on this system’s economic/interpersonal/political impacts, I’d love to hear it.

Maybe the nighttime world wouldn’t be quite as active as the daytime one, but it would be a lot more active than it is now. And maybe, through giving people the chance to work & live in a way that is best suited for their individual biology, societies will be able to increase productivity as well as overall quality of life.

I would eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches a lot, or bring nut based products to school. I did this for my entire school life. If a kid had an allergy, they dealt with it, or they didn't go to my school.

Fast forward to me being a dad and sending my kid to school, camp, daycare, etc.

No products with nuts are allowed because some kid might have an allergy. WTF? This became a thing that we were inconveniencing the majority because someone *might* have an allergy. And with nuts, the allergy levels are from nothing to almost death. If a nut is going to kill you, you definitely shouldn't be out in public because eventually, you are going to get hit with some nuts.

Then there are certain years where someone might have a specific allergy and the class teacher will send a letter home saying the kids aren't to have any of THAT product in the food they bring to school.

Some letters home over the years had: shrimp, peaches, and fish. I am sure there were a couple more, but I can't remember them. I'm not saying I would send my kid to school with shrimp or fish, but peaches? When they are in season, why wouldn't I? Or maybe she might have a fruit salad thing...nope, can't do it, the teacher will confiscate it, and call me on it, and I look like the dick.

I get accessibility and all that, but your allergies shouldn't be my problem, and do you know how hard it is to pack up a lunch for your kid (or for yourself even) when your whole life is based on foods that someone *might* be allergic to?

I remember spending HOURS of my time finding snacks for my kid to take to school that had absolutely no nuts, but was still healthy. I'm sorry, I'm not sending her with fruit rollups and other sugary shit. Nuts are actually a really healthy snack, and really kid friendly.

Finally, are you parents with kids with allergies going to pay for all the parents of the kids that have to buy alternative foods to what they normally would send their kid to school with? I doubt it, so why make YOUR problem into OUR problem?

The savoury taste of mayo goes perfectly with the sweet hot chocolate. It has an added benefit of not triggering any lactose intolerances. 

For anyone wondering, the only way to make watered down mayo without it being just a bunch of globules of mayo. You have to put the mayo in a food processor and slowly add water, essentially emulsifying it with the water.

Edit: From the thousands of replies that I've gotten, I've learnt many things. 

1. There's something called Viennese Hot Chocolate which uses egg yolk in the drink to make it thick, and uses the same emulsifying technique that I use. 

2. Mayo is a common ingredient in chocolate cakes and brownies. Major names like Portillo's swear by it for their chocolate cakes. 

3. Oil is a great emulsifying agent. 

4. Acidity(mayo has vinegar) is a great addition to chocolate.

Edit 2: I can't keep up with all the recipe demands so I'm just gonna post it here. 

Nearly equal parts of mayo and water, a little less water than mayo. Water has to be hot, but not boiling hot or the mayo turns into a bunch of globules. 

You start blending the mayo in a food processor/blender and start adding the water slowly, and once you've emulsified all the water, add your preferred hot chocolate mix(mine is Cadbury).

You don't even need to post something hateful or offensive. Just disagree with the general opinion on a thread filled with only positives about something, without being rude or hateful or sarcastic, you'll be downvoted.

I am currently pregnant and on a parent forum where so many parents post about not knowing if they would do the early genetic screening and it's followed by even more parents saying it would matter what the results are they wouldn't do anything about it. 

Life is hard. Life as a special needs parent is even harder. I've lived both ways and I hate the naivety and toxic positivity that dwells among these communities.

I hate that my son was born with his issues. It has taken a toll on every aspect in my life. There is no real specials needs child care. The amount of procedures, doctors appointments, surgeries, extensive therapies, equipment is ungodly expensive and exhuasting. He suffers in ways that I can't do anything about. My relationship has gravely suffered, we never get to spend time without him and when we do it's brief.

This post specifically highlights the hardships I face. Which is relevant to the point I'm making. It doesn't mean I don't love my son. Loving him and treating him well is not mutually exclusive to the struggles his disorder causes myself and my family. 

Being honest and candid about how hard it is instead of fairy taling myself as some noble hero and smiling my way through it all allows a space for other parents or be able to feel safe in their own challenges.

I don’t make bank, I don’t go on crazy vacations, and I don’t have a variegated monstera. 

But I feel so honored to have everything I have and I don’t care if people think I’m lazy for not going after more. I’ve had people comment that “this is a cute starter house.” and it sounds like what I have is not good enough.

With the vanilla flavor, however, the whole soda gets creamier, smoother, with a flavor you can notice and a sweet after-taste reminiscent of buttercream frosting. The whole drink gets less harsh to swallow, not to mention that vanilla and whatever the base flavor is *work*. Like, really well.

In fact, they work together *so* well that the combination could be it's own soda, because it has it's own taste, unlike cherry or orange Coke (which just taste like regular Coke with fruits shoved in them).  

The only real downfall to vanilla Coke is that it's not wide-spread; only two stores in my town sell it, which is a huge shame considering how much of a blessing vanilla Coke is.

1616060007.0,unpopularopinion,"There is a massive disconnect in most relationships specifically because men are taught how to treat a woman as they grow up, but women are not taught how to treat a man.***This has gained some traction so I feel it is time fore some cleaning up, and clarification. The original post will remain at the bottom***

1. If you are using this thread to hate on women or think that is the point of this post you can kindly piss off. That is sad and embarrassing.

2. This post is about the disconnect of the majority of girls growing up without having many sources of information on how to communicate intimately with men in a relationship. Is this 100% true? Obviously not.... However, think back for at least a decade though and lets take a look at television specifically. This is also directly correlated with male fragility and how tv shows portrayed men and how they should act to ""be manly, be attractive, or have some value in a relationship."" The majority of the time ""romantic"" storylines are written about boys falling head over heels for some girl and then doing everything in their power to make things work. The most inclusive thing I've ever seen for female characters is the typical ""I like this boy but I don't know what to do."" and the obligatory ""Just be yourself and if he likes you It'll work out.""

3. The subservient topic and the early 1900s. Yeah, that was a time where women were basically house slaves made to serve men. That was terrible and not how relationships should work. Women were treated as objects and told what to do. Thing is folks, this post isn't about that. Trying to justify an overwhelming majority of women not knowing how to communicate intimately with a man by bringing up a subservient lifestyle of the past is just blatantly avoiding the point. I DO NOT WANT WOMEN TO SERVE MEN. What I am focusing on is what resources do most girls have growing up that teaches them to discuss a mans feelings and emotions? 

4. In case you are trying to make this a blame woman post you are completely wrong. The majority of this issue is derived from men protecting their status over the years. For a long time the media industry was dominated by males due to heavy sexist views from the past. Dear god has anyone seen a western before 1990. I'm just saying it would be cool to have movies or tv shows that can teach WOMEN AND MEN that men can be fragile and can cry, and get butterflies and flirt. We are barely scratching the surface of this and I think its awesome but we have a long way to go.

5. If you feel the need to argue this post try using the better argument that we need more shows and movies and media to teach men how to not be pieces of shit when acting towards women. We are still in that zone where men are written so poorly most of the time its a bit cringe to see how these scenes play out. Hell, half the time the shitty guy ends up with a girl anyways so some poor boys will think that it will actually work.

6. I'm getting a lot of messages about women being brought up to believe they need to ""please men"". That's exactly what I am talking about being the issue. That's a shitty mindset made by people of the past that's slowly fading out. It would be cool if it could change even faster.

7. I thought it would be fun to mention and with her permission I wanted others to know my girlfriend helped me make this post. While she doesn't agree 100% we have had discussions about this and her favorite example is hallmark movies. I didn't even consider that but she grew up watching hallmark movies and those things are just toxic examples of any relationship. Yeah in the end its all happy but really look at what happened to get that point. Get in one argument and leave your husband to marry a guy you lead on years ago from your home town you thought you'd never see again.

8. I'm going to add this again for all the hate mail I am getting. To the ladies out there talking about how they were raised to serve men. That is the problem. That is wrong. That does not teach women how to address men's feelings or emotions. It is a horrible ideology that needs to be eliminated. Everyone saying ""I wAs RaIsEd bEinG ToLd tO SeRvE MeN sO YoU ArE WrOnG"" are actually backing up my argument that there is very little taught on how to converse about men's emotions or feelings. You are agreeing with me that the teachings are shit and need to be changed. I don't get it, why does everyone feel like this was a personal attack.

Most young boys get advice from their parents on how women should be treated as they get older. However it doesn’t stop there for the boys. In social media, tv shows, advertisements, children shows, movies, even video games. Boys are shown many many ways to treat a woman in a relationship. Not all of these are good ways I might add. Regardless there is a steady stream of influential content that will shape a boy into making decisions on how to treat women. 

On the other hand, what is taught to young girls about how to treat a man when they get older? What source of media or family member is letting girls know how to talk to men. How to communicate with them. Almost every source for young girls focuses on vanity and self worth. Always setting a bar and rules that have to be met. It’s always about self rising up, and nobody else deserves your time unless you decide they are special. This is why most men will find affection in anything a girl does for them. It feels unique because women aren’t taught how to care for men so when they show kindness or affection without it being loving, it will always feel like so much more.",5613,1048,1

1612373325.0,unpopularopinion,"Kids in 2021 enjoy being outside just as much as kids in 1970. The problem ""these days"" is with parents, not kids.This seems to be an extremely unpopular opinion, because all I ever hear are adults bashing kids for ""not wanting to do anything but sit inside and play video games"" or ""all they do is stare at their phone"". Some of this may be true, but it's almost entirely the fault of parents. As a millennial, I only feel it fair to point out that our generation has largely failed our kids when it comes to being active and just generally being helicopter parents. I come from a decent sized family, live in a place where the weather is generally pleasant year round and know a lot of kids in my neighborhood due to being social with neighbors. Of all the kids I know, all of them love being outside. 


Here's the biggest difference: when we were kids, we went outside and played no matter what our parents were doing. If our parents were outside, we were outside. If our parents were inside watching tv, we were probably still outside. The only reason things ever changed from this formula, is because so many millennials are only open to letting their kids play outside if they can sit there and watch them the entire time. To make it worse, my generation seems extremely divided. People are either very active and bring their kids along, or they are complete home bodies who spend the vast majority of their time inside, subsequently keeping their kids cooped up inside the majority of the time with them.   


Of all the kids I know (which is a lot) the ones who have active parents love and appreciate the outdoors. The kids I know who's parents are home bodies are tons of fun and very active on the rare occasion that they get to go outside, but because their parents keep them inside most of the time they naturally take on things like video games and internet surfing. 


This opinion is not meant to argue reasons why or why not my generation lets their kids play outside. I am not saying people should feel comfortable letting their kids wander the streets for hours on end. That's a different debate. My opinion is simply that adults of all generations need to stop giving kids a hard time over being home bodies because it's not their fault, and many (if not all of them) would prefer to be outside most of the time.",2333,425,1

Of course there is nothing inherently wrong with traveling, but I disagree that people who travel a lot are automatically any less shallow than those who go clubbing or buy a lot of stuff. 

First of all, ""travel culture"" is a form of flexing. It has become less acceptable to brag about owning expensive stuff, so people now brag about their trips. Especially on Instagram, it is obvious that many use their travels to flex and show us how ""superior"" they are. 

""Traveling"" doesn't make you an enlightened intellectual in any way.

This means while an average drug dealer has bad influence on society and on their clients, if we compare individually ONE teacher and ONE drug dealer, it's debatable if having a bad influence on the education and professional life of hundreds of children is worse or not than selling drugs to a smaller fraction of the people. I think it is.

Furthermore, a child giving up school while young because of a teacher is way more likely to die young or to go to jail, or even to become a drug dealer, which is quite ironic here, because if a bad teacher caused only one dealer, he has had a worse influence than a dealer.

1655826361.0,unpopularopinion,"Any service you're legally required to purchase (like car insurance) needs to be offered by the government, not for profit.I feel like this should be common sense, but apparently not. If the government is telling people that they have to purchase a service, then they need to offer that service in a nonprofit capacity. Otherwise, they're essentially enabling an entire industry of private companies to extort people for profit under the threat of fines/revocation of privileges/jail.

I'm not necessarily saying that private, for-profit versions of the same type of service shouldn't be allowed to exist; they just can't be the only option when you're mandated to partake.

**EDITS TO ADD:**

**1)** A whole bunch of people are either misunderstanding my post or just not reading it. **I'm not saying that taxpayer money should be used to pay for car insurance.** Imagine the exact same structure we have now (drivers pay a premium based on their driving history, car type, etc) and receive whatever type of coverage they're paying for. The only difference would be that the service wouldn't be run for the express purpose of **trying to make money**; it would be run to break even and **give people the best value for money possible**.

**2)** Saying 'you aren't required to drive a car/it's not a right to drive a car' is just not a realistic statement in the USA. People often live in rural areas because they *can't afford* to leave in the city (close to their underpaying job) and don't have access to public transportation to get to work, therefore they need a car.

**3)** The 'look at all these bad government programs!' argument is getting repeated a bunch of times with **zero** evidence attached to the comments. Please start at least being constructive. I'll go first: there's a long and storied history of politicians (most of them belonging to a specific party which shall remain nameless) who systematically and intentionally underfund and mismanage public programs in order to provide 'evidence' they need to be privatized. The problem isn't government ownership of the program; it's greedy people in a position of power trying to exploit a system for their own gain. You'll get this in both public and private sector endeavors. With the government, at least we can try to hold them accountable via the democratic process; with private CEO types we have no real sway over them, especially when their service is something we're *required* to buy.

**SECOND, SALTY EDIT:**

Since all the diehard capitalist fanboys came out to play, I need to break something down for y'all. **Profit isn't the only incentive that exists for people to do good work.** Is every amateur videogame modder, music creator, artist, etc **only** creating what they do because they're secretly hoping to become filthy rich? The answer is a pretty obvious no. People can be driven for any number of reasons.

Secondly, the private market and the government are both comprised of *people*; they're not magically different from one another in their construction. The main difference is that private companies are in business, principally, to make as much money as possible (there are some few exceptions, but the bigger you get, the fewer there are). That means they're going to do whatever they can to squeeze you, the customer, for as much $$$ as possible, which translates into giving you the *least* service for the *most* cost that the market can bear. This arrangement only serves to benefit those who are already in a position of power and can realize the excess profit from this equation. The rest of us just get shafted.

1595260009.0,unpopularopinion,"Being able to say “I didn’t respond/didn’t answer your call because I just didn’t feel like it” should be normalized and people shouldn’t take it personally.It’s not uncommon to think of any excuse possible to get out of an unwanted conversation/phone call/meetup/etc. I personally have always been someone who feels the need to think of a perfect excuse as to not offend the other person. “Sorry I was working” when really, I was watching Netflix. “Oh sorry I missed your call! I don’t have good cell coverage where I am” etc.

However, saying something like “sorry I missed your call, I don’t feel like talking at the moment” is something that I know a lot of people would take personally. When I’ve responded like this to people, they also always assume something’s wrong, that I’m upset, angry at them, etc. when really I’m either just busy or not in the mood to talk to anyone cause I’m just doing my own thing.

**EDIT**: To the people saying, ""Don't give any explanation, just say ""sorry I missed your call"" and leave it at that."" My whole point is that sometimes, people will press to know why you were busy and why you missed their call or what you were doing. In this case, you should be able to say ""sorry, just didn't feel like talking to anyone!"" Even if you say ""Sorry I can't talk, I'm busy"" people will most likely try to call you back at a time when they think you won't be busy. So instead, you should just be able to say that you weren't in the mood to talk.

**EDIT 2:** To all the people saying, ""That's a rude way to put it"" I obviously wouldn't phrase it like how I did in the title lol. I wouldn't say ""Nah I don't feel like it.""

1575710258.0,unpopularopinion,"The American style of tipping is a toxic culture that should be abolishedNow, before I continue, I would like to say that I ain't American, but I have read about how tipping works there from reddit. Thus, according to Internet law, I'm an expert on the matter. (In all seriousness though, just correct me if I'm wrong)

- First of all, you guys say that tipping is necessary in order for workers to earn above minimum wage. However, isn't it a rule in most establishments that if the employee doesn't make enough through tips, their boss should cover the rest? What do you know, apparently untipped waiters aren't suffering from lack of cash. You might say that if tipping is abolished, the cost of food in restaurants will rise. So what? You are already paying extra through your bloody tips, just divert that cash to a higher price of a meal. Just make things a bit more simple. 

- Apparently, there is also cases of employers 'stealing' their workers tips or forcing them to 'share' it. Like how certain restaurants force their waiters to equally share their hard earned tips with their fellow workers. What the fuck is that? So if I work hard, treat my client extra super special awesome and received a glorious 50% percent tip for my hard work, I must share it with lazy Harry who sleeps in the storeroom every chance he get? And don't tell me that waiters have to share their tips with the cooks for the sake of 'fairness'. After all, don't cooks earn above the min wage? 

- Unlike most people apparently, I love maths. Damn, how I loved it, and I was pretty good at it. Nevertheless, it doesn't mean that I want to do a freaking mental calculation everytime I finish a meal. Like wtf people, I wanna chill after I finish dinner. And don't you people start giving me pointers on simple ways to calculate how much to tip a person. I find it twisted that tipping is so ingrained in American culture that you guys make a literal rule for it. Japanese student bow to their teachers respectfully before starting class, but any American asshole who gives below 20% for a tip is the scum of the earth and is a reserved a special VIP room in hell. 

- Plus, tipping culture apparently breeds a sense of entitlement among some in the service industry. I've read stories about waiters and waitresses who turn their nose away from what they presume is a 'low' tip and even 'subtly' hint that they should get a higher amount. Like bitch, you are literally getting money from someone whom isn't entitled to pay you squat and you got the audacity to be choosy about it. 

- Why only waiters get to be tipped? Why not the janitors, the maids or the garbage men? Some of them have even tougher jobs then waiters. They don't get tipped. I mean, when have you guys even said thank you to the guys who scrubbed your toilet bowl squeaky clean? Not to mention how some waiter may be lucky enough to earn double or triple above the minimum wage if they work at a particularly affluent restaurant. A bit unfair isn't it?

- I feel like the easiest way to solve this problem is for the American legislation to get amended so that the workers in the service industry get paid according to the minimum wage. So why are you all so stupid that you can't figure out this simple solution? 

- Now, I'm not saying that tipping is bad. However, it should be used to show appreciation rather than being something mandatory. Hell, some restaurants even include tipping in the bill as a gratuitous fee. How presumptuous is that? Crap, I'm straying of point. Anyway, like I was saying, tipping should be a choice on the customer's behalf, to pay for some particularly outstanding service from their waiter. It shouldn't be freaking corrupted by being made socially compulsory. 


You guys might be wondering why the hell I decided to post this. I don't live in America, nor do I plan to. This has nothing to do with me whatsoever, so why am I being a busybody? Well, it's because this annoys me. It's really, really annoying on how this whole issue is so stupid and unnecessarily overcomplicated. Of course, this ain't the only time America decided to be 'different' in order to separate themselves from the rest of the world only to end up looking like idiots. Remember the imperial system crap? Similarly, this whole issue is such a big pain in the ass for everybody that I internally cringe everytime I think about. So, I decided to vent about it by bashing the Americans. That's all.







Edit 1: Most of you talk about how tipping is a good thing because servers get more money than if they totally depend on min wage. That working as a server is so horrible that nobody will do it if not for the tips. Well, guess what? There are other shitty jobs out there and they don't get tipped for it so this seems pretty unfair to me. Basically, servers want this culture to stay, despite they getting less than minimum, because its better for them compared to the customers.

Edit 2: What's up with Europe and shitty service? You guys keep talking about how tipping incentives servers in America and you use your experience with Europe to prove that. This is not a thing in Southeast Asia, where I actually live, cuz people provide good service here WITHOUT EXPECTING TIPS. You Westerners are seriously dissapointing me here.

Edit 3: My god, you servers are salty af clinging to your precious tips just because you want to enjoy a lavish lifestyle that other minimum wage workers don't enjoy. You guys are a bunch of whiny entitled crybabies.

Edit 4: One thing I feel like I have to remind you guys is that I'm not hating on tipping. Instead I feel that we should only tip when we get great service, not average service. Unfortunately, though its purely voluntary, Americans are socially pressured to tip, even for shitty service. This is what I dislike.",5828,1046,1

For as long as I can remember being on this earth, but definitely since being 5 years old, I was and am passionate about cars. And even when my age still was in single digits, some people always thought it'd be a good idea to tell me that I'll lose interest in cars and all that stuff.

I have been the sole provider for most of this, with her staying home. But, for a period of about 2 1/2 years, I was the stay at home spouse. It was the best time of my life.

I was very self conscious about being a stay at home dad, so I went above and beyond to take care of the home and kids. It took about 2-3 hours per day for the first few weeks, then just maintaining what I had done was about 2 hours per day. I got to spend more time with my kids. It was great. 

My wife was putting in 10-12 hours each day between getting ready, commuting and working. You bet your sweet ass I made sure she didn't have to lift a finger when she got home. If she did anything to help, it was because she genuinely wanted to.

I'm not talking about spouses who are slobs, or just aren't engaging with their kids or partner. Certainly those are issues to be talked about. But complaining that they 'never' do the dishes? I would never expect them to.


Edit: So apparently a lot of people have a chip on their shoulder about who does more work in the relationship. And everyone has qualifiers and extreme examples that may or may not invalidate my post.

Frankly, I believe that dying of sickness or an accident when you're a young adult (20-35 years old more or less) is way out more brutal.

The child leaves almost nothing behind. It's terrible for the family, that's for sure, but at the same time that person hasn't brought anything to the world yet and most of children don't even know what's happening while they're dying.   On the other hand a young adult leaves friends, sometimes a companion or children. They had something to live for, absolute lucidity on the matter and a half fulfilled life that they will never be able to put a good ending to.

I don't mean to say that children deserve more to die than young adults, that's obvious, but generally speaking I think that the death of a person who already lived half a life and leaves it all behind  is way out sadder than just a kid that has no or very little conscience of what's happening and most of the time does not have something to live for other than the only fact of living.

In a world full of chaos, where everything you do affects your life and everything can change in a moment's notice, such as a car crash, cancer, job raise, job loss, kicked in the balls by random stranger, 1+1 will always equal 2. 45 degrees will always be half of 90, which will be half of 180 which will then be half of 360, making it a full circle, which is the center of the fibonacci sequence, which can be found in so many every day occurrences it is absolutely ridiculous. In a world of chaos, math is supreme, calculations will never change. Sure, maybe the US education system absolutely fucks over everyone's perception of math by making it insufferable. But what the teachers told us countless times is true, ""math is in every day life, and you may be using y=mx+b without even knowing it one day"". Maybe forcing us to learn advanced mathematics is what makes our perception of it so twisted, as does handing out sheets with 50 algebraic equations to solve at the start of class as a warmup for a new lesson when you just covered the subject of the 50 you're solving the day before. Math is extremely exciting, solving a complicated geometric problem and being able to confidently circle the right answer on a test is the absolute best feeling.

1604782625.0,unpopularopinion,"The steoreotype of ""student running on four hours of sleep and a package of instant ramen"" is not cool and damaging to student mental healthOkay. Please hear me out.

I am an 18 year old university student myself, and I have started to notice some patterns around me that really annoy me. One thing I absolutely hate is when people start to make competitions out of who has it worst. Who has the worst teacher? Who has to stay up the latest? You almost start to feel ashamed if you have a good teacher in a subject! And shame on you if you go to bed on time or wake up early. You are eating healthily as a student? Your study must be super easy! Lucky you!

What those people don't realize is that actually, you don't want to have to study 16 hours a day non-stop for every day. Yes, many claim they do cause it's cool, but most don't actually. Maybe they do work until 2 am, but you are not going to wake up again the next morning at 6 to continue your studies. And if you do run on 4 hours a sleep: that is not cool and nothing to show off with! It is super unhealthy for you, physically and mentally. So please, stop it. Promoting the stereotype of ""college student running on four hours of sleep and instant ramen"" and making a competition out of it is harmful for many.

Seriously, there are students all around the world who get mental breakdowns due to work overload. In some countries (I'm sorry for including a stereotype here but I'm going to say mostly in asian countries), students have so much pressure that they have increased rates of suicide and burn outs. In the ""western world"", making a competition out of who is the ""unhealthiest"" student staying up the latest is not good for anybody. Instead of doing so, people should be happy and thankful for  not being the case!!

(on another side note, I've noticed that

1. many of those who complain about staying up till 4am sleep till 11 am or later
2. many university students would have the money for ""healthier"" food if they spent less on alcohol

It's annoying and it's cringey. I mean they're either changing the lyrics of well known songs to fit the script, or they're singing songs that vaguely relate to what's going on in the show.

1598813414.0,unpopularopinion,"The dating world would be better if culture supported women asking men out more than men asking out women.The reason for this is that women are MORE SELECTIVE.

Think about it. Whenever there is a group of people deciding what to do, it's more efficient to have the most picky person decide, since their choice is most likely to be accepted by the other members. Otherwise everyone else has to work to find something the picky person will accept, and that's excess work.

Well that's EXACTLY what happens in the dating world. Women are more picky, but rather than take in upon themselves to decide who they want to date and act upon it, they more often expect the men to come to them, creating more work overall.

Let's use numbers to illustrate. Let's say (hypothetically) that a man will agree to date 20% of women, and women will agree to date 10% of men.

In this case, if a woman is looking to date, we would expect a match after she asks out 5 men she approves of.

If instead she makes the men do all the work, we would expect a match after 10 men ask her out.

Even a hybrid is more efficient than this. If the woman asks out 2 men, 6 men asking her out in addition are then required for there to be an expected match. That's 8 attempts, which is less than 10.

Clearly, in a world where women are more selective, allocating the work to men just complicates the process. Since women are the ones who have a narrower selection of potential mates, let them decide who they want, since they have a worse chance of being turned down.",1537,287,1

We're at the point where it doesn't really mater bc the graphics are so good. Game developers should try to focus on making their games smaller (storage wise) and getting them to require less powerful equipment. I and most other people don't want to or can't spend 5k+ on a gaming pc to experience their games at 4k 512 fps. I'd like to be able to play nice games on my laptop without it sounding like a plane or turning into a heater. And it's ridiculous that on a 500 Gb device I could have like 3 or 4 modern AAA games.

Edit: to everyone saying this isn't an unpopular opinion, please look at one of the several hundred comments calling me an idiot. To those calling me an idiot, this is my ***opinion*** based on what I, someone not in the industry, has seen and experienced. I'm saying that developers should focus less on graphics and more on optimization and building better stories or making their maps actually playable and not 90% inaccessible, or physics engines that work. There are other more important factors in a game than trying to achieve an unachievable dream of perfect graphics. 

And to everyone calling me a poor person, just- stop? I'm not and that wasn't the point of this post. You're just making yourself look like a dick biscuit.

Okay because apparently I have to explain this to some people like they're 5, good or bad graphics do not nessasarily mean other aspects are good or bad. But development has limited resources and I feel that if studios were to focus on other more important aspects of the games they make it would lead to a better game and experience. It doesn't matter how good your graphics are if everything else suffers from it. I got tired of playing AC Valhalla because I spent more time in loading screens than the actual game play.

I'm currently in a serious relationship and I've talked this through with my partner and he is ok with it and respects my boundaries. I am completely committed to the person I'm dating and I will only go to them for things that I deem exclusive to a romantic relationship, therefore I expect the same from them. When I masturbate I only masturbate to them and I expect the same. When I feel genuine romantic emotions, I only feel them toward them, and I expect the same. The reason being is that I am very, very serious about long term relationships and I'd feel like I was doing something very wrong if I thought of anyone else in this way.

If you've discussed it with your partner and you're both ok with porn, thats cool, but I've been pressured by multiple people in the past to act like I'm ok with it, but I just never have been. Porn is something I'm highly uncomfortable with, it makes me feel jealous and betrayed and it makes me feel like I'm not good enough.

Burgers are a finger food, the bun means that you can hold it but some of these things need deconstructing or to use a knife and fork. One of the few requirements for food is that it fits in your mouth, why not make it easier by making it shorter. If you want more, just have 2 normal burgers. Applies to other foods too. I would even go a step further and say I would love for all food to come in bite size pieces, but then I would probably be happy with a “one a day” food pill so....

Children need to learn to admire others instead of unjustly having their egos inflated by those around them who tell them they are geniuses, kings, queens, princesses, future Kobe Bryants.

It’s a little sloppy and I’m not like looking to “party” like that. I stop at maybe 2-3 drinks and I’m good. I don’t like putting alcohol in my body cuz of guilt too. However, socially EVERY outing involves drinking. Pool? Drink. Rooftop? Drink. Picnic? Champagne. Bar? Of course drink. 

Like I get slightly hungry after 11pm too, men should hit on women by sending them over something off the appetizer menu or a dessert plate instead. We’re out all night, liquid alcohol isn’t going to keep me standing. We need carbs. Thanks. I’m also wanting to hilariously point out that for those messaging me as a gold digger for wanting an alternative to alcohol, honey.. you have NO gold. (Imagine me making a post about a serious purchase like.. um a car or house). 

Edit: A lot of men here have probably never been in a social situation where they wanted to befriend an attractive girl at a bar and bought her a drink or two (generously offered) before. Otherwise you wouldn’t have your panties in a bunch over * *gasp* *such expensive appetizers :/ I feel bad for the ladies in your city who have to be subjected to such ridiculous behavior.

But all in all, thanks for some enthusiastic comments about treating a girl to some bar food if she doesn’t like drinking. It’s definitely a good starter and you can spend a bit more time with her. It’s also a tad harder to run away with a plate of wings.

Edit 2: Also to go deeper because ya’ll reallyyyy wanna go there. Even as far as to go and call women prostitutes for asking for appetizers instead. LOL. Some have pointed out that alcohol is preferred and that “beggars shouldn’t be choosers and just be grateful a drink was bought for you” because a guy has the advantage when a girl is drunk. So if you care if she’s a bit hungry or not, it doesn’t benefit the men trying to get laid that night. Because buying a complimentary drink is to not be nice. In fact food slows down how fast a girl can get drunk. So that’s why ya’ll are mad when women want the food alternative to alcohol. Alcohol is to inebriate women, wings don’t. It all makes sense now.

If I contended this in public, I'd get mowed down by angry reprimands and disappointed looks. But from an objective and statistical standpoint, it's nonsensical to give a flying fuck about school shootings. Here's why.

&#x200B;

**1,153.** That's how many people have been killed in school shootings since 1965, per [The Washington Post.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/mass-shootings-in-america/?utm_term=.094b0180ee3a) This averages out to approximately **23 deaths per year** attributable to school shootings. Below are some other contributing causes of death, measured in annual confirmed cases.

1. **68 - Terrorism.** Let's compare school shootings to my favorite source of wildly disproportionate panic: terrorism. Notorious for being emphatically overblown after 2001, terrorism claimed 68 deaths on United States soil in 2016. This is **three times as many** deaths as school shootings. [Source](https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death)
2. **3,885 - Falling.** Whether it be falling from a cliff, ladder, stairs, or building (unintentionally), falls claimed 3,885 US lives in 2011. The amount of fucks I give about these preventable deaths are equivalent to moons orbiting around Mercury. So why, considering a framework of logic and objectivity, should my newsfeed be dominated by events which claim **169 times less** lives than falling?   [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/06/deaths-mortality-rates-cause-death-2011)
3. **80,058 - Diabetes.** If you were to analyze relative media exposure of diabetes against school shootings, the latter would dominate by a considerable margin. Yet, despite diabetes claiming 80,000 more lives annually (**3480 : 1 ratio**), mainstream media remains fixated on overblowing the severity of school shootings. [Source](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2017/019.pdf)

&#x200B;

And, just for fun, here's some wildly unlikely shit that's **more likely to kill you** than being shot up in a school.

* **Airplane/Spacecraft Crash** \- 26 deaths
* **Drowning in the Bathtub** \- 29 deaths
* **Getting Struck by a Projectile** \- 33 deaths
* **Pedestrian Getting Nailed by a Lorry** \- 41 deaths
* **Accidentally Strangling Yourself -** 116 deaths

&#x200B;

Now, here's a [New York Times Article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/20/us/school-shootings-drills-risks.html) titled ""*New Reality for High School Students: Calculating the Risk of Getting Shot.*"" Complete with a picture of an injured student, this article insinuates that school shootings are common enough to warrant serious consideration. Why else would you need to calculate the risk of it occurring? What it conveniently leaves out, however, is the following (excerpt from the [Washington Post:](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/school-shootings-are-extraordinarily-rare-why-is-fear-of-them-driving-policy/2018/03/08/f4ead9f2-2247-11e8-94da-ebf9d112159c_story.html?utm_term=.c7e601c50733))

>That means the statistical likelihood of any given public school student being killed by a gun, in school, on any given day since 1999 was **roughly 1 in 614,000,000**. And since the 1990s, shootings at schools have been getting less common. The chance of a child being shot and killed in a public school is extraordinarily low.

&#x200B;

In percentages, the probability of a randomly-selected student getting shot tomorrow is 0.00000000016%. It's a number so remarkably small that every calculator I tried automatically expresses it in scientific notation. Thus the probability of a child getting murdered at school is, by all means and measures, inconsequential.

ORIGINAL POST

MSTOP TELLING ME ABOUT SENIOR RETIREMENT VILLAGES. I AM 34, NOT 50. I CANNOT MOVE INTO ONE FOR ANOTHER 16 YEARS. WE CANNOT AFFORD A HOUSE. WE’RE SAVING FOR ONE. WE HAVE REPORTED THE FAMILY TO THE LANDLORD AND CPS. 

My wife and I got some new upstairs neighbors recently. They were a bit loud moving in, but we figured that they were just trying to unpack as quickly as possible to get settled in. We brought them a basket of baked goods- and were promptly told by the lady of the house “I hope you guys are good with noise. We have 6 kids under the age of 8.” 

They’ve been here for a month. We have not slept for a month. They scream at one another all hours of the day and night, run and jump super loudly, and are just generally annoying. Evidently, they like the sound of our doorbell and will press it repeatedly to the point where we decided to take the batteries out. 

We’ve filed several noise complaints, only to be told “They’re kids. What do you expect?” Considering that we’re paying nearly $2000 in rent per month, we were expecting at least some peace and quiet. 

If there were an adults only apartment building with no children allowed, that would be amazing.

Edit to add: No one under the age of 18 would be allowed to move in. Should any resident get pregnant and decide to have the child, they will be moved to a child friendly complex owned by the same company. (Original wording was vague) It’s literally one building for people without kids, and one for people with them. They would have 3 months to vacate their current apartment and move into the child friendly block. 

This is a hypothetical situation. 

And yes, I know retirement communities exist. My wife and I are in our 30’s. We don’t qualify yet. We actually like kids- it’s the fact that kids are very poorly behaved now and we want to have at least *some* peace and quiet. For those of you with children, good for you- just raise them to be aware of the noise they make and try to shape them into respectful and kind little humans. 

Last edit: I can’t believe this tiny germ of an unpopular opinion managed to make it on the front page. Whether or not you agree, the point is moot. My wife and I have decided to spend the weekend at my parents house to get some space from our neighbors. The stress that we’ve been going through with these neighbors is intense. 

We’re planning to move out once our lease is up and will be looking into getting a top-floor unit. We live in America, so this child free building couldn’t exist here. I know that and I wanted to see if people were interested in something like that. We called CPS because we think the kids are being abused, not because of the noise. They show a lot of signs of neglect, despite the fact that the parents are home nearly all the time.

While I agree that finding other people attractive is just a part of being human it becomes concerning if you feel the need to continuesly tell your partner this. Obviously I don’t know how your relationship works so maybe you and your partner have a bond over talking about who you find attractive. However, if you are in a closed relationship with someone I don’t see what the point of telling them that you find someone else attractive is, just keep it to yourself. For example, if you see someone on the street and think they look cute why would you tell your partner about how cute they look? Or if you have a celebrity crush on an attractive celebrity, why won’t you just have that fantasy in your head, what will telling your partner who probably doesn’t compare to that celebrity do? 

There’s nothing they can really do with that information, to me it just seems like a way to try and get a reaction out of someone or to see if they’d get jealous or not. If you don’t get jealous by that stuff that’s great and shows that you are confident in yourself, however, if you do get jealous by this stuff there’s nothing wrong with you for doing so, they should keep their fantasies to themself. 

TL;DR - it’s 100% natural to find other people attractive in a relationship but feeling the need to continuously tell your partner who you find attractive is an asshole move.

1544873437.0,unpopularopinion,"There needs to be a small dick acceptance movement before I even begin to give a shit about Fat acceptance for women.Perhaps this isnt an unpopular opinion, but I'm a bi man who hasn't ever gotten with another man but I talk to gay men a lot. (I've never engaged with it for my own personal reasons but that's besides the point)

I don't think many women realize how fucking horrible it is for a man to have a small dick. How emasculating it is to be judged solely on something that you have absolutely no control over. My size isn't great either but I've come to accept it, however, I know many men who simply can't and most women and society at large do **nothing** to support a person with a small dick. 

When I see all the normal shit about fat acceptance or otherwise loving women no matter what size they are, I laugh because they can fucking *change* their size. A man can't. A woman can get larger breasts, a man can't increase his size. Why should I focus my energy on making those who can change their situation or otherwise in the case of fat people **put themselves in the situation to begin with** feel more comfortable about themselves while those who can't do **anything** to help their situation aren't even fucking mentioned in the mainstream until it's convenient.

The rise in hookup culture is only doing more harm. Many men can't stack up, what's considered ""average"" size is in many cases thought of as small. While it's taboo to shame a woman for their body, small dick jokes seem as if they are completely fair game and the hypocrisy is absolutely disgusting to me.

Edit: as an addendum, I'd like to also take the time to bitch about men with bigger dicks. 

All I can say is fuck most of you. You treat your smaller brothers like shit most of the time. Thinking you're fucking special or you did something to earn your sexual prowess, fuck off. It was luck of the God damn draw you should be getting on your knees and thanking whatever cosmic force responsible for bestowing your prowess unto you. While the rest of the population has to carefully disclose their size to every partner, wondering in the back of their mind if they *truly* don't care. Even though I accept my size (it's about 5 and a half inches) I know I could have it a lot worse and many men do. I still have it in the back of my mind that whoever I'm with isn't actually satisfied with my size like they say they are. I'm glad you fucks don't ever have to deal with that because I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy to be honest. 

**Edit 2: I would like to address some comments and common replies and also give a brief overview of my thoughts thus far.**

I didn't think this was going to blow up like it did. I'm glad it did to be honest because it really put some things in perspective for me. 

Firstly I'd like to address this ludicrous notion that I hate women. I dont know how I can prove to any of you that I dont hate women other than me saying I dont. I may have used harsh words but my words were not to disparage any one group just for existing. My problem was purely with the double standards, with the non-inclusion of men in the mainstream body positive movement. 

I understand and agree that fat acceptance is something we should be concerned about. No one *should* be made to feel horrible about themselves based on their body by other people. My main point was I believe we should be striving for an all inclusive body positive movement that encompasses everyone from burn victims to people with major deformaties, to men and women whom have insecurities. **I never said one couldn't have a fat positive movement.** (despite my disagreements with it due to the unhealthy side effects encouraging obesity can lead to but that's besides the point) I simply *longed for an all inclusive body positive movement* to be pushed just as much if not more than the fat acceptance movement. I get that caring about one thing within a movement doesnt necessarily negate your concern for other issues. But from where I'm sitting it doesnt seem like a lot of men get the same amount of support for their body issues by comparison of women. Perhaps that's just my confirmation bias, and if that's the case I apologize and acknowledge my fault. And before anyone addresses it, I'm not even necessarily advocating for a small dick movement despite the title. That was mostly just for flair and to discuss the notion of body positive movements not including men, and I used penis size as an example. What I really want is inclusivity. Of everyone. 

Another topic I'd like to address is the idea that ""women can't hide the fact that they're fat, men dont broadcast their dick size so it's not as much of a daily struggle by comparison of fat people."" While I understand the logic, I dont really see how its productive. Sexual relationships is a *huge* part of humanity as a whole. Many of us crave it, strive for it. Make it the focus of our daily lives in some cases whether we want to or not. When a person feels inadequate about themselves this can have **major** implications on a persons psyche. If left untreated it can have damaging effects on ones personality and mental state which ultimately harms them on the day to day. I understand that's not a healthy way to go about it, they should be seeking help themselves. But I feel many men are discouraged from talking about it, it's made out to be as if it doesn't matter. Which is why I'm encouraging an all inclusive body positive movement. But I feel the main point those who say this are trying to make is that there's more pressure put on society to accept ones outward appearance that is visible to the naked eye. And I agree with that, but all I'm really saying is we should be reaching higher. 

I obviously can't be the judge of my own character, but I believe I'm a bit of an idealist. For better or worse, I sincerely believe humanity coming together as a whole is not only possible, but necessary for humanity to advance in any meaningful way. Whether it was your intent or not, having a body positive movement that is pushed in the mainstream that is only really geared towards supporting one group can lead to feelings of neglect for another. 

Another topic that was brought up was about my abrasiveness. Many thought I was an asshole in my post and I would agree with that. I admit I'm a bit of a douchebag but that's why I dont want to be the one ""leading the charge"" so to speak. Many suggested that I should start the movement myself, but I'm simply not the right person for the job. I'm hot headed, I sometimes don't think before I speak and many people tend to vehemently disagree with my opinions. I'm a private person, despite how I am online with anonymity, in real life I am a bit of a hermit and have horrible anxiety when placed in uncomfortable positions. I also dont feel it would even be taken seriously given the replies. I see posts of people posting this post on other subs to bitch about it. ""r/unpopularopinion where white men go to whine about shit no one cares about."" I knew there would be opposition to this post and I was prepared for it, but some of the replies honestly make me feel like shit. Perhaps rightly so, because I'm a bit of a dick. But love me or hate me, I stand by most of what I said. 

I sincerely hope that if you take away anything from this, it's that we shouldnt be focusing on advancing one particular group. Supporting one particular group. (Culturally speaking I'm not talking about specific diseases or aggretious physical phenomena) I care about people despite what many of you may believe. And all I really want is peace and acceptance of everybody. (Aside from douchebags who think they're better than everyone else i.e in regards to the first edit about people who flaunt their bigger dicks)

The last major point I'd like to address is many people believe me to be insecure. Somehow me being insecure invalidates the very real lack of support for males in this department. I'll admit that sure, I wish I had a bigger dick. I feel a bit shitty about it at times but for the most part I can tolerate it. I've had partners who didn't care and I genuinely believe them. I know they're out there it's just a matter of finding them. So you can call me an insecure whiny little bitch all you want but you're only proving my point.  

One last thing is I really do appreciate the discussion. There are a lot of points I strongly disagree with that I didn't address here, and there are many ideas I really should think over and reevaluate myself. And I thank  everyone for giving me the opportunity.",8615,1577,1

""But 10 is a cool number and is essential for almost everything"" you might say. Absolute bollocks. I can write an essay about how bad 10 is but to keep it relatively short, the only reason 10 is considered special is because we follow the base 10 decimal number system. It has just this one thing going on for it. But guess what, base 10 is a horrendous way to count, there are many superior versions like base 12 and base 6 that are easy to learn and more viable, especially when doing division. Also finger counting is better in base 6, so please don't spread your humans have ten fingers propaganda.


Yes, I know. The metric system and all existing documentation are in base 10. But that's just one of the ways Big Decimal shills are manipulating you. Do you really want to use a bad number system just because ""It has always been like that""? What is this if not Stockholm Syndrome? If you don't want to become a mere statistic it's high time you stand up for yourself.



TL;DR - I loathe how the number 10 is glorified and admired by people.



Edit: Yes I know it is not intuitive to count in other bases, but thats just because you have been accustomed to decimal. Analogous to language, it is hard to pick up a new one.


Also, I am aware the metric system will get destroyed if we change the base. That's not the point. If we had chosen a different base at inception then metric system, math and day to day life would have evolved with it, making that version of counting just as intuitive as decimal.",1671,314,1

1598980883.0,unpopularopinion,"The reason kids spend their days in front of a screen is because you've fucked up all alternative forms of entertainmentPeople often tend to blame the technology itself when complaining about ""kids these days"" spending all their time with their phones, consoles, and so on. But I don't think videogames and Youtube are something like the ultimate form of entertainment. They're great and I love them, sure, but I don't think they're that addictive or ""special"" to get all of a kid's interest by themselves (after all, kids get bored by everything really soon, don't they?)

Let's look at alternative, more ""traditional"" forms of entertainment. I'm only 28 and I can already see how much they've changed. I used to ride my bike all day long since I was 6 or 7 years old, now it's too dangerous for some reason and many kids will only be allowed to do it while the parents are watching. Same for going to the pool or river for a swim. Feel like playing some football? Well, a drop of rain fell two hours ago so no way! Even just for going to the park! There used to be almost no parents there unless their oldest kid was something like 5 years old. Now there are more parents that children! And there's yet another problem. In some areas, there are just no other children around perhaps in dozens of kilometres!

The most drastic example: I used to have play fights with my siblings, cousins, friends and classmates all the time, sometimes even in front of my parents! Sometimes even the parents were cheering!! I'm not saying that's necessarely a good thing, but it's unthinkable only a couple of decades later. And don't even get me started on fighting in the water (which I've probably done like a million times)!

But these are just examples... I have a few reasons to believe I'm right about this ""helicopter-parenting"" being the reason behind kids loving their phones so much:

\- First, in an era of videogames with graphics and playability that we wouldn't even dream of not that long ago, you'd expect things like chess to be almost disappearing. Well, chess is stronger than eve. Whether in my town, my country or my planet, the number of kids playing chess tournaments does not stop to grow.

\- Also, at least in my experience, this trend had started way before things like social media were mainstream. Already by the time I was 12 or so I noticed kids younger than me spent a lot of time watching TV (and I wasn't the only one)

\- And finally, just compare different types of parents, the rules they put, and what their children do. Think of those two annoying bored kids in a family dinner. If parents force them to stay at the table give them a tablet, they'll be on the tablet, but what if they are allowed to leave?

Are you ever going to use the quadratic formula in the future? 99% the answer to this question is a no. However, mathematics is not about applying specifically what you learn in the class, but more so about applying the problem solving abilities that you develop through solving math problems. You have A,B, and C... now how can you get to D? It’s all about critical thinking. This type of critical thinking is important to develop so that later on in life when you need to think hard about a problem and derive a solution, you’re not completely inexperienced with this type of thinking.

Edit: some of you still don’t get it. “When will I factor polynomials by hand” - YOU WONT. But the process of solving difficult math problems, thinking in new ways, and making this a habit of yours is what will help to increase your critical thinking skills - just something to constantly engage your head in so you don’t spend an entire child hood staring at a screen and growing up to become useless and achieve nothing because you have fucked your brain up from a very apparent underwhelming use of it during its development stage.

Edit 2: It is obvious 90% of you aren’t taking the time to read this before forming a response. “WHEN WILL I USE ARBITRARY SUBJECT X”

Edit 3: If you think agreeing with this makes you superior and that people who disagree with this idea are losers... you’re part of the issue here

Edit 4: I know there are other ways to improve critical thinking skills, but each core subject approaches it through a different avenue. When you’re reading the classics, which people also hate to do in school, you’re taking the time to understand the archaic prose that was used in these books, you are recognizing the characters motivations, you are trying to figure out what emotions they are feeling - all subconsciously. This type of critical thinking is different from the type used in math where it is a more strict use of logical statements to get from point A to point B. Training your brain to do well in each arena is well worth it. 

If you’re a STEM major and you think you’re superior because you can solve fancy math equations or write a cool program... you’re not. So many programmers are totally inadequate at for example describing their vision for a future project, selling their idea, etc. - reading some books would help with that!

My wife and I can’t have a second child due to complications during the first pregnancy.

Our son, now five, was really sad he couldn’t have a brother or sister when he was about three. He kept asking for a cat, so thats what we got for our family.

We found Mellow, a fully grey (blue) ragdoll. We took him home when he was seven weeks old. He became instant friends with our son and was basically his protector. When we were outside at the playground, Mellow was there to keep watch. He slept on the rug by his bed or on the covers. When my son would take out the trash, Mellow would escort him. When our son went to a friends house to play, Mellow would wait for at least half an hour by the friends’ door.

He got hit by a car on Saturday. Without going in too much detail: the street is still covered in blood.

He wasn’t even two years old.

Apparently similar posts have been made on this topic before, I didnt realise this. I dont care for karma and was just talking about this acne topic with my boyfriend recently. He said before I told him that he never really thought about it but after he did he realised he also found it cute. This surprised me as I hadnt heard this from anyone before apart from myself.

I had acne when I was younger and it made me feel really insecure, so I had the idea of posting my opinion here to let people struggling with acne know that theyre beautiful :) 

I do have a bad memory though, so maybe I saw one of these posts in passing and got reminded of it after the conversation with my partner. Either way, I dont really care for karma, so this is not fake. 

Also clarifying that this isnt fetish! I find people with acne attractive, but its not a sexual thing. Like I said, I find acne similar to freckles. I think theyre cute details :)

\- The other thing is: I have to admit that this post was rushed. And yes, I am quite inconsiderate in it (for reference see my content below and some of my replies). The funny thing is that while I might think some commenters are oversensitive I have the other end of the spectrum: insensitiveness to some extent and I can also get oversensitive. I don't regret what I wrote (it was a start for a good lesson) but reading through some well thought-out opinions my self-reflection started to operate. Some of you made the assumption that I must not have a lot of experience regarding relationships. That's right. And sometimes I turn into this arrogant person who likes to believe she knows it all (btw I'm female for those who thought otherwise). The reactions are just as harsh as my statement but it's okay. I can understand that what I said can be an effective method in some relationships  (that's great) and cannot be applied in others (which is also valid). And at the end I'm the one who should have stayed more flexible. I should have considered more factors. I want to apologize about that honestly. So thank you all for responding and expressing your viewpoints, now I'll have a lot to think about and a lot to work on. I'm not afraid to face judgement if that's what people feel like giving me based on my content. So thank you for offering the experience. I appreciate both the agreements and disagreements. I'll try and digest them properly in the following days. I'm still think that I'm right about SOME aspects but not anymore do I believe my reasoning is flawless. I wanted everyone who engaged in  this conversation to know that.

**Content:**

Honesty is NOT kindness. Honesty is honesty. Period. I don’t mean you have to be cruel about it but you shouldn’t put honesty aside in favor of toning serious things down. You can be honest and respectful and showing care without being overly soft towards your partner. If you can’t take it well, the problem is you and not the other person. And yes, it is applicable to those who have mental health issues, too.

You can’t just tiptoe around a topic that is basically one of the most essential founding-factors of a (sexual) relationship.

Your partner should be able to freely speak his/her mind (again respectfully and kindly enough which is still not too “soft”) - and how you react to that is YOUR responsibility. The partner doesn’t have to just accept the fact you gained weight just because it’s a sensitive topic to you. I wonder why it’s so sensitive…

Cosmo, vogue, fashion shows, reality t.v. Who is really perpetuating the unattainable standards for women to be skinny, to have matching outfits, to wear loads of makeup and possess flashy jewelry. Most guys, in my experience, never complain or even notice shit like that. But every woman I have known talks shit behind other girl's backs or to their face. And a lot of these are impressionable, young girls that drive so much toxicity. 

And if we're talking about gender standards, there has been a huge reverse in standards against men in the last decade. If men even desire a woman to be in shape or presentable, there's an uproar of sexism. But most women are able to have a laundry list of expectations for men and it goes unchecked. Its ludicrous.

TL;DR: Women have unnecessary beauty standards placed on them but it has nothing to do with men. This is toxic femininity and it's dangerous. Sorry this was so long.

Edit: Okay obviously I didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did so I would like to clarify some things. 

1. This thread was not made to bash women whatsoever. I have no control over the comments made here or if they misconstrued my original point. People who are using this as a platform to ridicule women are doing the exact opposite of having a civil debate.

2. I am simply drawing attention to the fact that we as males are told constantly why we are perpetuating toxic masculinity. But there are huge examples of toxic femininity in our society and this is one of them.

3. People refuting this with facts or having a civil discussion, thank you. Those calling me mysogynistic or saying this post is a circle jerk, I think it's important to look outside your bias and see maybe women have A LOT to work on if they want to strive for a less toxic society.

Call me cynical but it really feels like an ego boost for the people who voted for her. Disabled people and bullied people aren’t your charity case.You see it all over social media and the news, headlines that read, “There are still good people in this world. She was bullied for her disability but her classmates voted her for prom queen.” or “Star basketball players stands up for his bullied classmate”. Sure it seems sweet at first but when I think about it all I can see is someone doing something “nice” for their own personal gain. When these stories make the news, who usually gets the most publicity? Who gets the interviews and good press? Why, the people who did the “good deed” of course. Most of the time it seems like they don’t give a damn about the person who they did something “nice” for, instead it’s about “Look what WE did! WE are so nice! WE are so good hearted!” It’s all about making themselves feel better when they go to sleep at night, it’s almost never about the person it should be about. It’s not sweet and heartwarming, it’s almost sort of heartbreaking because I’ve seen instances where people will do “nice things” for someone because they take pity on the person and it makes them look good in the eyes of others, but go right back to treating that same person like shit as soon as nobody else is paying attention. It was never about being nice and genuine, it was all a big ego boost. If you want to do something nice do it when nobody’s looking and don’t accept any congratulations for your good deed.

ETA: like i said in a reply to a commenter, Sure its a “nice thing to do” and in some cases it makes the disabled person feel good and it’s a nice gesture all around, BUT disabled people aren’t mindless angel pets. They have brains and lots of them don’t like to feel pitied or patronized. Especially when that pity is superficial and the people who give her those pity votes will go right back to ignoring or bullying the disabled person. I’m not saying “Don’t ever be nice because people could misconstrue your motives” I am saying, however, that you should be mindful of your actions and be careful not to make people feel patronized and pitied. Also if you’re gonna do something nice for someone make sure you’re being genuine be consistent with your actions towards someone. Don’t be nice one day and then cruel the next. I know that all good deeds are a little selfish and that’s not my main issue here. The motive isn’t the issue either, it’s the fact that people see others who happen to have a disability as nothing more than a sad little animal to feel sorry for. Instead of mistreating someone, doing one “nice” thing either because you feel sorry for them or you want wholesomeness clout or both, and then going right back to treating that person like shit; you could be genuine in the first place and treat them like any other human being and maybe even develop a true friendship with them. My issue is the publicity and praise people get for being insincere and inconsistent. I really don’t give that much of a shit about “prom queen” or shit like that anyway, I’m using it as an example. I’m almost 20 years old and when I was younger I never ran for those positions anyhow. Another example could be, like people in the comments said, giving a homeless guy $90 and filming it to post on youtube. Instead of patronizing the guy, maybe hire him to help you wash your car or do some yard work and then pay him for his labor. That way he won’t feel pitiful and have such low self esteem.

1614725692.0,unpopularopinion,"Canceling Dr. Seuss is asinine and historically ignorant.As you probably know, Dr. Seuss is in the process of being [unpersonned and erased from childrens' literature](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2021/03/02/books/dr-seuss-mulberry-street.amp.html). The reason is some allegedly racist drawings of Japanese people (more excuses have been brought forth, but I'm focusing in the Japanese issue). 

What the sanctimonious cancelmob is ignorant of is that Seuss belonged to the WWII generation, where many Americans were anti-Japanese (*not* anti-Asian) and many if not most Japanese were anti-American. Virulently so. This was entirely expected, as the two countries were at war with each other. And in fact, both governments actively encouraged such attitudes -- the enemy must be dehumanized in war, as we all know.

Yes, Seuss drew a few propaganda caricatures of the Japanese. And in the same period, the Japanese committed heinous war crimes against American POWs, including [murdering 40% of American prisoners of war](https://time.com/3334677/pow-world-war-two-usa-japan/) in violation of Japanese law and the Geneva Conventions. For reference, less than 1% of American POWs died at the hands of the *Nazis*. 

Now they're chill, but in WWII the Japanese were bloodthirsty, monstrous mass murderers of POWs and civilians alike. They murdered 40 times more American prisoners of war than the fucking *Nazis*. And they refuse to apologize for it to this day.

1638188198.0,unpopularopinion,"Issues like homelessness and ""world hunger"" exist for no reasons other than pure apathy and selfishness. The fact that they exist at all is proof society has failed in it's most basic function.There is enough money in the world to easily feed and house every single person on Earth. With all of the wealth currently being hoarded, the haves could *very easily* provide for the have-nots.

So why don't they? The most common answer I see is something along the lines of ""handouts will make people lazy and the no one will want to work."" I wholeheartedly believe that anyone who says this has never experienced poverty a day in their life. To believe that the *majority of poor people* would be content to scrape by on the bare minimum for the rest of their lives is absurd. The underlying message to this argument is essentially saying that the answer to poverty is for poor people to just ""stop being poor.""

It's as if some people think being poor is a choice. They absolve themselves of guilt by saying that poor people can stop being poor whenever they want if they just stop being lazy. Yes, they can just manifest mental health, a support system of friends and family, clean clothes, access to proper hygiene, a balanced diet, and reliable transportation--they just have to want it bad enough! Absolutely asinine.

The truth is we HAVE the money. We just collectively choose not to help because most of us have decided that it's not our problem.

""It doesn't affect me personally so who cares.""

""Those people made their choice.""

""They're probably criminals/addicts anyway.""

Sentiments like this go against the very point of society: to collectively benefit from co-existence. Ten people living together in a community will thrive exponentially better than if they lived individually. This is because each person has something they can contribute to the overall good of the collective. So it is worth it for the other 9 to occasionally help out the 1 who is facing temporary adversity. The problem is that, at some point, we all decided that homeless people were worthless and that it wasn't worth it to help them. We decided that society would go on just fine without the poorest among us, so why bother wasting resources on helping them?

We've dehumanized poor people to the point that we are no more concerned about their well-being than we are about wild animals. In fact, I'd say most people are more likely to care about abandoned cats & dogs than they are about the homeless.

Most newer cars don't even naturally have that ""roar"" to them, so you're basically trying to squeeze water from a stone when you try to make them sound like an older car.

Motorcycles are especially bad, as it honestly just sounds like ear-splitting flatulence, and the only good use for that is when those bands of motorcycle riders went to military funerals and revved their motors to drown out the hateful chants of Westboro Baptist Church. Other than that, it's just a grating way of saying ""hey, look at me"" that doesn't end up making you look cool so much as it just makes you a nuisance. Don't act surprised if someone gives you a dirty look or yells ""shut up"" at you or something like that, cause you really deserve it if you go around revving your overly-loud noise bike just for the heck of it.

Obviously emergency vehicles are an exception, but that's so you can hear them coming and get out of the way.

I *hate* when people say that because I'm a guy I'll ""never know"" what it's like to walk down the street at night in fear. To me that's just the most idiotic thing - just about EVERYONE has that fear to some degree. It's just my fear is about dying or ending up in the hospital while women's fears are more likely to be about sexual assault. That's all the difference there is. 



I'm not a fighter by any means. I'm not trained, qualified, or confident in my ability to fight off someone who is being violent for whatever reason. Me being a man doesn't mean I'm imbued with crazy hulk-strength automatically, much less know how to use it.



So yeah, I walk down the street at night clutching the knife I carry with me, or my phone unlocked and on the call screen. Stop acting like men never know this fear because they are men. It's unempathetic and makes you look like you struggle to care about other people.

1595869343.0,unpopularopinion,"The “you’ll never use math and science outside of school” narrative in America is horrible, counter-productive, and for the most part not even true.I mean, has The United States of America ever needed math and science more in its history than right now? Telling students this ingrains, for the rest of their life, complacency and disregard for the world around them. 

Math and science classes don’t always have direct application, no, but calling them useless because of that is a naive oversimplification. These classes teach critical thinking. These classes teach problem solving. These classes teach our students *how* to think about things. 

I understand the benefit in telling a student that is struggling in math class that he/she is not destined to be a failure because of it. But that is totally separate from “bragging” (especially around young people) that you don’t use math in your career (even though you probably do even if you don’t realize it). That is being a bad influence on a very easily influenced population of people. 

Math is money. Science is life. You don’t have to be a rocket scientist for these things to be important. And just because you fix air conditioners or sell cars for a living doesn’t mean you are absolved of them. In fact, that ignorance makes you way more prone to someone who does not share it taking advantage of you in life.

In ten years of cleaning for a living, the grossest thing I saw in a men's restroom, was poop stains in the toilet. I worked for a million dollar company, where everyone dressed up. And had money, and the women DESTROYED their bathrooms. Sometimes I wasn't even sure the things I saw, came out of humans.

Secondly, the grossest cars and bedrooms I've been in, were women's. In female friends homes I've seen rotten cheese under the bed, curdled milk on the nightstand. Dirty streaked underwear on the floor, dog shit, used condoms, and more.

She said something like “I’m not sure if they got the roles cuz they’re good AND female or just because of the latter” and it really opened my eyes. 

The current female-centric reboots are mostly flopping (things like Wonder Woman being exceptions). I found Terminator, Power Rangers, Castle, etc. way cooler when they made them EQUALS with men and not simply trash them. Also, wasn’t it more inspiring when women made it big back then? I remember when the chess player Judith Polgar became famous and was right up there with the men. Now, with a separate Chess league for women, nobody really cares about it. But I’m digressing.

Power Rangers vs the new Ghostbusters is my point. Females were part of the original PR team in almost equal numbers. They usually wore pink and such feminine colour but equally kicked butts in battles. That. Was. Awesome. The new Ghostbusters isn’t.

The article that prompted this post was about Mads Mikkelsen replacing Johnny Depp as Grindelwaldt in Fantastic Beasts 3. He says it's going to be tricky to balance tying the old role into the new while also making the character his own. To stay in the Harry Potter universe, this was exactly the issue with Michael Gambon's version of Dumbledore, he didn't read the books, he didn't base his version off of Richard Harris's performance, he made the character ""his own"" and it kinda ruined it. You're an actor, you're supposed to portray the character as it's meant to be portrayed based off of either an author or script writer's description, stop inflicting your own interpretation or acting style into the character.

[Article I was referring to](https://amp.cinemablend.com/news/2559629/fantastic-beasts-mads-mikkelsen-breaks-silence-on-replacing-johnny-depp-as-grindelwald)


Edit: Ok, let me clarify a little bit. I'm mostly talking about characters that have already been established. Particularly if you're replacing someone in a direct sequel, which is the case here (and with Dumbledore in Harry Potter as well). But also if your character is in a book for instance, most of the time the character's persona and mannerisms are described in detail, to me you should try to get it as close as possible to that description and not freely interpreting the character and put your own flair to it. That's my personal opinion on that. It's also not that serious, I read the article, that statement annoyed me in the context of this movie specifically so I made the post. Also, Richard Harris is the superior Dumbledore, fight me!


Edit 2: My first 1k+ post and it's because people don't agree with me, great, lol. I think the best counter argument I've seen is that we don't want Mads to play Johnny Depp playing Grindelwaldt, which could be a very easy thing to happen if he doesn't make the character his own, and would be quite cringy probably.

1600267954.0,unpopularopinion,"Gun safety safety training should be a mandatory class in high schoolThe justification for Sex Education is that ignorance is more dangerous than knowledge. The same holds true for firearms. Far too many people are shot with ""unloaded"" guns. Ignorance of what guns are and how they work is more dangerous than people knowing what they are, what they can do, and how to safely handle them.

EDIT:

1. Even if you believe that guns should be banned, the legal process for accomplishing this in the US would take decades. It's extremely difficult to alter our constitution, there's considerable opposition to changing it, and the political reality it that it is easier to leave the constitution the way it is than it is to change it. Consequently, even if you want to ban all guns, it still makes sense to teach kids to safely handle them as an interim solution.
2. Teaching kids how to safely handle firearms will not help them shoot up a school. Someone who has never handled one before can figure out how to fire it within a few minutes, especially with movies, computer games, and Google as a guide. Firearms are designed to be as easy to use as possible. Using them destructively is extremely easy. Consequently, handling them safely is harder than using them destructively and requires training.
3. You don't need to bring guns into schools to teach kids how to safely handle them for the same reason you don't need to have sex in the classroom to teach kids how to use a condom.
4. For those who aren't from the US: To understand why the US is ""obsessed"" with guns, you have to understand US history. The US was founded by rebels who were rebelling against a tyrannical  government and they wanted to retain the ability to rebel against their  new government should it also become tyrannical. This is as true today as it was the day it was written. A reasonable argument can be made that  the second amendment protects weapons which are necessary for  overthrowing our own government, should it become tyrannical. It's a  healthy thing for our politicians to be a little afraid of us.
5. Requiring gun safety training, background checks, and licenses at the point of sale simply doesn't work. There are a plethora of ways that your child can encounter a gun without purchasing one. For example, I very vividly remember climbing into my parent's attic  through the ceiling of an unfinished bathroom(which I'm certain they  didn't think I could do) and showing my friends, without the knowledge of their parents, one of my dad's rifles for no other reason than because I thought it was really cool. No one died but someone easily could have. I had no fucking idea what I was doing. There is simply no way that any law or  requirement at the point of sale can prevent scenarios like that from happening.
6. Teaching kids to shoot guns isn't the point. The point is to teach kids how to avoid firing a gun by accident if they encounter one.
7. Not everyone will own a gun and not everyone will encounter a gun during their life. However, the problem is that we don't know which kids will encounter guns and which won't. Therefore, the only way to teach gun safety to the kids who need it is to teach it to all of them.",3218,574,1

He confessed to recording and distributing a video of a man having sex with a 13-year-old girl and yet... he is literally one of the most prominent artists of 2020 so far?

A lot of the people who like him are millennials and zoomers, who I believed to be progressive enough to shut this type of shit down, yet here we are. This guy is out here topping the charts and everything he says and does is absolutely blown up and near impossible to ignore if you're someone who tries to stay to date with the newest music and media.

I genuinely don't understand it, and I'm disgusted by it. I also just don't get how he has a likeable appearance either if we're going to the more shallow part of my opinion. He's fucking ugly and has purposely destroyed his physical appearance and looks like he hasn't bathed in weeks. He is always getting in trouble and flaming other people and he is just everything a person shouldn't be, and yet he is at the top of the game and unfortunately succeeding.

I personally believe he deserves the opposite of everything he's gained in these past few months. I also no longer like anyone who decides to work with him. It's one thing to separate the art from the artist but to boast the artist by openly & proudly working with the artist (looking at Nicki) makes you seem like you have no problem with working with that sick asshole.

That's all I care about, not the people he snitched out (they probably had it coming if they had shit that needed to be snitched about to begin with). It just saddens me to think about her.

1616398670.0,unpopularopinion,"If you are pirating something that isn't available in your country then it is perfectly fine to do it.As the title says, I don't see any wrong in pirating content that isn't available to buy in your country. I think you are rather doing the content creator team a favor by doing so as you are in a way increasing the popularity of the show and the people who have access to the content and can afford to buy the dvd might be more inclined to buy something that is more popular. So you are kind of doing them a favor by pirating their content.

Moreover I think people should make it a habit to at least rate the movie or series that they watch. That way you'll be contributing to the popularity of the show.

So yeah that's my two cent. I can't write like most of the other people here as english is my second language. Anyway if it makes sense then that's pretty cool. If it doesn't then please don't downvote as downvoting would cause it to die in new without any interaction and I won't get to hear why my view isn't correct.

Edit:

I very well understand that piracy is not acceptable, but the current model of content delivery is broken. At the moment I have no qualms whatsoever ripping off the odd movie and TV show that isn't available to buy in my country and I see no reason to not experience something for a reason like not being available. There's so much infighting and lack of collaboration from TV and movie studios that no one service is good enough.

I go to the cinema plenty, and I buy movie dvds when I have the chance, so i pay my dues. But this experience is getting less and less pleasurable as it is struggling to compete with my 4k TV connected to my PC at home where I can easily download any movie or series and stream/play it easily. But I always make it an attempt to look for a possibility to watch it in a way that it contributes to the content creator. If it's not available then of course piracy is going to be my choice.

If you look at it then piracy is entirely a distribution problem. There will always be some people who pirate no matter what but majority of people might pirate for only easy access and not only for the sake of pirating. Let's take Netflix(subscribed to it) for example , it allows us to browse large numbers of movies , watching previews of them and then watch it on the spot. Most methods of piracy require you to download the complete movie first and then watch it. This is exactly why streaming platform like Netflix is so popular. Now if only if these studios would realize that the only thing Netflix needs is selection. If pretty much every movie and show go to netflix then piracy would take a huge hit.

Now about buying the DVDs. Here in India we don't have stores where you can just go and buy or rent the dvd. And most of the tv/series and movies are not even available to buy on amazon/prime video , even google play. Anime industry is another entire problem. The ease of access is absolutely non existent.",2976,561,1

Here's my problems with them

- Hand-brakes : used to be a handle you'd pull, super practical and easy to grab and pull / pump in case of emergency like a brake failure or bad road conditions like black ice. Now it's just a fucking button. No way am I finding it in time in an emergency.

- sliding doors on vans : used to be you could just use the handle and pull the whole door completely open in half a second. Now I use the handle, try to pull the door open but NOOOO it's on its own tiny engine that slowly draws the door in open position over 3 full seconds. Useless.

- windows : used to be a little rolling handle. If it broke you could change the mechanism for like 50$. Now if your tiny electronic window stops rolling down they gotta dismantle the whole door and replace the electronics for 5-6 times the price.

- Trunks with no handles : WHY ? ITS A DOOR. WHY DO I HAVE TO GO TO MY OTHER DOOR TO FIND A BUTTON FOR THE DOOR I'M TRYING TO GET INTO ? FUCK.

- trunks you can't just push down. The SUVs are really bad for that one, you try to close the damn trunk and you're forcing against whatever piece of shit motor they have in there to close it for you with a button. And no it's not about customer's height because most often the damn button is exactly where you'd grab the trunk door to close it. Just another useless feature.

-  The seats : Pull the side handle to adjust seatback, pull underside handle to adjust seat distance. Moves almost instantly and follows your own movements. Instinctive and easy. Now it's again, 3-4 piece of shit plastic button that I have to wait for to do their job at a snail's pace and, just like windows, they will eventually  break (which I've never seen on the seat adjustments on older cars that weren't in accidents) and cost you 5-6 times the price to fix.

- Cameras on 37 angles :  USE YOUR FUCKING EYES. 5000$ price hike *at least* to stick cameras everywhere just because people can't be bothered to take a 2 second look around before backing up into their own kid. And those cameras will never last as long as the car anyway. I legit saw cameras turn on when you put your blinkers and it showed *exactly* what the side mirror was showing. 

- self adjusting seat : the goddamn thing moves back when you turn off the engine, (I imagine to let fat Americans out of the car,) moves back to position when you turn it on. Why? WHYYYYYY ? If your seat is properly adjusted once, you should be able to get in and out of it and never touch the fucking thing again.

In america, to become be in a medical career, you need 8 years of school vs the 6 years at other countries. 


In those 8 years of school, I must take philosophy, sociology, and speech to get an undergraduate in biology. There are *some* classes you can wriggle an argument for, like physics 1 or writing, but probably not physics 2 or speech.



Saying ""colleges just want to make you well rounded"" makes you sound like (and I hate using this term) a sheep. To my understanding, American colleges were more identical to the rest of the world's some time ago. (Not 100% sure on that) So, by saying that colleges want to make you more well-rounded is like saying previous generations of STEM field grads weren't (*or even grads from other countries that is*).  Taking philosophy for 1 semester isn't going to turn my life upside down, not 90°, not 45°, not even 1°.


Edit: ok, I understand and agree that philosophy is important. However, learning that other countries do not require 8 years of education to be in a medical field, makes me irritated at my beloved country. I just used philosophy as pet peeve to get a point across. 1 semester of a particular liberal art feels more like an excuse to siphon money, especially if it is considered vital for an undergraduate that is completely irrelevant. Hell, my school has bio ethics, I haven't taken it yet but that seems like a lovely way to possibly blend philosophy and biology, keeping it relevant.

1596018559.0,unpopularopinion,"The majority of offended people will fake emotional outrage in order to terminate any civil discussionIn my anecdotal observation, many people who quickly escalate their outrage have done so to manipulate the core of discussion from one that revolves around facts and data to one that focuses solely on feelings and perceived virtue through victimhood. They perceive their outrage to be virtuous, and that the more outraged they are about said topic, the more virtue they hold over you. The argument quickly becomes less about the topic and more about you as an opponent.

Masking disingenuous motives under the guise of righteousness is what makes this behaviour particularly reprehensible. Two human beings should be able to have a civil disagreement on anything - even if one the persons views are seemingly ridiculous, (Earth being flat, etc). To be open minded you must try to understand _why_ they believe what they believe and maybe stand a chance of educating them, or at least coming out of the conversation better understanding the root cause of their misguided beliefs. Maybe I’m too much of an optimist.

EDIT: To clarify, this is obviously a generalisation and doesn’t apply to all cases. It also does not appeal to the idea that someone who is outraged is wrong and someone who isn’t is right.

We all have certain things that we prefer in the bedroom. You’re not a prude if you don’t publicly broadcast your sexuality or kinks... it just means that you value and respect your sexual identity enough to keep it private.

IMO - It’s really no one else’s business at the end of the day except for me and my partner.



EDIT: I’m not sure why people in the comments are so adamant about forcing the conversation towards the LGBTQ or gay community.... Nowhere in my post did I directly target those communities. I used the term “sexuality” because it’s a blanket term that covers all sexual orientations. Straight, bi, gay, or trans - anyone from any sexual orientation can be guilty of attention whoring.",1277,216,1

1602335015.0,unpopularopinion,"GMO’s are not bad and are not unhealthy.This isn’t really an opinion but everyone seems to think so. I’m under the impression that people don’t even know what genetically modified even means and everyone is falling for propaganda that companies are using to mark up their products. 

Genetically modified crops, most of the time, are crops that have been through artificial selection. That means we noticed a couple of plants that we were growing produced bigger fruit with less seeds or they are less likely to die from weather or from pests or etc, so bred them with each other to create the plant that we enjoy today. This is something that happens naturally through evolution and natural selection as well. There’s nothing crazy or unhealthy about it. It doesn’t change the fruit or vegetables nutrition very much and it certainly doesn’t make it less healthy. 

Another way we genetically modify, which is less likely, is that we give the plant DNA that does all the things artificial selection does like pest resistance, longer growing season, bigger fruit, etc. except it takes a way shorter time. it is actually very helpful environmentally because it reduces the use pesticides. There arent any adverse health effects- it’s still just a fruit or vegetable. There are positive environmental effects. 

Another big point is that there are only something like 10 crops that are genetically modified and sold in America. So when something says “non GMO” it never would’ve had GMOs anyway. It doesn’t make it healthier. I got a chocolate bar that said “non GMO” and I was like ???? This is totally just a marketing scheme.

They offer hundreds of hours of playability only from the single player modes thanks to rich open world's, rich narrative and great replay value. I have had Red Dead Redemption since launch day and still play it frequently to this day.

Now in some cases online multiplayer is fine but not in recent times. Take GTA online for example. In 2013 it was good but with the new updates and expansions it's not short of being unplayable with players flying across the maps and shooting you every time you spawn. Another issue is modders and tryhards who do their UTMOST best to ruin your and your friends game. I cannot walk in warzone without being sniped from the other side of the map or encountering campers. Single player is also more stable thanks to not requiring an internet connection and thus allows even people in Somalia to play without interruption. Also people are more peaceful as nobody in single player shouts or sings into a mic whilst you're playing. Believe me, we could all use some peace.

Lastly I would like to say this does not apply to all online games, but most. I'm not sure if this has been done before so if it has pls say and I'll delete.

1556098997.0,unpopularopinion,"Instagram is ruining everything (a rant)I think that Instagram is one of the worst developments in modern culture. Let me explain:

1. **IG is the most shallow of all social media platforms**. While social media platforms like twitter and sometimes even Facebook politically engage people, allow them to connect and organise Instagram is solely based on one person and their looks/life/vacation. No political or important dialogue is happening. I would argue that even Pinterest is more worthwile since at least DIYs teach you something.
2. **IG is all fake but everyone pretends that it's real.** Why we are all pretty much aware from our own Instagram use that these images are usually not what our lives look like all instagram users apparently have this pact that they are just all going to believe each other's bullshit.
3. **IG is bad for your mental health.** Because unrealistic standards are set on Instagram but everyone just pretends like they're real people doing real things it feels like everybody's life is the way it looks in IG. This also creates feelings of inadequacy and is therefore detrimental to especially young people's mental health. (See also this article: [http://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/](http://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/)). I also think this applies equally to women and men since the unrealistic standards concerning looks and lifestyle are more than ever directed towards both genders while they previously were more directed towards women as in e.g. advertising.  Additionally, the dopamine rush people get from likes creates an almost addiction-like potential that makes them use the app more and more and making the mental health issues even more pronounced.
4. **IG makes people vain.** Taking pictures of yourself all day makes you the center of your own attention and that leads to ignoring other people and the actual experience you're documenting. It's not about where you went what you ate or what incredible experience you had but only what it looked like and what you looked like doing it. This makes everybody focus more and more on their own appearance and less about things that actually make you a successful human being.
5. **IG gives the worst incentives to people.** The reason I am ranting right now is that I saw a Vice video about a poppy field in California that is killed by people sitting and stepping on it to take pictures predominantly for Instagram (Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxUrr-CIgkA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxUrr-CIgkA)). They then talked to the people taking the pictures asking them why they're doing it and their answers made me incredibly angry. Some people were open about just wanting likes but some others pretended like they were really concerned about the flowers talking about ""the feeling of being one with nature"". So these people want to signal to others that they love nature and the beauty of it while literally destroying the natural habitat and the flowers. This shows that they really don't care about anything at all except their likes on a goddamn picture. Now I don't think that they are inherently bad people but I think that Instagram actively gives them an incentive to be this way fuelled by the addictive potential of the platform and the likes you get from it.

I would encourage anyone reading this to please examine how much time you spend on Instagram and if you get anything from it than a simple dopamine rush and feelings of inadequacy and think of what you could do that's more meaningful and actually makes you happy.

&#x200B;

EDIT: A lot of people are posting that they follow artists, architects, blacksmiths etc. and use Instagram predominantly in a small community or niche. So just to clarify, I do think that one can use Instagram positively and get a lot of good content from it. What I wanted to point out in my post is the culture that evolved around instagram and especially individual people posting nothing but their lives. And while some of you are so blessed as to not experience this culture in your everyday lives I feel like for others the posting ""cute"" pictures of oneself is a crucial part of social life e.g. kids in middle/high school. I do think that every social media platform can be great since it really depends on the users and what they post. However, I feel that while some good Instagram accounts exist the majority is selfies, vacation and food pictures and that this makes some people feel that they to share this much of their lives as well.",4569,746,1

I get it, Mommy needs a break and Daddy wants to have a beer with his buddies.  But *you* signed on for this when you chose to become parents.  How can some people be completely unapologetic about exuding some of their friends, then have such an utter lack of self awareness to cry foul when *they* aren't invited to something? 

""You didn't invite me because of the kids, didn't you?!""

Yes.  Because we wanted to drink and swear and watch a few horror movies while shooting the shit.  Just like you didn't invite your single, childfree friends because you wanted to chat with your mom friends while your kids had a play date.

I don't need screaming children at my wedding, SPECIALLY if I have no kids. I want an adult night, with adult drinks, a nice reception, and to be able to let lose.

I don't really care how ""quiet and  polite"" your kids are or how you'll keep him out of the way. I love kids, I want kids , but at a party I paid thousands for it to be perfect( not as in looks, i mean as in the atmosphere and the stress level) for me and my spouse? No thanks. Respect them, if people say no exceptions when they tell you no kids at their wedding, respect that!

Don't ask, don't say that's rude, no backhanded compliments. As long as they gave you time to plan for a sitter, it shouldn't be seen as a bad thing. Don't try and make ppl feel bad about it. And do not try to sneak your kids in by bringing them on the day. Personally I wont let you in( gosh that sounds mean) but if they do let you in, you're going to look TERRIBLE, and bratty.

no i do not hate kids, i love them but you just dont bring them to places that are not kid friendly.

With me, its just a behavior issue so teens (13 and up) are fine. They have manners and know when to be quiet and what is appropriate.

No its not about getting drunk (someone mentioned drugs? wtf) It is about people being able to relax and have fun without worrying that little Timmy is gonna grab a butter knife or that 3 year old Amy is gonna get on the table or run into a waiter.

If Someone says no kids and you have a long time to get a sitter but just dont want to go due to this...that should be fine with you. it aint that big a deal, celebrate another time:)

My view of what a wedding is about may be different than yours..thats fine. I dont judge you for having kids there, your choice man, all i ask is that you dont get angry when i say no kids. imma be sad you can't go but im not gonna hate you over it and i hope it is vice versa.

No i am not asking for gifts at my wedding. I want to specify that.

UPDATE: Wow. Um, I’ve never really had a popular Reddit post before, so thanks to all of you who upvoted because you hate me. It means a lot. I’ve noticed a pretty big trend in the comments. About half agree with me that while yes, it is a good series of both books and movies, it isn’t so amazing that it makes sense for it to have lasted so long.

1. If you read through the comments you’ll learn that I’ve seen all the movies, but I’ve only read books one and two. This is what my entire opinion was based on. As a preteen I read all the time. I grew up in a tiny town where in the summer all I could do was read or play outside. I got so bored that I would read the farmer’s almanac... I went into Harry Potter thinking I would love it because, well, everyone does. I read the first two and was kinda disappointed. It WAS good, it just wasn’t get-a-lighting-bolt-tattoo kinda good. That’s my whole opinion. Harry Potter is a good series. In my opinion, it’s just not good enough to have lasted so long in popular media. To me it’s not good enough to want to talk about it all the time, make an Instagram account about it, get a bumper sticker about it, stuff like that. I respect people who do, I just don’t get it at all because to me they were fine, but not exceptional. I think they’re overrated, not bad, that’s the whole post.

1615945132.0,unpopularopinion,"High school should start at 10 AM and no earlierI see this as a disgruntled student who has school at 7:20 in the morning and has to wake up before 6 am just to make it to class in time.

We know TWO things about teenagers: (1) they need between 8-10 hours of sleep per night and (2) that their circadian rhythms, or the biological mechanism that regulates human sleep and wakeness patterns, operate in a way that, on average, they don't start producing melatonin until after 11 PM. 

Taking those two facts into consideration, the typical high class has class at around 7 am and most students have to wake up between an hour or two hours before their first class if they don't want to be late. So like at 5 or 6 am. Let's assume that teens fall asleep right on the dot at 11 pm (even though in reality they actually fall asleep much later since melatonin takes time to induce sleep), and have to wake up at 6 am. That's only 7 hours of sleep, which is already under the 8-10 hour requirement.

And in reality since most teens fall asleep at least 15 or so minutes after 11 PM, as well as how some students wake up for school even earlier than 6, you have students getting between 4 and 6 hours of sleep, and this situation gets worse for students with jobs, lots of family obligations, extracurriculars, or lots of homework. 

These earlier start times just DON'T work. We already have the data for why they're a terrible idea and even the CDC recommends that all high schools start no earlier than 8:30 am.

The reason I say 10 instead of 8:30 is because those same students who fall asleep at midnight and have to wake up two or so hours before school starts to make it on time would get 8 or 9 hours of sleep. You would have to fall asleep at 1 or 2 am to fall below the 8-10 number. That's way better than if you had school at 8:30 or even nine.

And I know what people are gonna say. But what about students with jobs? What about athletics or clubs? What if the school day is longer?

Well, for athletics or clubs you can either have them at 9 am or have them as part of the regular school day if we reduce instruction time (which we should do anyway), so that way people don't have to stay after school. You can also have tutorials and additional help during these times. 

And about students with jobs, well I'm sorry but the rest of the school body shouldn't have to suffer because a minority of students have jobs. What's more, with a later start time, people have more time to spend doing things in the evening so maybe try to adjust your hours with your boss? 

(I also think we shouldn't assign homework but that's a popular opinion lol) 


*TL; DR*, a 10 AM start time would allow students to get the recommended sleep more easily and more often, improve grades, attendence, and classroom participation, and also greatly benefit student health, both physically and mentally. Let's do it!

Edit:

I forgot to put this in the original:

Also we can shorten the school day so we get out at like 3:45 pm or something. Research shows that classes really shouldn't be longer than an hour anyway. Some of y'all literally have no imagination or problem solving skills lol.

So, yeah, this has been my rant, and I know it is a long one, but it can be sometimes tiring to be able to evaluate a situation/argument solely on its merits when fanatically supporting, sounds and is very easy. But that said, I would never want to trade it for anything. 

PS: I do not mean to sound boastful or arrogant, it's just what I have observed, and yeah not everyone is like that, but the number people willing to accept that their argument can be flawed is low.

What is the irony for me is that we have developed this cultural belief that video games are nothing but a waste of time and money and have no impact or value in human societies or within people's personal lives and hobbies.

But then again, we also have reinforced this idea that watching Netflix all day long or binge watching multiple episodes or marathons and watching on the couch and eating snacks all day long is considered a good thing or a healthy thing even.

Doesn't this clearly constitute a cruel and unusual punishment? Why do we normalize this as an expectation of being incarcerated? What's perhaps more disturbing is that almost everyone knows this happens and just accepts it as a fact of life. It's really not acceptable or permissible and we should stop normalizing it.

We all know there’s two sides to every story. We also all know that retail jobs suck, pay crap, and the majority of retail managers may not always be the best, some can be the absolute worst. But if you think it’s cool to quit on a live stream or tik-tok to call out some bad manager who nobody else knows, and show to your fans how cool and edgy you think you are, you’re an idiot. No different than the clowns who film an argument to show the world ….thinking they’re right…… only to get shamed for their sheer stupidity and lack of self-awareness later. 

Sure your feelings may be real and reasons for quitting are legit, but it’s obvious as you read your prepared notes, your voice trembles and your hands shake, that you’re just showing off and doing this performance for tik tok and so your friends can high five you for sticking it to the “man-anger” later, and it’s painfully obvious they wouldn’t be putting on the same shit show while quitting if it weren’t for the camera.

What this narcissistic display shows the world is that from a professional employment standpoint, you aren’t able to process or handle your emotions very well under pressure, and that these folks have issues taking responsibility, and handling themselves in a mature way. 

That said most of these videos so far seem to be teens, or not always fully matured emotionally, while adults are usually the evil managers, which makes sense. So I give them some leeway for being teens, but if adults start doing this  petty crap God help us. 

All this is simply indulging in one's anger to make the person feel better about quitting. Trust, managers ain’t going home feeling bad or questioning themselves over losing you as an employee because you quit while making an ass out of yourself. You made this easy for them they didn’t need to fire you. 

It really just ends up looking like nothing more than a cheap shot. A punch to the back of the head as you walk away. The person doing it looks very weak. 

Be strong. Be mature and quit like an adult, and move on if you can’t take your job or manager. Everything in life doesn’t need to be a tik tok show for your friends.

1619358442.0,unpopularopinion,"Watching a small Twitch streamer who is bad at video games is more entertaining than watching a big shot Twitch streamer who is great at video games.So for this I have various points and don’t feel like writing an essay so going to just make a list. Know going into this that the appeal of Twitch for me is the sense of community.
1) The occasional failure of someone who isn’t great at video games humanizes them in a way. Seeing the failure that they sometimes have makes them seem real. Streamers who can destroy a game lobby seem like gods. An entity separate from humanity. Their caliber and constant success undermines the most interesting part of humanity. Failure. That’s why I don’t find them entertaining when they play video games. 
2) There are too many people watching those huge streamers and too many people in the chat. I know that this is kinda in the job description of being a huge streamer, but Twitch is supposed to be a platform to interact with the streamer. Instead, it feels like a constant gamble wether or not the streamer will even acknowledge your existence. There is constant spam which makes the chat even more overwhelming. You don’t get that with small streamers. Having ten people at any given time watching the stream makes you feel special. Nine out of ten times, the streamer will read your chat message. Sometimes it might turn into a full conversation. Hell, if you’re lucky, you might even get bumped up to VIP status. You feel significant. Appreciated. 
3) Kind of going off of the previous point, everything nice that you do matters to a small streamer. Wether it’s donating bits or subscribing or gifting a subscription, the small streamer will actually appreciate that. Not to say that all huge streamers are scumbags because a good amount aren’t, but there are a lot of big streamers where any monetary donation doesn’t really matter to them. I used to watch a streamer who had 65,000 subscribers. I’m sure they have more now, but in order to not call them out, I’m just going to to use 65,000 while doing math. A tier-1 subscription costs 5 dollars. Twitch partners get about half of the money from a subscription, the other half goes to Twitch itself. 65,000x2.5=162,500.

The sandwich is delicious without that.


Maybe I'm missing something. But I truly don't believe that I am. Tomatoes can go away and the food world would be better for it. I only recently started to accept ketchup for just burgers, but honestly that can go too if it means no more tomatoes involved ever again.

Not one relationship is the same as the other. Everyone is different and each relationship is unique. No one can know how it will work out or what goes on in the relationship. You can be 60 year old with 300 past relationships and tons of experience, but you are still in no place to judge whether the relationship is going to last or not.

1599077659.0,unpopularopinion,"Your partner’s masturbation habits are none of your business (with four exceptions)Advice-Reddit is filled with people being up in arms about how their SOs masturbate. Men who don’t want women to use dildos or vibrators; women who don’t want men to watch porn (or some specific kind of porn); people of all genders who feel somehow rejected or even cheated on when their partner masturbates.

When someone wants to control what their SO wears or their hobbies or social life, everyone is quick to proclaim how controlling, boundary-trampling, and potentially abusive this behavior is. But when it comes to people laying out rules for how/if their SO can masturbate, somehow this is treated as a normal and okay thing for a partner to have control over.

This is NOT normal or okay. 

Your insecurities about your SO masturbating are not your SO’s problem. 

Being in a monogamous sexual relationship doesn’t grant you dominion over the other person’s body and mind. 

People get to think and fantasize about whatever tf they want, watch whatever tf kind of porn they want, and masturbate however and with whatever tf kind of toys they want. Trying to police that because you are insecure is totally inappropriate and controlling behavior. You should neither do this to a partner nor tolerate a partner doing it to you. 

Exceptions where it’s okay for a partner to make requests / impose their opinions:
- Excessive masturbation/porn addiction negatively impacts the couple’s sex life
- Matters of basic courtesy (e.g., don’t leave porn out on the computer; don’t do it in the bed next to me, etc.)
- When it involves interactions with real people (e.g., virtual sex workers or sexting with internet strangers)
- Obviously if it involves anything dangerous or illegal (e.g., public masturbation or self-asphyxiation).",1817,299,1

I elected for the bed.

1593183436.0,unpopularopinion,"As a former pothead, I consider marijuana to be a much more harmful drug than people consider it to be.The thing about marijuana is not that it's physically harmful. It's mentally and emotionally harmful. It encourages you to use it habitually. It might not be physically addicting but it's certainly highly psychologically addicting. How many people do you know who use marijuana casually? The problem is that people abuse it frequently, and it causes them to suffer or atrophy in other areas of their lives, or they use it to cope with something else they're not willing to confront.

For me, I used weed as an excuse to not participate in society. Rather than see my friends I would just get stoned and turn off my phone. I wouldn't talk to anyone or go out. I was afraid to go out so I used weed as an excuse not to.

This caused me to have low self esteem. I thought of myself as a loser pothead - because I was. I think many potheads feel this way, but they would never admit it to anyone else.

But once I finally decided to drop it once and for all, my life has improved so drastically. I felt like a human again, like a member of society. And I realized that it hardly even did anything for me anyway. It turned me into a stupid person. I'm not stupid.

I think the damage that marijuana does is complex, but significant. I think the culture surrounding it and its reputation as a ""safe"" drug is extremely dangerous.

To quote the great and wise Randy Marsh:

>Well, Stan, the truth is marijuana probably isn't gonna make you kill people, and it most likely isn't gonna fund terrorism, but… well, son, pot makes you feel fine with being bored. And it's when you're bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or being creative. If you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you aren't good at *anything*.

edit: This thread really blew up so I would add on: if you feel you're in a similar situation to mine, my best advice is to reconnect with friends and focus on your abilities, skills, and talents. When I quit I focused more on my creative writing and that built my self esteem like crazy. I realized that the feeling of fulfillment and happiness I got from doing this every day was far greater than the meager feeling of being high that I got from marijuana. I'm now on track to finish my first novel by the end of the year.

A lot of comments are talking about how moderation is key and not everyone uses it the same. My question is: why use this drug at all? What does it help you with? And for whatever problem it is, is there another, more organic way you could solve this problem? For example if you have anxiety, maybe you can work on therapy or confronting this issue and trying to get some closure.

If you feel the need to get high every day, ask yourself: Do I enjoy life without this drug? And if not, try to figure out why that is and what could help to change it.",2932,551,1

This is to encourage ""perfect attendance"" and it is harmful to the child in more than one way. 

1. The child is pressured into attending school even when sick, further suppressing an immune system that is already stressed by environmental factors. This can lead to a number of complications for the child, both short and long term, from leaving them susceptible to secondary infection, to the development of autoimmune disorders. If the child is taught to take proper care of their health and to heal when they are ill, then they will be better off in both regards.
2. The child is being conditioned to work ill. The future can never change to allow for better work conditions if the next generation does not progress beyond what the previous has. From a young age, American children are taught they must suck it up and work through it. Studies have shown that if a worker is given a generous sick leave, not only does the productivity go up but the medical cost goes down because the chances of serious illnesses are reduced. Workers can afford to stay home when they are sick. Our students are taught that working ill is what is expected of them and not only is it expected but most schools are tightening the noose and making it harder for the children to take leave when necessary. By the time an adult emerges from the school, they are used to ""shaking it off.""
3. The financial burden that is placed on a family because of policy change requiring doctors notes when insurance is not widely affordable, nor is a visit to a local doctor exactly cheap. A same-day visit to a local urgent care can easily run two hundred to three hundred dollars. This is also coupled with the hit already being taken by a parent that is missing work and may or may not have paid leave to do so. If a note is not returned to the school from a local doctor, at the very least the absence is unexcused and counts against the child, affecting everything from grades to driver licenses. In more strict counties and municipalities, a child can be counted truant without the doctor's note. Policies like these are ill-guided and do not produce the results desired. They impact grades and performance in a negative manner and hurt the morale of both parent and student.

Unfortunately, in today's world, schools influence our children more than we can ever realize. They shape much of their rationale and critical thinking skills that will follow them for the rest of their lives. As parents, it is up to each of us, to be active in trying to shape the policy that governs the school system.",2893,515,1

Listen, pretty sparkly rainbow pictures don't automatically make a film artful, or cinematically significant. This is *especially* true when your entire business model is about mass producing the same superhero movie 20 times.
 
The reality of the matter is that the overwhelming majority of all Marvel films are shot in the same cookie-cutter manner. The framing is acceptable, the symbolism of shots is very, **VERY** heavy-handed at *BEST* - oh my god guyz, look, the 3 good guyz are in the light bit of the sky and the evil baddies are down in the dark bit wif the clouds behind them!!!! woaah!!!! good symbolism guyz!!!! - and a good 99% of the soundtracks are forgettable as all hell.

1615184964.0,unpopularopinion,"Screaming the way people do in metal and some rock music is impressive as fuck and I’m tired of people saying it’s notBefore I begin I want to explain why I believe this is unpopular: pop and rap music are so much more popular than metal just by looking at monthly listeners on Spotify. Pop artists and rappers can have up to 50 million monthly listeners meanwhile the biggest metal band in history has 16 million (which is still a lot obviously but in defense of my point, they hardly ever feature screaming in their music)

Ok with that out of the way, every time I see people hating on rock and metal, about 99% of people’s complaints are “they’re just screaming, it takes no talent, anyone can do it” which is just plain false. People who can do that shit with their voice are extremely talented, and the people who can do that at a live concert for up to like 2 hours straight are even more talented. It takes talent, skill, practice, and technique to do it properly and many vocalists have to work their asses off for YEARS to learn to do it well enough to be in a band. 

I dare you right now to try to scream like they do in metal. Do either a really high deathcore scream or a really low death metal growl. Yeah sure you can try but I’d be willing to be all my money if you just tried for the first time, it sounds nothing like it does in the music. 

There’s a video on YouTube where a guy goes in public and asks a bunch of random people to “give him their best metal scream”. About 95% of people can’t do it. But when someone CAN do it, he then asks them how long they’ve been doing vocals, and the answer is always the same. Years. Many years.

There are variations of this but that's the basic premise.Every. Single. Time. that man is torn apart in the comments, saying that blood does not matter, the child is not at fault, how on earth could he leave them etc.Frankly, I think this is nonsense, through and through. The narrative of these comments always focuses on the man being horrible for leaving and that the child is his because of the time they spent together and not that he was a victim of a lying spouse that deceived him for years.  And for a relevant bit of background, I was adopted as a child and I absolutely believe blood/genetics do not matter in making a family at all. But the big thing there is that for my parents, there was a choice. They made the informed decision that they would accept my as their child, it was not forced on them.Now don't get me wrong, I don't think the men in these examples are saints at all, but so often they are accused of never even caring for the kid(s) and that they must be terrible for being so ruthless. What never gets mentioned, or is at least glossed over, is that the man in question just had his whole life upended by finding out that his partner in life cheated and deceived him for possibly years on end and his life is going to be turmoil. And if this occurs in the US at least, the man is still going to be on the hook for child support even with the proof the kid is not his, meaning he doesn't even get to go restart his life if he wants to, but instead is tied to the situation where he was the victim.You can hope that the man's love for the child might break through that, but it's unfair to attack him because he isn't strong enough to overcome what was done to him. To him, that child will be the living embodiment of the mother's deception and cruelty and to ridicule someone for not wanting that to be part of their life is absurd.Lastly, for the people who say something like ""I could never leave my child/I wouldn't do that!""... well good for you, but it's easy to say that sort of thing, and even if its true, that doesn't mean someone who can't handle that sort of thing is a monster.

EDIT:
Hi guys, thank you all for joining in the discussion, i would like to comment on and apologize for some things:
   I was a bit short-spoken on the whole thing. To clarify my thoughts: being *habitually* (big thanks to the +200 comments pointing that out, as well as the ""you're"" mistake) late means over 30-n/a minutes on most occasions, of course I do not expect everyone being punctual constantly, nobody is.
   I am sorry for not including any mental/physical difficulties as an ""adequate excuse"" (ADHD/IBS/EFD/OCD etc.) and did not mean to sound ableist, hope i did not ruin many of your days with this and i have nothing against neurodivergent people (Still, big shout-out to the few ADHD/other comments striving to be punctual even though it's difficult, i have nothing but respect for you).
  Secondary: Having kids/Overworking/Traffic/Weather/other miscalculations are also, of course, a proper excuse. Culture (as a lot of you pointed out) is also very common and i have an opposite personal example: I studied Cooking and got sucked in the whole Kitchen Culture in which being late/calling out is considered unprofessional and immature. And uncounsciously i became punctual with my everyday life (and thus manage it better).Culture is a double-edged sword, it gives and takes.


   Bearing all of this in mind i still hold my initial stance: If you have no diagnosis on a mental/physical issue or some of the secondary problems mentioned above that we all experience in day-to-day life, if you're constantly late because you genuinely don't care about other people's time or just do it for the sake of being late? Then you a mental midget.

1700069242.0,unpopularopinion,"Wearing PJ's out in public is weird and gross and shouldn't be as normalized as it is in the USThis is probably the most boomer opinion that I have, but it looks so trashy when I see people pull up to Walmart in their matching PJ sets. You don't even have to dress up nicely, sweatpants are perfectly fine, but you mean to tell me you rolled out of bed and came straight to the store? No preparation? You walk around the store and then go straight in to bed wearing those same clothes? Nasty.

Edit: to those saying ""why should I care"", because we live in a collective society. We have socially acceptable levels of formality depending on the situation. Funerals, Galas, Weddings, first dates, work conferences, nightclubs, dinner with extended family, hanging out casually with friends at a bar, all have an expected level of formality, to different degrees. At the very bottom is the baseline of being in public. It's not that much to say you should at least dress like an adult to go to target. 

When I see somebody wearing PJ'S in public, I think about it for a brief second when I see them, pass a modicum of judgement, and then move on with my day. In the same way if I see someone with a hentai sweater. Like damn this person has 0 respect for themselves but aight live your life.

SECOND EDIT: I have seen the errors of my ways by including Walmart. That was one specific example of a place in public that I've seen this behavior, but at this point, they can have it.

The revised degree of formality list is as below:

Wedding

Funeral

Graduation

Work conference

First date

Going out with friends

Going to the store

1692644094.0,unpopularopinion,"Letting cats sleep in your bed is disgusting, letting them walk on counters, and tables you eat at, is even worse.Cats walk around in boxes they shit and piss in several times a day. Letting them walk around where you sleep is disgusting, no matter how often you clean the sheets, and letting them walk on counters and tables is extremely unsanitary at best. 

I've had cats my whole life, still do, and they have never been allowed in my bed, and I close the door to the room when I sleep. They never jump on tables and counters because I've trained them not to, and I've never had a problem doing so.

Since people keep acting like it's absolutely impossible to train or condition cats, despite the fact that it very much is possible and you look silly, here's how to do it:

Starting young is best, obviously. Start by putting tin foil, and if that doesn't work use sticky tape, on your counters. They'll hate being up there. This way you're training them to not like the action of jumping up there, instead of the fact that they get disciplined. If you're only conditioning them with discipline they'll only learn that it upsets you, not that they shouldn't do it. A lot of people have said some variation of ""they just don't get up there while you're looking"" because they don't understand WHY my cats don't go up on my counters. They don't go up there because THEY don't want to, not because it makes me mad. Also, if you ever do have to scold or discipline your cats, make sure you do it right after the action, and please don't apologize to them afterwards. When I do have to scold my one cat for something he then tries to rub up against my leg, and I avoid letting him do so by moving my legs out of the way when he tries. He's not trying to apologize when he does this, he's trying to smooth things over, you need to show your cat it's not ok by not letting them do that. 

Edit: It's always hilarious to me that this opinion upsets people to such a degree that they post angry comments. Do whatever you want with your cats as long as you're not harming them. That's your business.

Edit 2: People calling me cruel for not letting my cats sleep in my bed look, and are, ridiculous.

Edit 3: People train tigers to jump through flaming hoops but seemingly 99% of you think it's inconceivable that you would be able to keep your 9 pound housecat off the countertops? Guys, you're just lazy and haven't even tried to train them, and that's ok, but get a grip.",2467,461,1
1690904976.0,unpopularopinion,"Phones are not why kids aren't going outside.I see a lot of people talkong about how kids don't play outside like they used to, or how they're spoiled on their phones, making posts like ""What did people do all day without the internet?"" People treat that as if outside is somehow now a foreign concept to younger generations, and often the blame is put on phones phones phones, the big evil cellphone. 

Now for context, I'm 21, and I grew up in the midwest, so I didn't have a smartphome until like 14 years old, and it was barely even a smartphone. Now, I personally think that blaming phones for the issue of less kids outside is just plain ignorant. I have two completely separate reasons for believing this.

The first being, the way I grew up. I grew up throughout the 2000s amd 2010s, the era most point to as ""the last time kids went outside and weren't distracted by those dang phones"". Now, I didn't have a phone for a very long time. But I did have movies, a PS2, and the internet. I have very fond memories of all these things, but I also know that among these things, I constantly went outside with friends. These were good distractions too, YouTube, and Newgrounds content. Still, we went outside a lot, and had to knock on eachother's doors to see who was available. 

The second reason is that people assume kids don't want to go outside. Personally, I see kids playing outside in my neighborhood all the time.. well, when it's not 105°F outside. Not even just in my neighborhood, I see kids and teenagers walking, biking, or skating all around here when I'm driving. People assume phones are some evil thing that's killing outside, but kids are drawn to the outside still. Outside has just become infinitely more uncomfortable, mean, and dangerous since I was a kid. So I don't blame them for staying inside a little, especially when they have the convenience to just text their friends to see who's available right off the bat, saving them a trip. 

Side note: I'm not trying to gloss over the addictive nature of apps like TikTok. I just know YouTube held a similar status in my childhood, and similarly, Vine did too. So I figured that's still kind of comparing apples to apples.

I suppose overall, the point I'm trying to make is, I don't think it's phones making kids not go outside. Technological distraction is not a new thing by any means, and kids still always went outside despite it. I believe there's just less necessity to go outside to see if someone's available, and outside has become increasingly hostile to young people. Thus, young people are going outside less frequently.",2610,464,1

My mom has red hair and my parents were scared I’d be a redhead because how rough my mom had it as a kid for her hair. Nobody called her by her name.

EDIT: Thank you to everyone who's commented! Even the assholes. Many of your criticisms are fair -- even enlightening -- and some I still disagree with. 

Where the assholes and I agree

- My original post was poorly written. I halfway expected it to drown in the torrent of new posts, plus the topic riles me, so I didn't choose my words carefully. Surprise, surprise: they didn't hold up well under the microscope of /unpopularopinion's front page. 

This is how I would reword its crux: ""not feeling like it"" is a shitty excuse to flake on friends. “Not feeling like it"" due to something foreseeable (you stayed up late the night before watching a football game, you had an important project due at work this week, you never liked the plans you agreed to) doesn’t make the excuse any better. If you're unsure if you'll make it, tell your friend that. Otherwise, flaking isn't self-care. It’s immature and rude.  

- Shit happens to everyone, and especially to parents and people with chronic medical conditions. 

- How someone flakes is relevant. A sincere apology can communicate what a casual cancellation doesn't: the friend who is cancelling still values the friendship.

Where the assholes and I disagree

- One said, ""We don't own our friends' time."" No, but we do owe our friends the time we tell them we'll set aside for them, unforeseen conflicts excepted.  

- Canceling because you don't feel like it right now can be shortsighted because how you feel can often change after you arrive.

- To be angry at a friend who flakes isn't selfish. It's a reasonable response to someone whose poor planning affects you.

- I’d rather my friends stay home if they're too tired to enjoy themselves. But if they're tired due to poor planning, being “too tired” is a shitty excuse to flake.

The rides themselves are just atrocious. Minimum wait times of 2 hours to go on a ride that lasts 3 minutes? If you look at the way these new rides are being built, 99% of the ride is just space for the queue.  
  
Now on top of paying nearly $300 for one day at the park (hopper pass), you have to also purchase $20+ passes to get on rides, otherwise you're going to waste your entire day sitting in a 3 hour line.  
  
We purchased a genie+ pass was just enough to get us on a few rides, the one attempt we made to get on a ride without the genie pass, we waited in line for 2 hours only to have the ride break down (of course Disneyland doesn't do rain checks unless you have a fast pass...)  
  
The nail in the coffin is that Disneyland doesn't really offer things that other amusement parks don't offer anymore. Their ride technology and themed areas are on par with places like Universal Studios (which is less than half the cost). Any edge they have on quality is completely diminished by the sheer amount of people and lines you have to compete with constantly.

""I don't want to walk to get groceries"" ""Texas is much too hot walk"" ""schools are too far"" etc etc...

First off, the whole point of a walkable community is your needs like a grocery store are right there. So, instead of going on the grocery store and loading up for a family of four once a week, you swing by the grocery store on the way home from work and grab something for dinner. It also allows food to be fresher and generally of higher quality since you aren't having to stock up for a week or two.

Also, the definition of a walkable community is that schools are of walkable distance OR connected by transportation. 

But also, professional city/urban planners seem to idiotically fundamentally misunderstand walkable communities. In Texas at least their definition is a bunch of expensive apartments with high priced restaurants and bars underneath. Which... cool... but that isn't walkable if you still have to drive 30 minutes to a grocery store or to school or to entertainment or to recreation.

Also many of these walkable communities seem to be designed to be as hot as possible, big cement buildings, huge parking lots, zero trees. Just by eliminating giant flat fields of cement and making sure walkways were adequately shaded, a-lot of summer heat can be mitigated. 

But it seems alot of Americans, and architects/city planners/urban planners, have zero idea what they are talking about in regards to walkable communities.",1621,269,1

A bit of background: I am subscribed to Amazon Prime, Costco, Max, and a local gym.

Subscription serves have been around for a long time, and no one used to complain. They just need to be worth their value to be worth it. For example, Costco has basically been a subscription service for decades. Yet you get your value in your subscription by the money you save by buying in bulk and all the sales. Another example of a good subscription service that has been around for a long time is Amazon Prime. If you are using Amazon frequently then it is worth it to have Prime for the quicker shipping.

The problem most people run into is when they are subscribing to services and not really using them. Which any person who is a normal adult can manage their money going in and out. 

When it comes to the streaming services, I much like this model over cable. I can pick and choose which streaming service I want to watch things from while not being subscribed to anything else.

Most people say Tobey's Spiderman is the best live action Spiderman, and Spectacular is the best cartoon Spiderman, but I come here to digress. Ultimate Spiderman from the disney show is far better than any other version of spiderman i've ever seen. I know this is a really bold take, but this is the correct subreddit for this I think.

Most people really dislike the Ultimate Spiderman show, but I love it. The jokes are all awesome I don't think a single one of them is particularly bad, most are funny. The overall plot gets better throughout the seasons, and I love the Spiderverse episodes and Ultimate Goblin. I think the finale was perfect for the show also.

Overall, when I see Spiderman, this is the kind of spidey I want to see. Funny, making jokes mid battle, breaking the 4th wall. Serious at times when the plot demands it. Tobey doesn't make good jokes and Spectacular isn't on the level of Ultimate.

Tom Holland's Spiderman had a lot of potential but unfortunately they were held back by the other Spiderman movie series(Sam Raimi's and TASM) so they couldn't do something like a Spiderman: The Sinister Six movie which is what I wanted instead of No Way Home

IMO the 2nd best Spiderman is probably Insomniac's from the Marvel's Spiderman games, but that might be because they actually *did* get to do the Sinister Six thing, and it's hard for me to rate only the character forgetting that part. Oh also, Ultimate Spiderman also has several episodes where the Sinister Six come together, and also has in my opinion the best version of Carnage so far. I also love some of the side characters like Nova, Power Man and Agent Venom(Flash Thompson in this show).

I understand why some people may disagree, as they've grown up with more serious versions of the character, but I prefer light hearted spidey 90% of the time, and the other 10%, the same spidey but serious, like in the part where Ben Reilly(Scarlet Spider) reveals Peter's identity to Doc Ock

Pastel colors are too cutesy(and have been ruined for me by a lot of internet artists who are bad people), and neon colors are too bright for me and are hard to look at. Shows like MLP, Kiff, and Bluey look bad to me, not just due to the lazy reused designs(in the case of MLP and Bluey), but because the colors used in these shows look too bright and/or overly saturated. The more muted colors from cel-animated stuff and a lot of digitally animated stuff from the 2000s(FOP S1, Ren and Stimpy, Danny Phantom, Animaniacs) look a lot nicer than most cartoons nowadays. Mind you, there are stuff I like the color palettes for that came out in recent years. Lupin the 3rd Part IV looks nice color-wise, and I enjoy the recent Dragon Ball stuff from Shintani recently(ex. Super: Broly), and that upcoming Ren and Stimpy reboot seems to be using colors closer to the original run(even if I wish the character animation was more expressive). The new SpongeBob seasons are well-animated, but they should go back to the S1 colors. Hell, I'd take S2/3 or the 1st movie colors over what we have. It's all my personal opinion, but yeah.

1708814648.0,unpopularopinion,"Git is needlessly complicatedGit is an extremely useful tool to use when working on any kind of project but for the last 19 years it's been used almost exclusively by software developers. Git is not inherently limited to software projects and can be used as version control for really anything that involves storing files on a computer. Version control software, such as Git, should be as commonly understood by everyday computer users as internet browsers and antivirus software. Git's learning curve is unnecessary and is the main reason why it is not used by everyone. 

Take the command line for example, open up an internet browser and search ""git tutorial"" or ""how to get started with git"". Every tutorial starts by explaining how to use Git's command line interface. I understand that entering commands into a terminal is not technically ""coding"", but to the average person, it looks effectively the same. It's a significant entry barrier that discourages people unfamiliar with the concept to put in the effort to learn it. No other software commonly used by non-software developers requires the user to use the command line for every task. Imagine having to type `word save report.docx` in a terminal window every time you wanted to save in Microsoft Word, or `google revert` to go back a page in Google Chrome. I cannot understand why it is still the default way to interact with Git when it could easily be made to be more user friendly. 

For example, I often use the program ""7-zip"" to compress and decompress files. 7-zip has a command line interface. If I wanted to I could type `7z a` [`file.zip`](https://file.zip) `file.txt` in a terminal window to compress file.txt. However, this is not the default method and does not show up on the first page of a google search. Instead, I can right-click on file.txt in my file explorer, scroll down to 7-Zip in the pop-up menu, and select ""7-Zip > Add to [file.zip](https://file.zip)"". Alternatively, I could use the user-interface that comes pre-installed with 7-zip and compress it from there. Both methods are intuitive and do not require any typing. I don't understand why it's not possible to commit by right-clicking on a Git repository open in file explorer and selecting ""Git > Commit"" in the pop-up menu, or to add a file to the git index by selecting ""Git > Add"". 

I am aware that Git comes pre-installed with Git GUI on Windows, but it looks like it was made in a day using Tkinter. There's no reason for Git not to include a clean, user-friendly graphical interface as part of its default package. I am also aware there are third-party programs like GitKraken that provide a intuitive user-interface. However, the average person is likely deterred before even considering searching for a third-party solution.

To me, Git has always had a strange aura of gate-keeping around it, where it seems intentionally kept needlessly complicated. While it's not difficult to use once you get the hang of it, the initial complexity is kept in to make those who use it feel smarter than the average computer user. 

It's a true shame that Git is not widely accepted as the defacto version control software. Instead, software for non-programmers often have their own built-in VCS. Imagine if Microsoft Office had built in Git support like Visual Studio does? You could create a repository for a class and manage versions for notes, assignments, projects, etc from Word or Powerpoint.

If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read my mini-rant. I'm sure you're all ready to tell me how Git is actually intuitive and I'm just a slow learner in the comments lol.

TL;DR Git is extremely useful tool for any type of project but its needless complexity makes it scary for people unfamiliar with software development to learn and use.

I can't find a reason why companies choose to artificially limit their stock with products that people can, and will buy.   
Be it the NES/SNES mini, physical collectors' editions for games, art books, dakimakura covers, or literally anything else. There is no reason to not simply offer those items  on-demand after the campaign is over, and if they have a high production cost, the company can just up the price to the point it becomes profitable to sell them, it's not like that's gonna stop the people who really want it.  
I also have a similar opinion on products that are no longer manufactured like old consoles, phones, televisions etc., but that's besides the point of this post.

Now we get to digital limited editions/pre-order exclusive content...  
This is just plain idiocy. It's not like they can simply add said things as DLC, no. They need to sell to you the ""exclusivity"" of having a couple extra lines of code in the game you bought. Or, just having a couple of PNGs that apparently constitute as an ""Art book"".

This is because the people who get said products actually helped the project that they backed come into fruition.

It's the way they can say ""It's thanks to you that we got this far.""

1708702177.0,unpopularopinion,"Ketchup is only good on brats and burgers.When it comes to ketchup, I've found that it just doesn't align with my taste buds unless it's paired with burgers or bratwurst. The sweetness of ketchup tends to overpower other dishes, and fries are no exception. While some may enjoy the classic combination of fries and ketchup, I find that the sweetness of the condiment masks the natural flavors of the fries, diminishing the overall experience for me.Moreover, the intense flavor profile of ketchup tends to dominate dishes like fries or meatloaf, taking away from the enjoyment of the meal. For me, ketchup is best reserved for burgers and bratwurst, where its flavor complements the savory elements of the meat. Outside of these classic pairings, I'll pass on the ketchup and opt for other condiments or enjoy the dish as it is. It's all about personal preference, and for me, ketchup just doesn't work with fries or meatloaf.Change my mind. Give me a recipe that will change my view on ketchup.TLDR; Ketchup only works on burgers and brats. Fries or anything else with ketchup on it sucks. I would like a recipe that will change my mind.

Ironically, they're their own boss but are being told what to do by the customer and market demand.  If they truly did what they wanted to do and it didn't align with demand they'd go broke.

There’s so much more to the country than just London. I’ve spent most of my life travelling around the UK and I think England ticks the boxes for most of the things people praise other countries for. 

You can get a surprisingly diverse experience as you travel around the country, and so I believe that most people can find something they like about it. 

Countless towns and regions have their own cultural identities, ways of life, dialects/accents, food traditions, architecture, and genetic makeup. There’s a varied mix of cities and towns- from charming historic to modern planned towns, industrial eyesores, etc. Anything you could possibly want. 

There’s a good mix of ancient and modern - interesting history is found on almost every corner spanning thousands of years that we can learn a lot of lessons from. But there’s also great nightlife, shopping, entertainment, developed infrastructure, etc.

The countryside is beautiful - lush green and tranquil. The number of walking/hiking trails is pretty remarkable and easily accessible, and there’s also an extensive rugged coastline to explore. 

The country just has a lot to offer and I shake my head at how the national image has been reduced to Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, football, and binge drinking whilst other countries receive praise for their range of culture, heritage, landscapes, etc.

I won't get into how I lost my teeth because it's embarassing and not the point of this discussion, so don't ask.

But anyways, at first it was gross but now that I'm used to it, I think it is superior than the normal method of consumption. It's less messy, you don't need utensils, and it's way easier and portable and it just tastes better. I no longer have to waste time eating breakfast, I can just blend it up and drink it along with my coffee on the way to work. Same for lunch and dinner. I don't need to carry a lunchbox, just a cup. I feel like it's easier to digest and I no longer have to deal with constipiasion, although I do admit that this diet does give me the squirts. That's the only downside. Still, the body does not need to waste energy breaking down the food, since it's already been broken down, therefore I have excess energy for other things like brainpower and muscle building. I'm not a sciencetist or anything, but just think about it, the logic makes sense, right? Anyways, I digress.  In summary, blended food is:

* more convinient
* easier to digest
* tastes better once you get used to the texture
* makes it easier to eat healthy foods you don't like, like brocolli and eggplant
* can mix with sodas and coffee, or gatorade if you're exercising and need energy

Some of my favorite shows like Bob's Burgers, the Simpsons, and Morel Oral have musical episodes, or devote time specifically for the characters to sing. It can be fun, especially if the voice actors can sing.  
  
That being said, there really should be less of it. There should be more adult animated shows that don't do songs every episode. Animated kid's shows/movies don't have to end in a dance party or sing to progress the plot. It seems like a factory standard to do it that way. (Especially in the West.)  
  
The Into the Spiderverse series is a great example of using music to enhance the experience. Miles singing along with the first song then not again for the rest of the movie was fun! It was a hint of his character, and we still got to experience the music! It's just one example, but there could be more that's done to keep music in without adding singing.

* He is humble and does not tolerate arrogance and bullshit. When everyone is bragging how badass the Death Star is, he brings everyone down to earth and remembers how it is insignificant in the grand scheme of things. And he was right.
* He is resourceful. He doesn't care about hiring bounty hunters, which the empire leadership considers ""scum"". He does what needs to be done to get the job done, and in that case, the job got done.
* He does not tolerate incompetence among people who were put in a leadership position. When he chokes the generals to death, it is not because of pure villainy. It is because his general's bad decisions put unnecessary risk to empire , like alerting the rebels the Empire is coming to Hoth (which required a ground assault, costing men's lives).
* He also takes the time to go personally to the guy who is building the new Death Star to warn him ""our boss is pissed,  you'd better go back to schedule"". He is a bro trying to help his buddy before it is too late.
* On the other hand he promotes individuals who are smart. Like the dude who read a strange signal from the probe droid which might have indicated the rebel base was in Hoth.

These carts are so huge that you can barely squeeze by them with a cart, not to mention the employees that stand by them who always seem to be oblivious to the people around them and are likely incentivized by some sort of time constraint to fulfill orders quickly. Between the employees gathering items and the regular shoppers trying to navigate around them, aisles become inaccessible for minutes at a time, and often there's an employee in each of the most trafficked aisles at any given time. One of the most annoying things though is that their mega tower carts are almost never full, not even close, so they could easily switch to skinnier carts, which would be a lot easier than the store widening the aisles.

It’s especially gross when someone does it right after eating. 

Nobody I talk to about this seems to understand why it’s gross. Maybe I’m being unreasonable but I grew up this way, and at this point if even my boyfriend drinks out of it without at least brushing his teeth before, I just get a new bottle. 


Edit: Just wanna say that I don’t find people who drink like that gross. I find the idea of it gross. I’m not judging anyone for drinking water the normal way lol. I’m just not accustomed to it and have been taught to drink in other ways (I’m pretty sure it’s a part of my original country’s culture)

Yes I drink out of glasses, it’s different cuz the water gets drunk within minutes, in a bottle the spit stays for hours. 

Yes, if you drink with your mouth on the bottle there will be backwash. I’ve always observed it.

No, I don’t find you gross if you drink that way. I literally couldn’t give a fuck. Just don’t drink out my bottle that way, and even if you do I’m not going to say anything to you, I just won’t like it

No this doesn’t hinder me in my life. If I absolutely have to, I will put my mouth on the bottle, or I will drink out of someone else bottle. I’m not gonna make a big deal out of it like a kid lol

1708469513.0,unpopularopinion,"Plastic Bag Bans Are Pointless: People Should Reuse Them InsteadHear me out. I strongly believe that banning plastic bags isn't the solution to our environmental problems. Instead, we should encourage people to reuse them.
Growing up, my family always reused plastic bags for various purposes, especially as trash bags. We never had to buy them. Now, as an adult, I've continued this practice because it's convenient and reduces waste. However, I've noticed a trend where plastic bag bans are being enforced, and it's not sitting right with me.
Sure, banning plastic bags might seem like a step in the right direction for the environment, but is it really? Think about it: if we ban plastic bags, people will just buy alternative trash bags, often made from thicker plastics, which can be even worse for the environment. Not to mention, you now have to pay for something that used to be freely available or included with your grocery purchase.I wish people would just reuse plastic grocery bags instead of buying plastic bags.  
The realist in me knows that people won't do this though

1708434681.0,unpopularopinion,"Elementary was not only a better show than Sherlock, but a more faithful adaptation of the spirit of the source materialProbably old forgotten news to most but basically there were two shows about Sherlock Holmes that aired at the same time, the BBC Sherlock and CBS (?) Elementary.
I watched most of elementary and tried to get into Sherlock but just couldn't. So my two cents on the matter is:

The episodic formula of elementary is far more faithful to the original Sherlock Holmes book series where most cases were separate and you can pick up and enjoy any book any time. While Sherlock to me felt like it's getting too convoluted with all the characters and over arching schemes in the background to fully just have the same feeling of ""oh this sounds like a more interesting case, I'll jump into that.""

Elementary also just felt like a more natural and believable setting for a modernized Sherlock Holmes and how a character like him will behave in the current world of police and detective work. It makes it more believable that in our times with how strict in procedure investigations are that Holmes will be brought as someone to bring an extra perspective, some interesting specific knowledge and not the police basically getting on their hands and knees like in the British version for Sherlock to degrade them look into it and say ""you absolute dafts, you jolly molly apes, he usually uses his right hand"".

And on a more personal lever, just in view of the genre as a whole. Evey detective and crime show always runs into the problem where the writers wrote themselves into a dead end and basically need to write in a hail marry, in Sherlock it was a boomerang in elementary it was just funny seeing Sherlock have to ""pay"" fo these kinds of things from hackers, added a nice twist of self reflection to it all",1824,324,1
1708413628.0,unpopularopinion,"Random encounters are better than field encounters in turn based rpgs.People hate random encounters. It's probably the biggest complaint people have about older rpgs (and has been a complaint for about as long as the genre has existed). Lately more and more rpgs are moving to having field encounters (also called symbol encounters) which happen when you run into an enemy on the field. I hate this trend and think it's a far worse alternative than the old random encounter system.  


With random encounters there's no way around them, and as such if the game's difficulty curve is well-designed and it's signposted well the developer can have a general idea of how many encounters someone is going to run into on the way from objective to objective. It might vary slightly from player to player, but by and large the developer can guess the average number of enemies a player is going to fight and around what their level will be and tailor the difficulty to it.  


With symbol encounters you have none of that. Since players can choose when and where to fight then do you balance around the player fighting every enemy or avoiding most combat? I don't like having to guess what the designer's intent is and whether they want me to fight everything I come across or just the occasional battle.  


It also totally strips out any kind of resource management challenge from gameplay. In older rpgs getting through a dungeon isn't just about beating the boss. You have to be able to get through the dungeon, defeat the boss and get out all without running out of resources (health, magic, healing items, etc). If you can just run past every enemy then that's no longer something that's really much of  factor in gameplay.  


You could argue that you can still have all these things by just creating field encounters that are difficult or impossible to avoid, so that way the player will still need to fight some enemies from time to time. But if that's the case how is that at all different from random encounters?",2015,351,1
1708410650.0,unpopularopinion,"“PM” or “Private Message” is a far better phrase to use than “DM” when messaging someone 1-on-1.A “PM,” or “Private Message,” is exactly what most people mean when they say “DM me” or similar. Private Messaging (PM) is a 1-on-1, _private_ conversation between two people on a messaging platform.

It makes no sense at all to tell someone to “DM” you when there’s more ways to directly message someone than to privately message someone. The most obvious way tagging the person in question on a social media platform. “Direct” does not mean “private,” so tagging someone in, or commenting their name underneath, something like a meme or post you enjoy is “directly” messaging, or “DM”ing them, just as much as starting up a 1-on-1 chat is. 

We should bring back “PM” as the way to say we’d like to communicate 1-on-1, as it has a much clearer meaning (privacy) than the broader “DM,” which can be used to just draw someone’s attention to an item of interest regardless of it being 1-on-1 or on a public forum for all to see.

1708405117.0,unpopularopinion,"The 2024 NBA ASG was not as bad as people are making it out to beI keep seeing posts online about how the nba all star game was boring because no defense was being played as usual. I’d argue the game was so boring because the East was shooting the 3 ball much better than the West. The defensive effort started off acceptable for the ASG. 

When the game first started, the starters looked liked they were putting in effort on defense. First score of the game: Giannis attacked the basket guarded by KD, Lebron moves over to help, Giannis passes it to Tatum in the corner for a wide open 3.

From there on, both teams were playing  defense when the players were set. Transition defense (fast breaks, half court passes straight from throw in, cherry picking, etc.) are where the players were lacking and that’s understandable for the first quarter of an ASG.

The issue was the 3 pointers. Players on the East started taking and making impressively difficult 3s. The defense by the West definitely wasn’t their best but it’s not like they just stood around and watched. A lot of the shots the East were taking are shots that would be ill advised in a regular game. The West accordingly, weren’t playing the defense seen in a regular game.

And by the second quarter when the East was leading by like 12+ points. Anytime the West went on any sort of run, someone on the East went and made a 3 to kill the momentum. That’s when the defensive effort started to drop significantly and it became a joke. It essentially became another 3 point contest. Players aren’t going to go 100% down 20 in the third quarter for a game with little to no incentive. When they do try like KAT did, they get clowned online.

Matter of fact throughout the whole game, KD put in the most effort on defense. He also probably had the most points scored on him. I can recall like 5+ times where a player on the East iso’d with KD defending and made a 3 over him.

People are recalling the 2020 ASG but that game isn’t comparable because of the circumstances. The game was competitive in the fourth quarter because both teams had a shot at winning it. 2024 ASG was over by late second quarter.

TLDR: The problem with the ASG has less to do with defensive effort and more to do with the 3 point shooting and spacing of players during the game.",2315,427,1

Since library books are shared property, some consider it kind of sacrosanct and that you should do your best to keep it in the same condition you checked it out in. 


I generally agree, but I think that marking up a book actually can enhance it in some ways. Notes in margins can provide extra context, references for further reading, etc. Underlined sentences can help the reader pay special attention. 


Since it's essentially communal property, this makes for a somewhat communal reading experience. I'm pretty sure some e-book apps even do something similar, like underlining a portion and telling you that lots of other readers have highlighted that.


I'm not even necessarily saying this should be like an official policy change. In my opinion it's cool, and I think there can be concrete benefits to it.  


It also creates a sort of shared history with previous readers, which can go back decades. Almost like being in an anonymous book club, just connected by the library and the book.


I would also say this is mainly for non-fiction, it would be distracting for fiction. But I only really see it happen in non-fiction, particularly older books which I'm guessing are often marked up before the library even gets them. ",1445,248,1

With that being said, setting up a Curry vs. Ionescu 3-pt challenge was a joke. Not only are we comparing apples and oranges (WNBA balls are smaller), but this feeds into the false narrative that ""WNBA players are just as good as NBA players and deserve equal pay"" although they generate a deficit because they still believe that they could fill 20,000-seat arenas.

What's more, Kenny Smith (I believe it was him) commented on Curry's win by saying that ""Ionescu should be shooting from the WNBA 3-pt line, that would make it fair."" What a joke. The WNBA refuses to lower the rims, yet they use smaller balls, and now this comment. The hypocrisy is beyond me.

I'm glad that Curry eked out the win. Could you imagine the endless WNBA gloating had Sabrina won?

1708332525.0,unpopularopinion,"The concept of blasters being “uncivilized” and lightsabers being “civilized” is dumbLet’s look at it from an IRL perspective. If someone wanted to have a fight, and the option was a long sword or a colt 1911, which one would you say was more civilized? Brutally stabbing someone to death and cutting open their stomach, or shooting them in the head and instantly killing them?

I get the logic, lightsabers take an incredible amount of skill to wield effectively, same as a long sword. Just like a long sword, a lightsaber has multiple styles of fighting, while a gun and a blaster are point and shoot. But I don’t think using a melee weapon to painfully kill someone is more civilized than shooting them and killing them quickly and efficiently. Taking a lot of skill doesn’t make something civilized.

But when has that *ever* worked? So, first and foremost, it's wrong because it's ineffective and impractical.

Secondly, it's wrong because we have to realize that that person holds that view because they were either raised to believe it or were brainwashed by YouTube/Facebook rabbit holes. Therefore, what they experience is, to them, an unwarranted attack and the fear and anger that comes with that. So, even if it *were* an effective tactic (ie, to shame them for their views), going about it by attacking, frightening, and angering them is *certainly* not a viable, 21st century option.

Third, it's wrong because people that hold views that are morally opposed to our own *may very well* have something to teach us--about them, their views, why they hold those views, or even something about ourselves. By shaming or insulting them, they will naturally close up and attack back, thereby ruining any chance for an opportunity to learn from one another.

1708280785.0,unpopularopinion,"Movies where the bad guy dies at the end are unsatisfyingThey're only satisfying if you believe there is some sort of punishment after death. But if you don't, and instead believe nothing happens after death, then there never is any real justice. And even if you do believe there is some form of justice after death you almost never get to see that on screen, you just have to make it up in your head. 

Sure, often times the bad guy has a painful death where they realize they've lost but that lasts a few minutes at most and more often than not they don't go through nearly as much pain as they've caused to others.

Take the movie Unhinged with Russel Crowe for example (spoilers ahead). This guy murders multiple innocent people in brutal awful ways, traumatizes dozens of others, and devastates countless families. His punishment at the end? Stabbed in the eye and a fairly painful death (although not nearly as painful as many of the on screen murders he did). He never really has to face what he did and see the pain he's caused. Nope, it's just lights out forever for him.

I want to compare two other movies that essentially have the same plot but with different endings. Those movies are Misery (1990) and Run (2020). Both pretty good movies imo. There are plenty of differences between the two but there are also obvious similarities with Run taking plenty of inspiration from Misery. Again, spoilers ahead.

In Misery, a crazy lady stalker fan holds her favorite author captive for months after she finds him in a car wreck. She drugs him, keeps him crippled, keeps him locked in his room, and inflicts severe trauma on this poor guy for months. Oh, and she murders an innocent cop trying to help. She's a deranged lunatic who does awful terrible things to innocent people. Her punishment? A realization she's lost and a fairly painful bludgeoning to the head. She never has to face the things she did and the pain she caused. I'd much rather she live at the end, get arrested, stand trial, get psychiatric help, return to sanity and have plenty of time to think about the awful things she's done as she rots in prison.

Now let's look at Run. Again, crazy lady holds someone captive, this time her daughter (whom she kidnapped at birth) and this time for nearly two decades instead of a few months. She drugs her daughter to keep her crippled, shelters her from ever having a social life, and as soon as her daughter realizes what's happening she locks her in the basement, tries to poison her and threatens to kill her. She psychologically and physically tortures this poor innocent girl and devastates the family she stole the baby from. Oh, and she murders an innocent mailman trying to help. She's a deranged lunatic who does awful terrible things to innocent people. Her punishment? Unlike Annie from Misery, she lives at the end after getting shot and taking a wicked tumble down some stairs. She gets arrested, she stands trial, she gets psychiatric help, she gets the rest of her life to think about the awful things she's done as she rots in prison (well a maximum security mental hospital but close enough), and most importantly she literally gets a taste of her own medicine. Her daughter frequently visits her and its revealed that each time she visits she drugs her mother with seemingly the same drugs that her mother used on her for years, keeping her paralyzed or whatever. The bad guy faced real life on screen consequences for her action that are just as bad if not worse than the pain she inflicted on her victims. She didn't get a few seconds of pain and a free ticket to oblivion for eternity. And because of that it was a more satisfying ending for the audience imo.

A few things I want to note:

1. This is not an opinion piece on what ""true"" justice really is. I know I used a lot of eye for an eye examples in this but that's only because that's the most common type of ""justice"" used in movies and the only ones I could think of. I don't really care how the writer chooses to portray justice, I just don't like when it's the same old trope that's been used a thousand times where I'm supposed to be satisfied that the bad guy is dead. Any form of justice other than death is a breath of fresh air in my book.
2. I'm not a movie critic and I'm not here to argue about the movies I talked about. Maybe I'm missing what the ""real"" message is in these movies but I don't care. The parallels I made are the only ones I needed to make my point. I'm also not saying any of these movies are bad, I enjoyed all 3 but some endings are more satisfying than others.
3. I'm not here to argue about religious beliefs either. If you believe someone gets what they deserve after death then great, I'm sure you're very satisfied when the antagonist dies. I just personally don't believe in that so death isn't seen as a punishment to me since I don't think experience is possible once you're dead.
4. This logic applies to books, tv shows, any story really, and even real life in certain instances. 

TL;DR: Bad guys don't face real consequences or justice if they simply die in the end because death isn't an inherently bad experience. It's probably not an experience at all. And it's much more satisfying when the bad guy faces real life consequences for the terrible things they've done.",5313,963,1

Over the course of the first two seasons, Viktor has done a lot of bad shit, like a LOOOOOOOT of bad shit. Let's see... he's destroyed the world twice, tried to upset the timeline by bringing people from the '60s to 2019, etc. And what does Allison do in response to all this? Nothing. Absolutely. Nothing. She *cares* for this man. It's something that's been apparent since the first season. Even when he slashed her throat in season 1, she gave him no ill will and even asked Luther to release him from the basement (he didn't end up doing it).

Enter season 3. For most of the season, Allison's as supportive of Viktor as she's been the entire show previously. And then episode 6 rolls around. Allison finds out that Harlan, who Viktor was trying to free from his powers, unwittingly killed all the Umbrella Academy's mothers before they were born (except Ben's). In a rage, she kills Harlan, and then, not completely satiated yet, decides to take every last *shred* of her anger out on Viktor, the guy who did nothing wrong, at least not knowingly, and also the guy who she's been nothing but sweet and kind to over the course of the last three seasons, in episode 7. _This is the only noteworthy thing she does the entire episode._ And then it gets worse. In episode 8, Viktor genuinely apologizes to her for everything he did wrong (read: literally nothing), and asks for forgiveness. And Allison, in an act of the BIGGEST CHARACTER DERAILMENT I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE, openly tells him that she can't forgive him for this, by comparison, *little slight,* when she's been MORE than happy to forgive him in the past. THAT is my problem with Allison. It's not a problem with the characters. It's a problem with the writing. Allison's villain arc was written poorly. That's about the long and short of it.

Unless you have a specific allergy, spicy food doesn't make you ill, the amount you're jamming down your gullet does.  Which leads me to my next point.

1708245492.0,unpopularopinion,"Caffeine pills are a superior alternative to coffee and energy drinksOver-the-counter caffeine pills are a much better option than coffee and energy drinks when you need an energy boost throughout your day.

First, there's the price. A single cup of coffee from a cafe will cost you at least $5 or more. An energy drink can cost $2 to $5 depending on what you pick. On the other hand, name brand caffeine pills cost about $10 for a box of 60 and generics are even cheaper. You can get an equivalent amount of caffeine as a cup of coffee for less that a quarter.

Second is the calories. Caffeine pills have zero calories but energy drinks are loaded with sugar and most drinks you'd find at coffee chains these days are essentially coffee-flavored desserts. One drink recently made headlines for having 1,200 calories in a single cup. That's a major source of extra calories in your diet, especially if you habitually drink these every day.

Third is the convenience. A blister pack of caffeine pills can easily fit in a desk, glovebox, purse, or jacket pocket and you can forget about it until you need it. It doesn't require you to take time out of your day to go to a cafe, stand in line, place an order, and wait for a barista to make it and serve it to you. It's just ready immediately.

I say this is an unpopular opinion because nearly every time someone at work has commented to me ""I feel so tired right now"" and I offered them one of my caffeine pills that I had handy, they would recoil and look at my as if I had just offered them hard drugs (I would show them where it says ""CAFFEINE 200 mg"" printed on the package).

I realize that people say they enjoy coffee for the taste, which is understandable.

When everything is on every platform it incentivises companies to produce software in a cheap and effective manner, that allows it to be spread thin over multiple sets of hardware.

You cannot get a game that will run on every piece of hardwell well, because it then does not take advantage of the properties of said hardware, it needs to cater to the lowest common denomiantor. 

Software pushes hardware sales. Simple as that. Would it be great if we lived in a utopia where everyone could play every game on one piece of hardware? Sure, but essentially the only reason we've ever had good software outside of passion projects is because investors will willingly fund software that is better than the competition to attempt to push their own hardware. This is an objectively good thing that creates good video games.

Some of the shittiest games are slapped onto every piece of hardware through 6 different development studios porting the game poorly, because now it's not about making a piece of software that's so good consumers want to buy the hardware to run it, it just becomes a marketing game about selling as many copies over the entire market as possible.

If you're out here fighting exclusives, and shitting on them, you're actively hurting the industry and helping to kill good games. Competition is literally the most important thing for large investors to want to invest into making good products.

And also since the moment manufacturers have been adding more than one camera, their phones have gotten much and much uglier and impractical:

In a 2018 financial report, Adam Silver admitted the league had lost an average of $10 million per year ever since it was founded.  Since then the league has started to turn around. The average viewership per game has doubled in that period and , the total revenue reached over $200 million a year. A few individual teams, have even started to become profitable. However despite these great strides, the league as a whole still loses money and has a long way to go before it becomes ingrained in our culture similar to other pro sports leagues. 

Despite 3 decades of disappointment, there is absolutely hope that the league can turn around. That hope is Caitlin Clark. 


This season, playing in college she is averaging 32.8 points per game for the University of Iowa. Next highest scorer in all of woman’s college basketball is averaging 27.7 ppg. Brittney Griner, who is in many ways the face of the WNBA, never averaged more than 24 ppg during her college career. 

So it’s clear Caitlin is dominate, but the question is, if she can really bring in enough viewers to change women’s basketball forever. The answer is a resounding yes. 


So far this year, the average WNBA game has brought in roughly 500k viewers. Last season when Iowa played Louisville in March madness the game sustained an average viewership of 2.49 million. It not just her play off games that are bringing in viewers either. A random regular season game this season against Ohio maintained an average viewership of 1.93 million. Think about that.

Iowa is shattering attendance records this year as well. The very first game of this season, Iowa broke the NCAA women’s basketball attendance record, selling 56 thousand tickets
Every road game they have played this season has been a sell out crowd. In all but two of their games this year they have either broken an attendance record or sold out the arena. Crazy.

1708029523.0,unpopularopinion,"The A24 Green Knight movie is not only bad but also completely gets the original story wrong.The poem of ""Sir Gawain and the Green Knight"" is a favorite of mine. I love Arthurian literature, chivalric romances, and fantasy movies. How people AT ALL compare the A24 movie favorably to the original poem is mind boggling to me. I can't stand that movie.

An absolutely critical part of the original tale of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is how virtuous and chivalrous Sir Gawain is. He is absolutely regarded highly in society at his time, he's very proper, very polite, and very respectful. He has no lady in waiting, and when the Lord's wife tries to tempt him in the manor, he politely and artfully declines her in ways that would not only stops the potential cheating but even does so in a way that would preserve the standing of him, the lady, and the lord.

It's ONLY when she tempts him with the green sash that would protect him from the Green Knight's strike that he falters in his virtue - AND THIS IS THE POINT OF THE STORY! Even a great and noble person can falter in their virtues in the face of death. When the Green Knight's strike doesn't cut off Gawain's head and the sash is revealed, he comments on this and doesn't blame him for the fear that death puts in men. Gawain is humbled and shamed, and the knights of King Arthur's Court wear green sashes of their own to humorously rebuke Gawain and remember to bring more honor to themselves in the face of death also.

The A24 version of the Green Knight makes Gawain completely and utterly unable to rise to any form of virtue or redeeming qualities. Not only does he get into petty fights and drinks constantly, but he HAS A LADY. Her being a prostitute does not remove the fact that a woman loves him, and he ACTIVELY cheats on her at the first chance he gets with the Lord's wife. She doesn't even need to tempt him with the sash, she JERKS HIM OFF and gets his CUM on the sash. Like an actual CLOSE UP of his CUM on the sash. How people can look at that and say that is ANYWHERE faithful to the original story is so impossible for me, I have tried to see from another point of view and I physically cannot.

That A24 movie is so disrespectful to the original story to me that I can't stand it. How it got rated so highly isn't really that surprising to me, it's very much shot for a modern audience in my opinion. BUT. I love the Northman too, and The Northman shows Amleth completely following the virtues of his people very well - pillaging, murdering, and revenging included. If The Northman can show a viking be a viking, why can't Sir Gawain follow HIS virtues and be a knight, and be chivalrous and respectful?

1708026278.0,unpopularopinion,"Medical imaging is not overused, but actually the oppositeMany health issues can be detected by high-quality medical imaging, yet the medical field often treats imaging as a last resort, with more fear about the possibility of ""unnecessary"" imaging than concern about lives and health.

Ultrasounds can provide fast and portable imaging for routine screenings, and MRIs are the gold standard for diagnosis of many issues. Neither produces radiation exposure like an X-ray or CT scan. I think every medical practice should be required to have on-site ultrasound for increased efficiency (subsidized by the government if necessary), and that there should be walk-in MRI clinics with minimal wait times.

It's considered normal for cancers to be detected only at an advanced stage, when outcomes are poorer and more advanced facilities are required. Only a small fraction are detected by currently routine screenings, and many are detected after many 'checkups' only when an unrelated accident sends someone to the ER.

We are willing to have colonoscopies to screen for colon cancer, but not a routine liver ultrasound to check one of the most common destinations for aggressive metastatic cancer and damage from metabolic issues, both reversible if caught early enough.

MRIs can detect heart and blood vessel issues and identify some people at risk of heart attacks, heart failure, strokes, and atherosclerosis – a massive number of people – for proactive treatment.

Over 900,000 people in the US have pulmonary embolisms each year, over 100,000 fatally. These blood clots most commonly start as a DVT elsewhere before traveling to the lungs after up to 4 weeks.

One common argument is that imaging will result in unnecessary invasive treatments, but the image itself does not. It is the responsibility of the radiologists and other specialists to make a sound judgment based on them. If there is truly a problem to the point that we should stick our heads in the sand about everything so that doctors don't overreact, the problem is those doctors, not the imaging. Patients having 'anxiety' about findings is also not a valid reason to systemically avoid lifesaving medical screenings. We might as well abolish all routine checkups for the same reason. Most other arguments against more imaging revolve around ""cost-effectiveness"" – the idea that $$$$$$$ is more important than lives.",2387,381,1

My concern is over a trend where people seem to think it can be prioritized over other commitments with no consequences.

A couple of things in my life recently have got me thinking about how there seems to be an attitude of entitlement among a lot of people to  travel to resorts in locations like Cuba, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, etc. every winter (speaking from a North American perspective). 

A close friend is a teacher. He says that every week there are 2-3 students out of school for all inclusive resort vacations. That is incredibly disruptive in an already strained school system. The parents use the excuse that they can’t afford the higher costs of travelling during scheduled time off or that they don’t want to go when everyone else is. To me, this is very selfish. It affects not only their child’s education, but also the whole class since it is basically a revolving door. When I was a kid, it was rare for a anyone to miss more than a day or two for an optional vacation, and it was usually something more exceptional like a family wedding or something when they did. I think my family only did two purely recreational vacations in my childhood and everything else was visiting family. I travelled way more than many of my classmates, and it was always during scheduled breaks. 

My other experience is a bit less serious but still bothers me. I participate in a team sport. While it is recreational, it is the type of sport that if people are missing it ruins the practices, and it is actually quite dangerous. At the start of the year, we all made a commitment to attend practices and competitions, obvious exceptions being if you’re sick or injured (though if you can, you show up and watch) or if there is a work related thing you can’t get out of. Then right in the thick of the competitive season, every week someone (and sometimes 2 people!) was gone on a vacation. Add a couple of people who were unfortunately sick, the practices were ruined for everyone else. We had the practice and competition schedule in September. I planned a vacation during a scheduled break. I feel it is unfair of my teammates not to do the same.  If leisure travel is so important to them, then maybe they shouldn’t commit to another recreational activity that requires attendance. 

I recognize other factors are at play (airlines jacking up their prices based on demand, social media causing FOMO). And it is ok enjoy vacationing, but I’m finding the attitude towards it is becoming very troubling.",2708,477,1

Corn, any sort of chili, multiple cheese types, corn, multiple bean types, onions, tomatillos, corn, tomatoes, a meat of some type like chorizo, taco seasoned beef, taco seasoned corn, carnitas, or even chicken. Don't forget, you can also layer in your favorite hot sauce or salsa.

Yk that advice people give? “Just be yourself” but what is “being yourself”? Just doing like you always do, right? Like when you are with close friends or family. 

But now Im thinking that what they call “being yourself” is simply a pattern in behaviour. Im not English so Idk if I said that right. But what I mean is that we all, since out first social interaction, have chosen to act a certain way. E.g. laughing when people mock us, trying to please people, being the sunshine in the group or the one with low energy. 

And after that first social interaction we simply continue to act that way. We repeat the same behaviour all the time till it becomes part of us. 
If one was always giving to friends and never talked bad about anybody others would say “thats just who they are” and when they say “be yourself” they are asking you to act the way you usually act.

But we can break that pattern if behaviour in seconds. Im more of a introvert and sometimes feel socially awkward but I can now go outside and act as if Im some celebrity and behave with absolute confidence. It will not go smoothly, it won’t feel natural but if I keep behaving that way for 3 months straight I can assure you that people will start saying “thats just how he is”

My point is “being yourself” is not TRULY yourself. Yourself is probably when you’re alone in your room dancing to your favourite song. Or crying your eyes out when you’re sad. Expressing yourself without problem. 

If “being yourself” is not real then it doesn’t matter if I start acting like a celebrity or if I do like my introverted self bc its all patterns of behaviour. 


TLDR: when people ask you to “be yourself” its not truly yourself but a pattern of behaviour repeated to much it has become part of you. If its just pattern of behaviour its not truly ourselves since we can break the pattern in a matter of seconds and act a different way.

Tom Brady—who is undoubtedly the greatest quarterback to ever play the game, took that all-star team and led them to the Super Bowl.

I’ve lived here all my life so I know how weird the weather can be. We were supposed to get a bad Nor’easter today that ended up being severely downgraded overnight. Predictably, there were the usual comments and memes about how “weathermen are the only ones who can be wrong and still have a job”, calling them idiots etc or even that they were fear mongering for whatever reasons. I even heard a gas station attendant tell me the meteorologists “have no idea what they’re doing.”

Snowfall amounts can vary greatly from the central part of MA where I live to Boston and RI/Southeastern Eastern MA towards the coast, roughly a 60 or so mile radius yet people here still expect absolute perfection 100% of the time. I’m sure the same applies to the weather in many other regions as well. 

 Most of the time the weather predictions are spot on, and the day to day/weekly 7 day forecasts are usually very accurate as far as predicting temperatures, sun & clouds. I highly doubt you’re looking at the usually forecast and making all your plans despite what the weather stations are saying - It’s usually just the occasional storms than get more media coverage and can be difficult to track that people notice and complain about when their plans get disrupted, especially when they think it was all “for nothing”.

1707850859.0,unpopularopinion,"Xbox losing exclusives is fineOkay so obviously theres been rumors lately about the direction of Xbox given the big announcement this Thursday but I wanted to share my view and thoughts/how they've evolved.

At first I thought there'd be no reason to continue to buy an Xbox over the Playstation? Why lower the available catalogue of games available if I can play most/all Xbox games on Playstation but not vice versa?

Now my view is starting to shift, especially given the economy and how expensive life is nowadays. 

Even if the Xbox releases their exclusives or majority of first party games over to Playstation, its still possible to remain an economic advantage to have an Xbox + Gamepass. If a multiplatform game is available on Xbox and Playstation, if Xbox releases it as a part of its gamepass catalogue its still a positive as you'd not have to pay full sticker price of $70 for a game. So imagine rather than having to pay $70 each year for the new COD or whatever, it'd be including with your gamepass membership which also includes your Xbox live. Thats still something that could appeal to a good amount of folks.

Obviously this would be upsetting to some, and rightfully so, but I don't think its the absolute end as some people are making it out to be. In fact, I think it could lead to a hybrid of folks purchasing a Series S, to cover the gamepass, and then use PS5 mainly just for exclusives. 

I'd love to hear your thoughts, but as a person watching their money nowadays I'll still probably grab a  series S as it could prove to be the budget friendly option...

1707803471.0,unpopularopinion,"Dating doesn't teach you anything meaningful about the other person - hanging out does.This is for people who are ""dating with intention"" and are serious about finding their person. If you're a casual dater or just looking to have a good time - have at it.

For individuals serious about finding a long-term partner, traditional dating methods like activities, dining, and social outings often fall short of facilitating genuine connections. Whether you're doing something exhilarating for a first date or more traditional, all activities tend to showcase the best, most polished versions of ourselves, not the authentic, everyday realities. This approach is performative, and rarely pierces through the veneer of social personas to reveal the true nature of each other.  
  
If your goal is to establish a meaningful, lasting relationship, it's time to reconsider the emphasis on outings and activities. Instead, focus on creating opportunities for in-depth, personal interaction in more intimate settings. The real test of compatibility extends beyond shared hobbies or enjoyable outings; it lies in the ability to connect on a deeper level, discussing personal dreams, vulnerabilities, and values without the distractions of a public setting or activity.  
  
My own experience underscores this point. We've been married 10 years and still going, we have 2 kids, and we go out regularly now - it was beautiful out here in central Florida this past weekend. But in the beginning, we hardly went out at all. I invited her over to my place actually, and our chemistry was intense - and it's only gotten better over time. We went at it right away. We had spent about 2 days talking on the apps beforehand. Once we got intimate, we got real with each other. We shared our secrets, our traumas, our histories. We got vulnerable quick and it set a tone of authenticity right out of the gate.

We spent our time together almost like a FWB situation at first - but it felt like more than just sex to both of us. It was backed by intense intimacy. We let the hormones rage for the first couple months - and yeah we went out here and there too like normal people. But we both always wanted to end things early and head back where we could enjoy one another fully. We're still this way even now.

We both agree, meeting in this way allowed us to bypass the superficial layers typical of early dating activities. Our immediate chemistry and open communication about our lives, histories, and secrets fostered a profound connection from the start. This level of intimacy and understanding is impossible to have on any other kind of date no matter how exciting it may be. In fact, the more ""exciting"" it is, the less you two are actually bonding because of your chemistry and compatibility, and more because you're just doing something fun and exhilarating. Here's the difference I guess. That exhilarating activity? You could have enjoyed that with someone you weren't attracted to just as much as someone you were attracted to because it's the activity itself that was enjoyed - your date's company surely enriched it, but it didn't define it. But you know what you can't do with just anyone? Have an authentic connection. You can't force a romantic or intimate connection. It's either there or it isn't - so find out sooner rather than later.  
  
In essence, dating with intention demands a shift from outward, activity-based interactions to inward, personal exchanges. This approach not only accelerates the process of getting to know someone but also lays a foundation for a relationship built on authenticity and mutual understanding. Traditional dating ISN'T working. There's a loneliness epidemic, most people have numerous negative experiences with dating apps, and there's less people getting married and staying together than ever before. We've lost the plot, and focus too heavily on the superficial then wonder why we're left feeling empty and disconnected with others.  
  
Emphasizing personal interaction over social activities is not just practical; it's a more efficient way to gauge long-term compatibility. It saves time, emotional energy, and resources, allowing you to quickly discern whether a relationship has the potential to thrive. By adopting this strategy, you're not only more likely to find a compatible partner but also to establish a relationship grounded in genuine connection and mutual respect.

Whether you had a good time playing darts with someone, felt the rush together of getting through white water rafting, went on a nice stroll downtown, went out for drinks, had a nice meal together, threw axes... none of that will inform you of if this person is a good life partner. Because when you go to describe your partner, you're not going to list off all the activities and hobbies you have in common, you're going to list off their qualities. You'll find those qualities out quicker, more sincerely, and less performatively in a much more intimate and private setting than you ever will sharing in an activity that you could enjoy as much with a friend, family member, or stranger, as you could a date.

Connection is what we should all be seeking. Shared hobbies are important, but whether you both like to read historic romantic fiction or not should not be given the same weight as how understood do you feel on a deep level. Activities are too often used as a heuristic for connection when in all actuality it just means that you both like a thing. You shouldn't base a connection on liking a thing, you should base it on whether you like each other. Cut out the ""thing"" and focus on each other - ditch outings for innings, and you'll find someone you actually enjoy being with instead of spending your time figuring out whether you even like this person.

During conversations with them, the second I say anything about NASCAR at all, I'll get hit with the ""NASCAR is just rednecks going in ovals for hours!"" line. Cue the endless jokes about NASCAR from people who, quite literally, haven't watched an oval race before. (Side note, I'm pretty sure they have no idea NASCAR does road courses too.) If you think about it for more than two minutes, complaining about the ovals not a good argument.

The whole point of these motorsports is competition; it's what makes racing fun. We watch motorsports to see drivers duke it out in their cars, employing various strategies to wrangle for first place. We root for our favorite racers as they compete at breakneck speeds. And, regarding this, the track itself becomes less important. 

It's like if I watched an action movie where two characters were duking it out and having a great fight scene, and then I complained about the boring set. The set doesn't matter, it's the fighting and action that matters.

You'll see action, you'll see passes and overtakes, and you'll see battles like you do in F1. In fact, you'll arguably see more action, as drivers are allowed more contact, and the ovals pack them in together more, causing more passes and overtakes.

But these last couple of years they’ve gotten way worse. They either call so many fouls and ruin the game, or they barely call any and the players are getting mauled. When players are getting mauled, usually one team gets way more calls than the other too. Plus they love to call techs for some pretty asinine occurrences. Like staring somebody down, yelling after a dunk, clapping the backboard. The worst are the double techs when some players get into “and altercation” which usually is just a stare down and a few words.

I think the lamest part of all this is that nobody has beat anyone’s ass for stepping out of line. The referees are so ready to call techs nobody sticks up for themselves, and as a result, you get this bullshit game of “trying to bait” other players. 

I don’t want to see players getting hurt, carried off the court and being beaten up badly. But it’s so much pent up aggression that’s all taken out in passive aggressive ways. You should be allowed to defend yourself in a dignified manner when somebody is trying to punk you.

Often, they ironically speak over the actual victims and catapult whatever story they can get their hands on into a public forum that it desperately does not need to be in. And the people responsible for the consequences of these escalatory actions are rarely held accountable.

There is a reasonable limit to schadenfreude. We often participate when we believe that people won't actually get hurt. But a myriad of studies have shown that verbal abuse is equivalent in the brain to physical pain. When it crosses the line, people become afraid to call out those who don't have that limit. I believe that the people who do this have empathy, but I also believe that they cannot stop this pattern. That gut feeling that you have, that somebody might be going too far; listen to that.

And that same hatred and rage can silence victims as much as it can silence perpetrators. Too many stories have been rejected with such absolute ferocity that the claimant loses their confidence, without anyone even bothering with whether the story had merit. We dispense with the necessary elements of due process that underpin our legal system online in the hopes of protecting those who have been harmed, without realizing that those same elements were established to PROTECT those who have been harmed.

1707675411.0,unpopularopinion,"Almost all actors nowadays are completely interchangeableThis has been something I've been thinking about every now and then and I will try to explain it the best way I can so try and bear with me. To start, here are some common phrases that don't really make any sense to me:

""xx actor's performance was phenomenal in that movie and deserves an Oscar""

""I hope they cast xx actor for this upcoming movie""

""I love movies with xx actor and will watch it just because he/she is in it""

Now the reason the above doesn't make any sense is threefold:

* The goal of an actor is to get you completely immersed in the story
* Almost every actor in Hollywood now is extremely skilled in accomplishing this
* Any added performance/acting skill once the threshold to get the viewer immersed in the story has been crossed is irrelevant

Let's use one scene in a popular (I think?) movie as an example: Owen Wilson's reaction when his dog was dying in Marley and Me. It was a very sad scene, especially for dog lovers, but I would argue that almost any actor in Hollywood would have made us feel the way we felt during that scene. Let's say for example that the skill required to take us from ""actor playing a character that had his dog die"" to ""actual person losing his dog"" was like a 6/10. My argument is that almost every actor in Hollywood nowadays can achieve this and that anything higher than 6/10 is irrelevant. Once we are immersed in the story and our brains are properly ""tricked"" to see what we are seeing as ""real"" then any level of actor skill above a 6 would not make much of a difference for us. It wouldn't have mattered if instead of Owen Wilson we picked an actor that spent his entire life dealing with the deaths of dogs. Once they cross that 6/10 threshold to get the viewer immersed in the story, no one will notice anything else above that.

Another way of putting this is that it's very hard to notice how great an actor's performance is once someone is fully immersed in the story. I have no idea how ""amazing"" the acting of Daniel Radcliffe is in Harry Potter when he's experienced a devastating event. All I see is a teenage boy dealing with death. You could have replace Radcliffe with any of the similarly-aged actors in Hollywood at the time and again, all I would see is a teenage boy dealing with death. If anything, I would have to un-immerse myself from the movie to start critiquing their respective acting skills, which would take away the entire point of watching a movie in the first place.

So to close this out, I think we are very lucky to live in a time where almost every actor has the skill to get the viewer lost in the respective story they are trying to tell and once that immersion is complete, it doesn't matter how much better their acting is and frankly, it doesn't matter at all what actor you choose to play that role.",2863,529,1

Mocked them, threatened to kill Gohan in front of Goku, clothes-lined people, no-sold attacks with a grin, knocked them out of SSJ and still whooped on em,  dragged them through buildings, used Goku like a trampoline, etc. He didn't just mindlessly scream as if he'd been a feral child his whole life. Dude was a straight villain, just fun to watch. Super Broly hands down has the better animation quality and fight choreography in most regards, and Vegeta's frustration/desire to flat put Kill Broly is better than the almost immediate helplessness he expresses in the original. But what makes the original Broly and movies like Super Android 13 special are when the Z-fighters all fight together against a Boss, rather than Vegeta jobbing for a few minutes before Goku steps in to wrap things up. (Goku, Trunks, and Gohan turning SSJ together still goes hard, and we get a cold af entrance from Picolo when he saves Gohan.)

And the 90s/early 2000s hard rock tracks are just fun.

Broly's characterization in both films is still barebones Shonen two dimensional writing; his motivations in Super don't have any more depth, they're just a bit different. Daddy issues and an uncontrollable berserker spirit isn't the Grade A writing people make it out to be when comparing it to the original's, ""FUCK this weak dude for crying so much""/PTSD from what happened. 

Also, Broly being able to even keep up with Super Saiyan God(s) and a non-SSJ Gogeta (not to mention whoop a Golden Frieza for an hour) is just kinda silly, considering what Goku and Vegeta had gone through vs Broly only training with his underpowered dad.

I haven't seen anyone suggest \*making content\* about a hobby or area of interest, which I have experienced to be a really efficient way to meet people.

I met two women this way and one guy that I was friends with for over a year.  
If you start a hobby, especially as a man looking to meet women, you're just another schlub with a hobby you're probably not very good at, because you just started.  
When you create content, even if the account is small (a few hundred or thousand subs/ followers), you position yourself as an authority in the hobby or interest, which automatically confers status.

I don't care what sport it is you watch, allowing 10-12 players/teams to make it into the playoffs is BS. It means close to half the teams in a given league have a shot to get in, and makes the entire regular season borderline pointless. 

You can be the best team in the MLB, make the playoffs easily, and get swept in the divisional by a team that couldn't win for shit earlier in the season. In NASCAR, it's even worse. 16 out of the 40 full time drivers make it into the playoffs. That's nearly half the grid. Not to mention racing can sometimes be decided by pure luck. It's bullshit

My solution, simple. For something like NASCAR, use the F1 points system. The best driver at the end of the year is crowned champion.

And for the NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, etc, Use a record based format. The team in each confrence (NFC/AFC, NL/AL) play in the championship game, be it the Super Bowl, or the World Series. If you want to crown a deserving champion, this is how.

I can see where that would be friendship-ending if your friend knows your ex was abusive or if your relationship ended on bad terms, because you would expect your friend to have empathized with your plight and written your ex off as a bad person. But you can't feel betrayed without some deep emotions and expectations. So I don't understand why someone would feel betrayed about a friend dating an ex if they didn't have unresolved feelings about that relationship. 

I also don't understand why people have such a big problem with their partners having exes as friends. There can be specific suspicious people in your partner's life, but if you think talking to an ex at all is unacceptable I think it says a lot more about how you might react to and feel about an ex than it does about your partner's loyalty. But even if you did assume that someone might feel some type of way about their ex, why would the solution be to ban them from interacting instead of just breaking up with your partner? If someone would be willing to cheat on you or leave you because of their ex, they clearly didn't see the commitment as a commitment. Is someone who isn't responsible, considerate, and trustworthy enough not to cheat on you/leave you for an ex really someone you want to be legally, financially, and socially tied to?

First off, freedom. Picture yourself cruising down the highway, wind in your hair, no restrictions. That's the kind of freedom you just can't get on a packed bus or train.

  
Convenience is a biggie too. No waiting around for the next bus or train – with a car, you're the boss of your own schedule. Need to make a quick stop? Just hop in your car and go, no waiting necessary.  
Privacy is another deal-breaker for me. With a car, you've got your own space to do your thing without prying eyes or unwanted company.

  
Safety is key. I feel way safer driving in my own car, especially in dodgy areas or late at night. Plus, I can choose the safest route and avoid any potential trouble spots.

  
Time is precious, right? With a car, you're not stuck waiting for multiple transfers or dealing with unexpected delays. You're in control of your own time, plain and simple.

  
Independence is everything. No more relying on public transportation schedules or begging for rides – with a car, you're calling the shots.

  
Now, about those giant highway systems. Some people might see them as eyesores, but not me. I see endless possibilities. Giant highways mean endless adventures, from coast-to-coast road trips to exploring new cities.

  
Sure, cars have their downsides – traffic, maintenance costs, environmental concerns – but for me, the freedom, convenience, and independence they offer make it all worth it.

Some of the most beloved producers and artists aren't that great in terms of dexterity and technical skill. Look at someone like Kurt cobain, Smells like teen spirit is just 4 basic power chords. Something most beginners can pull off.

People accuse Jimi hendrix of being sloppy, or that Anthony Kiedis cant sing worth shit, but I dont think any of that matters. What matters is that it sounds good. Kiedis in specific is open about the fact he never even took singing lessons until Californication, LOL... After 15 years or so in the band. But who cares? The music sounds good. We listen for the sound, not the technical ability, and those 2 arent always the same.

Nobody besides people who are super into the technical side give a damn about who has the best pitch control when singing, or who can play the best guitar in terms of dexterity, or any technical skill for that matter. All that matters is if it sounds good... If i fiddle around on a piano without knowing any keys or any music theory, and find something that sounds cool, then thats all that matters.

Lots of older rock bands didnt have much of an idea what they were doing, theyd just fiddle around until they found something that worked. Music theory people try and reverse engineer it and figure out WHY it worked, or why it sounded good, but the person making the music rarely even thinks of it.

I liken it to a book, WHAT youre writing about is far more important than your ability to articulate, grammar, etc. Fact is, alot of the beloved icons can just translate a specific feeling into a sound, and own it very well. Plus, like a proof reader, we have things like pitch correction, and many other audio tools to correct imperfections. All that matters is if the end product sounds good, not what the artist's technical abilities are.

Another example is Eminem. Technical skill-wise, he's better than hes ever been... Wordplay, honed in flows, and just overall ability, he is phenomenal. But fans yearn for his older work, Eminem show, MMLP, SSLP, etc. because it sounded better. It was more interesting, better topics, and just had a better sound, despite his technical skill being worse.

In every YouTube video, sometimes the music is louder than the narration or it is just downright terrible. These YouTube creators don’t get that I am trying to watch the video for the INFO they're offering, not to listen to their bad choice of music. If I want to hear music, I have my own playlist that I go to, and only if I am in the mood for it.

Music is in stores and shops. People play loud music in their cars. Or you are a passenger and the driver is playing music you would never ever listen to. You can’t close your ears so you’re trapped listening to awful or deafeningly awful music until you’re done with watching the video, shopping at the store, passing by that car, or making the driver turn it off. I was staying with a friend and she played her music really loud all day while doing some cleaning. Too bad I don’t have a remote where I can turn off the music people are playing.

Impossible to go anywhere in civilization without hearing music. I can’t avoid everyone and stay indoors with beautiful silence or music I enjoy. I can’t live in the forest and off the grid either. Way too much music is being played without regard to my permission, personal taste, and preferences. Before electronics were invented, people had to play live music to hear any. You could actively avoid hearing music by not going to a concert. Or go if you wish. People just sat inside their houses in silence or had a conversation. How exquisite for them.

Edit: The dental clinic where I go to has a giant TV screen playing looped music in the waiting area. Then you go and get treatment where the radio is on thru the loudspeakers in every room. Inescapable at this point. Headphones and earbuds are uncomfortable for my ears and can give me a skin rash.

Additionally, the booming of AC III’s cannon fire gives successful shots an impact that neither of the later two games achieves. Successful broadsides feel too arcadey in those games, whereas AC III’s broadsides lend themselves a powerful presence that’s complemented by the staggered fire rate, volume, and impactful effect.

You bought a game 20 years ago. You took good care of that game. It's been in your home, which has not been flooded, on fire, or through some other extreme event which would damage the game. You spent money in utility bills to help keep that game in a climate-controlled environment. You carefully took it out and put it back into it's case each time you played it, and there are no scratches or scuffs on the cartridge or disc. You finally decide, ""Alright, I need some extra cash, let's sell that game."" You look on eBay, and it recently sold for $20.

All of that time, energy, money, and dedication to preserving a piece of history for $20. (This is me and my 23 year old, pristine copy of THPS for Dreamcast.)

 I also personally like his singing style better too! he could rock out, sing slow ballads, etc... his voice could sing just about any style.

It gives you a bit of extra routine and structure if your games are the same day every week, gives you something to look forward to during those days where life feels like a slog, and also gives you a healthy sense of accountability to others.

In those decades, conservatives would edit out violence, cultures, sex, drugs, and moral issues in tv shows and movies as a way to make sure that these shows were safe for the audience. In reality, it made them worse because audiences knew what was going on in these show and didn’t find the censored versions enjoyable and went to piracy and gatekeeping in order to search for the uncensored versions. People who saw the uncensored versions of these tv shows and movies then took action to rise up against the censorship of their favorite shows and movies and demanded the ones in charge to stop their conservative way or face the consequences. One example would be the Children’s Television act of 1993, which was made by Peggy Charen and she made sure that all tv shows and movies be censored for broadcast tv for the masses and that cause the rise of cable tv as a way to get away from the censorship.

1707346840.0,unpopularopinion,"Princess and the Frog was the last great Disney animated movie.EDIT - This opinion does not include Pixar or any other studios that Disney has claimed! Only the main Disney animation studios.

Edit 2 - Just for clarification, the disney animation studios movies that i am comparing Princess and the frog to are : Tangled, Winnie the Pooh, Wreck-it Ralph, Frozen, Big Hero 6, Zootopia, Moana, Ralph breaks the internet, Frozen 2, Raya and the last dragon, Encanto and Strange world. I am not comparing it to any Pixar films like Inside Out, Coco, elemental, etc.

Also this is not me saying these movies are bad in any way, they are still very enjoyable and i still watch them! I just think PATF is the best one! 

Original post:

As the title says, I believe that Princess and the Frog was the last great Disney animated movie. And no, it's not just because it was the last 2d animated one (though that definitely influences my personal ranking of it). I just don't think Disney has reached the heights of PATF since. The music is one of the biggest reasons for this; the songs in that movie are so full of love and really represent the setting, and the singers they got portray the characters and stories they're trying to tell so well. The story, although just an adaptation of another fairy tale, really speaks to me. The way they changed Tiana's character from a spoilt princess to a hard-working woman trying to open her own business \*Chefs Kiss\*. She's also the last Disney princess who has a somewhat unique personality. Most that followed have the ""adorkable"" personality, and I'm tired of it now. Finally, the visuals are just so lively and beautiful! Anyway all that said, Princess and the Frog is amazing and nothing else has topped it since.

Some honourable mentions for movies that almost reached the heights of PATF:

* Moana - I enjoyed the songs that represented Polynesian music, and Moana herself was at least less ""adorkable"" than the others, but the story was a little empty, and the ""villain"" (if you can even call it that) was just part of the twist villain trend in Disney so I felt a little disappointed.
* Tangled - The story was good but Rapunzel was the beginning of the ""adorkable"" trend, so looking back at her now she just melts in with the rest of them. Music was great though, very theatre-esque, if not a little pop-musicy in some songs. Also, the world just felt a little lifeless, which is probably due to the fact that it was 3d animated, and they still weren't really used to that yet as they had only done about 4 3d animated movies beforehand, and they all looked a little.... off.",2623,468,1

There is a reason why Microsoft has one of the biggest net worths for any business in the world. Microsoft knows what it's doing. Microsoft have some of the best executives, financial advisors, and business minds in the world. Microsoft would only be doing this if it means that Microsoft is going to make more money. And when PlayStation and Nintendo figure this out PlayStation and Nintendo will follow suit soon after and start making some of it's exclusive games available on other platforms. PlayStation and Nintendo are also going to do this, because Playstation and Nintendo want to make more money. 

Also Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo barely make any money from selling consoles. Actually there was a report in 2021 where a Microsoft executive has admitted that the company doesn’t earn any profit on sales of Xbox consoles alone. That's because the profit margin for consoles is so thin...almost non existent. Microsoft makes there money through many different ways. However on the Xbox type of income it comes from gamepass and games...not the consoles. 

Microsoft is setting the new trend for gaming and is looking at the future of gaming which is game sales, game services, and streaming games. 20 years from now powerful consoles aren't even going to exist. Games will be streamed through devices like the Fire Stick, Roku, Google Chromecast, TVs, and PCs. The companies will probably come out with their own streaming devices also.",2015,337,1

It seems like the moment they start branching out into live recordings, fan events, or video streams (especially ones with fan participation), they begin turning into ego-projects and quality goes down. Too much reliance on fan-service, inside jokes, or descent into caricature. Either way. quality suffers.

Another factor trigger for this happens with shows that consist of host(s) that research and discuss a different topic as the focus of each episode. Lots of these hosts are really good researchers and do good work communicating this info. But, there seems to come a point where they (and their audience) start to mistake their ability to research for expertise (or just general ""wisdom""). Enter the ego issues.

To a large extent this is a result of fans elevating the hosts to a level that they aren't prepared to handle. You don't know these people, no matter how much they share with the audience. The various ""scandals"" from the past couple of years with uber-popular personalities should have taught fans to not obsess, but it keeps happening.

The Eastern Barred Owls are expanding their range into the area. They have a more flexible diet and reproduce more vigorously than the area's native Northern Spotted Owls.

I always hear people say how bad it was but they never give a definitive area of flaw or say anything that would make it better. 

There wasn't much wrong with the movie at all, some of the animatronics looked a bit clunky at times but the only real problem was that the villain (William / purple guy) had no real screen time. In any good movie the villain always has a good motivation for being the bad guy and they need actual time to BE the bad guy. 

Basically the movie had neither of those. William had all of 5 minutes of screen time before he died. The villain also needs to be in the movie as much as the main character because without them there isn't much of a story.
Also they need proper motivation for wanting to be the bad guy. I follow fnaf lore decently closely and even knowing all of that the motives in the movie were really unclear, like why did he kidnap Mike Schmidt's brother? Just for the funny? Then there's the whole kids in the suits, but that makes sense from the game lore standpoint, but what about the people who don't know the lore, their probably ao confused thinking this movie's constantly pulling stuff out its ass.

If they could just make the villain have more screen time making him do bad things to make him seem more like an actual threat, it would even make the ending of the movie feel more climactic than it was. In the end it felt way too fast and really rushed.

Apart from being vague (I've seen ""Mature"" be interpreted as ""my kids in 5th grade, he's mature"") it also doesn't technically restrict you. A 12 year old can buy an M rated game if he can talk the employee into it, and it won't break laws as far as I know except corporate laws.

Movie theaters require ID for R rated movies. Children under 6 aren't allowed at all. This is standard at every movie theater chain. Movies aren't interactive, they're static. You only *watch* the psycho murderer. Video games are inherently worse, as you *are* the psycho murderer. 

My opinion is that the ESRB should be replaced with age numbers on a game by game basis (5+, 12+, 14+, 18+, 21+, etc) based on the games content instead of lumping it into categories, so anyone who buys it knows *exactly* what they're getting.

Lets start with the first claim I made, mentally unstable. This man was so far gone, only around 3-4 months into the apocalypse.

Aiming a gun at this best friend’s back, simply because he wants what his friend had. He assaults Lori at the CDC, kills Otis in cold blood.

I see a lot of “walkers only go after live bait” stuff online as justification. Lets say Shane had to shoot Otis, ok, fine. But he could’ve shot him in the head and left him for dead. Proof? The walkers ate Nicholas even after he shot himself in the head.

Shane is mentally weak. He got so attached to Lori that quickly that he would aim a gun at his best friend to take her back from him.

A lot of things he said, or wanted to do made sense. Walkers in the barn, Randal, etc etc. but Shane didn’t do this for the safety of the group, he simply wanted Lori and Carl for himself, he didn’t give a damn if anyone else got hurt, unlike Rick.

Rick was mentally stronger and more prepared for the apocalypse than Shane himself. 

“Sophias dead sophias dead, stop looking for her blah blah” and yet when she actually IS revealed to be dead, who shoots her? RICK FUCKIN GRIMES DOES. Shane wasn’t mentlaly prepared to take that shot, he isn’t about that life.

Oh and before anyone says “Rick in season 5 is just like Shane” do you not realize that that’s the point? Rick became a bad guy for a moment. And he soon realized that he went about it the wrong way at first. Season 9 Rick is what Shane wishes he was.

So, in the new Suicide Squad game, Batman gets shot in the head by Harley Quinn. This is the Arkham Batman portrayed by Kevin Conroy. The same Batman that we spent multiple games playing as. The invincible, body smashing, ass whooping, unstoppable force that practically cleaned out an entire literal city worth of people. Just handling business. Well he got caught, tied up, and shot in the head by Harley Quinn. 

Everyone is so pissed that he was disrespected that way. It was so anti climactic. How could Batman die with a bullet to the head? With all that he’s been through, a fucking bullet to the head. 

But that’s the beauty of it. It kind of reminds you of his humanity. Throughout the Arkham Series, the character becomes larger than life. You’re invincible. You become a literal super hero, impossible to keep up with, always prepared for anything, just an unstoppable force as you barrel through impossible odds. We do so much that we forget that Batman is not in fact Wonderwoman or Superman. He’s a regular human being. Just as normal as you and me. That shot to the head reminds the audience that this human being was able to accomplish so much. Everything we did was by a person. It adds a little bit of awe to the character.

 It’s like seeing a world class boxer win a title only to find out that he beat cancer 5 years earlier. He becomes an inspiration. All the sudden, you want to try more. Batman could do it, why couldn’t you? He’s pushed the envelope and shown us how far the human condition is truly capable of. If Superman died, there’s a disconnect there. He’s an alien.

For example, take his “fight” with Kreese at the beginning of Karate Kid 2. Kreese literally went full force with his fist, Miyagi evaded and Kreese broke his knuckles on the windshield. Then… HE DOES IT AGAIN! But not only that… Kreese falls on his knees without even trying to fight back or escape when Miyagi threatens him.

Each time, they come with with a strike, Miyagi counters, and then they’re all stunned, letting Miyagi finish them off. Even Kreese’s mini fight with Miyagi in KK3 was an embarrassment.

In the first 45 minutes of the show, six contestants play a variety of games that are entertaining to watch and what really makes it great is that you can play along with the contestants. 

  
The showcase showdown, nothing happens. They just show a bunch of prizes, and then the contestants have to guess a price. I mean I get it -- basically the entire show is contestants just guessing prices but it's done in a more entertaining fashion. There is zero entertainment value to the showcase showdown where the contestant just stands at a podium and says a number. But this is the show's GRAND finale and what the whole thing leads up to. It's a pretty disappointing finish. 

The showcase showdown is basically the equivalent of what contestants are doing to earn their way on stage, just with significantly more valuable prizes. To earn your way on stage, the show is basically acknowledging ""this is not entertaining, we'll make this go real fast, and then the real fun begins when the contestant gets on stage."" 

Then they do the showcase showdown and they're like… ""yea you know that really boring aspect of the show that we run through in 5 seconds throughout the whole show? We're going to turn that into our grand finale."" It makes no sense. 

Rather than having two showcases, they should just have one, and the two finalists need to participate in some sort of pricing game against one another for a chance to win the big grand prize. Maybe the person who guesses the most correct prices of grocery items in a certain time span, gets the grand prize.

I get that it's exciting to get a shiny new thing in the mail, but with so many minimum-viable-products out there it really does a disservice to other consumers to only post reviews when the item is brand new.

Not really


But do I also think people could see more the importance of mental fullfillment in more of their endeavors?

Absolutely!


If you just do everything because you want to chase the ""riches and the rags"" and want to have a big name to yourself or a sense of ""seniority"" then you're missing the point of even chasing success in the first place


Fullfillment is important, just as important as having a good work ethic and being very ambitious about things


But I think fullfillment is more important for your mental acuity simply because is what helps create long lasting satiation and a deeper sense of achievement 


Superficial success may lead to success, but it can also lead to a very bleak, empty void

Celebrities supposedly on average suffer from more mental emptiness & bleakness than the average joe, that's right there the proof in the pudding that having a big net worth to your name isn't always the key to long lasting happiness and contentment

Is being intentional with your drive about things

1706786036.0,unpopularopinion,"You don't need to play a game X hours, to say you don't like it.There seem to be a lot of people, that try to invalidate a negative opinion about games they like by saying: ""You didn't play it long enough, so you can't judge."" I think this is complete nonsense. Probably every gamer has already looked at a game trailer and thought: ""I don't like this."" You don't need to play X hours to know if you like a game or not. Sometimes just hearing about the setting and genre can be enough to judge. Sometimes gameplay trailers can be enough. Sometimes an hour of trying the game can be enough. Sometimes it takes 10+ hours to make up a mind about a game. But it's up to the player to decide, when he's seen enough, to form an opinion about a game. And it's stupid to try and invalidate others subjective opinion, because they did something, you yourself do all the time, too.

Why should anyone keep playing a game past the point, where it isn't fun anymore? Even if maybe the game could become fun at a later point, why should I play the unfun part to get to the point, when I just as well can play another game, that's fun from start to finish? 

If I boot a game up and in the first 10 seconds I notice, that the font is for ants and I don't want to sit right in front of the TV, while playing this game, just to be able to read anything, than it's valid for me to dislike the game even if I only played 10 seconds.

It's all about subjective opinions and preferences. Everybody is an expert on his own preferences, while others are not. So who am I to question, if somebody tells me he did or didn't like game X?

This argument is just an instrument to dismiss an opinion people don't like. I've read the following conversation in another post, that I write in a simplified way. 

Person A: ""I don't like this game""

Person B: ""You probably didn't play it enough""

Person A: ""Ive actually beat it""

Person B: ""Well if you've beaten it, you must have enjoyed it, or else you wouldn't have played so long.""

This boils down to:

Short playtime = invalid opinion

Long playtime = you enjoyed the game

So apparently the only valid opinion is, that Player A enjoyed the game. And even if you say: ""Ok, but it's a difference between playing a game for 10 hours or beating it."" Yes of course it is, but the logic behind those arguments is so arbitrary, that you can just apply one of the arguments to any given playtime. It's just a tool to confirm a bias for some people. Because apparently they like the game so much, that it transcends them. They like it so much, that everybody in the world has to like the game to. That's why they need to invalidate negative opinions about the game, even though they are opinions completely subjective to the person. 

The same thing also exists in the opposite direction, where people hate a game so much, that it transcends them and everyone needs to hate the game. But that's another topic. 

Long story short. People are free to form their opinions about games however they want. It's their subjective opinion, so they set the rules. No matter how much they played a game and if they liked or disliked it, all the opinions about a game are equally valid. So please stop this ""YoU DidN'T pLAy LoNg EnOuGh!""

Baseball was invented in 1839. Because of this, the sport has changed a lot over the years. Every single era is different because of the way MLB players have been developed over the years.

Back in the early 1910s, there was a player by the name of Ty Cobb. He definitely would not have been able to survive the live-ball era. And this is someone who won 12 batting titles. 

Then, there was Babe Ruth. Babe Ruth dominated the 1920s and early 1930s. Most people would call him the GOAT of baseball. However, a lot of people say that he would not have survived in today's MLB.

Then, there was Ted Williams. The best player in the 1940s and 1950s. Many people would argue that he was the GOAT of baseball. However, the MLB was still not to where it is today, and I'm not sure if Ted would have been able to adapt to how the pitchers can manipulate their pitches.

Then there was Pete Rose. The best player of the 1960s and 1970s, and the hits king. Baseball was beginning to become a lot more like it is today, however, he bet on baseball and slept with a minor. I am not sure that many people would be ok with someone like that being their sport's GOAT.

Today, there is Albert Pujols. He hit 3,000 balls for base hits and over 700 home runs. Should he be the GOAT? Some people think that his lack of advanced stats could be a strike against him.

Because of this, I think that the ""GOAT of Baseball"" does not exist. Or at least is a debate that is harder to have.

Especially from guys, there’s this common refrain of “not wanting to be seen as a creep” which compounds the “anxiety about approaching someone” thats existed long before modern dating habits. That line itself is a big red flag to me, because generally speaking, humans aren’t bothered by the mere idea of a stranger speaking to them. But a stranger showering them with compliments then asking them out? Well, thats another thing.

So many people seem to miss the distinction between “approaching/hitting on someone” where your introductory conversation is you feeling attraction, making a pass, hoping the other party reciprocates instead of establishing mutual attraction first. If you ask a barista out because you felt a connection when she did her job duties by being kind to you, that’s unlikely to work. But if you think you feel a little connection, go back to the shop and notice that the cute barista takes an extra minute to chat with you, does something “special” for you, then you’ve got a chance!

I see so many people these days complaining about failed situationships as if they broke up with their life long partner. I find it very silly that you would be so upset over someone who never wanted to make you two official.

To me it just feels like using people like some kind of tool, like how you use a toothbrush to brush your teeth to look/feel better until you need to replace it. 

It feels kind of greedy to want everything a relationship can offer, but without the actual commitment. And the worst part is people don't realise that it's not as innocent as it may seem, a lot of them are genuinely being used and mistreated and it hurts to see most of the time. I think a lot of these situationships are the result of one partner never saying what they actually want out of this.

I just wish all these young people had more self respect, because it hurts seeing them suffer from all these unfair relationship dynamics.

I do believe that a casual relationship like this can work out if both people are consenting to it. My problem comes from situations where one person wants something more, while the other doesn't - this is why I said it seems a little greedy to me. Greedy because sometimes people who want something casual usually take advantage of more insecure people who might not speak up for themselves and just accept whatever mistreatment comes their way, while still feeling obligated to act like they are fully committed.

I don't think outright banning fast foods is right since people should have the right to make unhealthy choices in their diet, but when it's cheaper and easier to buy some processed meal vs buying some fresh fruit and veg and preparing your own meal then I think society has a problem.

My solution would be make it illegal to advertise fast foods and the price should be dramatically increased to make it unworthwhile for people to eat such food on a regular basis, while the government should also make a signifcant effort to make the healthy foods more affordable for the average people. There should also be money invested into educating people more on what a healthy diet looks like and basic everyday recipes which they can use.

If you watch a reel now, you may not be able to talk to me about it tomorrow, but if you see the same reel months later, you'll know you already saw it.

The issue is, your brain has limited power. The power it spends to do all of this isn't spent doing more important things like thinking of solutions to issues, processing emotions and other quite important stuff, leading to people being less able to handle their issues.

This isn't saying technology usage is always bad, but it's wrong to consider it relaxing. If you want to truly relax your mind, take a walk, do mild exercise, listen to music or consume content that is slower paced like a book or a movie, content that isn't designed to cram as much information and entertainment as possible in a short time window.

1706521149.0,unpopularopinion,"Many legal services are a complete waste of money**Disclaimer:** I am writing this in Australia, from an Australian perspective. If you are in the US or UK things may differ.

This is coming from someone who has completed a law degree at a top 50 global university with very high marks. On graduation, I was placed in the top 5% of the graduating class, which is most likely better than most lawyers you have met or dealt with. I also have worked at an elite global law firm. I say this because it helps me establish credibility, in a world where everyone seems to hate on lawyers for no reasons or for completely the wrong reasons. 

My unpopular opinion is that many legal services are a complete waste of money. 

Most people think that law is a complex discipline, involving lots of reading, dissecting complex legal judgments and understanding intricate theories formulated decades ago by judges and academics. Law school may be like that to an extent, but legal practice is essentially administrative work. In most commercial areas, you are essentially filling out paperwork.

You will either be a ""transactional"" lawyer or a ""litigation"" lawyer. Either way, your job will involve classifying documents, completing documents, conducting due diligence and drafting documents based on pre-existing template. 

These are not complex tasks. It is simply administrative work at the end of the day. The system, whether intentionally or not, makes it difficult for laymen to navigate.

The simple sale of a property or a criminal law matter is made so much more daunting and complex due to inadequate systems and processes which are clunky and not user-friendly. 

I am not saying that legal services are useless. I think that a lot of the time, they are overpriced. This particularly applies to lawyers and law firms that charge by six minute increments (a very common practice here in Australia). A lot of top law firms will employ graduates and associates to do work that a law clerk could do, which is billed at a higher rate. Even a senior associate sometimes will charge upwards of $500 an hour - a complete waste of money if you ask me. 

Law firms have gotten too comfortable with charging exorbitant prices to corporate clients and personal clients. ",2258,381,1

The current trend in smartphone design leans towards rounded corners, which, while aesthetically pleasing to some, doesn't provide the same immersive experience that a square-cornered, rectangular phone does. 

The square shape, with its sharp corners, gives the impression of looking through a window onto whatever you're viewing on your screen.

 It's a subtle difference, but one that significantly enhances the user experience.

Imagine if they made a proper sequel to Episode III. How badass would the tension, death-star battle, and untimely death of Obiwan be? We could also see more of Anakin hunting Jedi - maybe even fighting Ahsoka. We could see Anakin mourning Padme. We could see the tension between Anakin and Palpatine.

Auto insurance costs a fortune and part of it has to do with the high cost of repairs.

To help reduce the cost of insurance, minor damage to bumpers (and maybe other areas) should not be actionable as a lawsuit or an insurance claim.

I do not understand why reality tv gets so much hate. It’s simply entertainment. Participants are hired to entertain an audience. What’s so wrong about that? Every point I’ve heard made has been completely nonsensical.

“Haha, it’s all scripted anyway!”

Most aren’t. Some, like “The Hills” are more scripted than most. But usually, production will give the cast an idea, and the cast runs with it on their own. Even if it WAS scripted, who fucking cares? Doesn’t ruin the entertainment value for me. I am inclined to believe it’s more real than not, because often the participants embarrass themselves, get arrested, get others pregnant. Strongly doubt anyone would go to that extent for a reality tv show storyline, to ruin their own reputations, if it weren’t their real actions. 

“It’s pointless. All these people fight over nothing. They contribute nothing to society.”
Yeah, then so is football, basketball, all sports. A bunch of people fighting over a ball, that has no real impact on society, just entertainment. 

“Reality show participants are a bad influence on younger people. People will see that and think it’s ok to act like that.”

Then so are violent video games, and we know that argument is false. 

“Reality show participants are the scum of society. They have no talent.”

A bunch of sports players have DV charges too, don’t take care of their children, cheat on their wives, list goes on. Most aren’t particularly intelligent either. And reality tv participants do have talent- the talent to entertain, to maintain audience interest. Whether one thinks that’s valuable or not is up to them. 

“People only watch reality tv to feel better about themselves and judge other people.”

And the fatasses watching sports, giving their opinion on every player, every play and referee call, aren’t?

“They’re exploiting personal drama for money!”

And they get paid pretty well. It’s a job like any other.

Reality tv watching a hobby like any other.

If an employee doesn’t want to come into work because they want to take a “self-care day”, that’s seen as perfectly justified even if they’re not using PTO or sick leave. Managers are expected to make exceptions when they have rules to follow and a business to run. Employees who back talk to managers are fully supported and even encouraged. 

If a customer asks an innocent question about “merchandise in the back” or some other question borne more out of a lack of knowledge than malice or entitlement, employees who respond to them in a rude or harsh way are seen as totally justified and even righteous. If a patron doesn’t neatly arrange their dishes for a waiter, then they’re an asshole. 

Businesses have an obligation to pay you a fair market rate for your labor. They don’t have an obligation to pay you for existing.

You might say, well, most people don't steal, murder, rape, etc. But everyone is taught that those things are wrong from birth. They're socially disapproved. There are legal consequences.To determine if people have a conscience, you have to see how they act about an extreme injustice that's socially accepted and legally permitted.

What is an example of that today?

I'd say the #1 example is having other animals tortured and killed for taste pleasure. In most of the Global North, we don't need eat animal flesh or products. Pigs, cows, and chickens feel pain just like us, and are very much like dogs and cats. What is the justification for causing extreme suffering and death? What, someone wants a tasty sandwich for like 10 mins?

Everyone knows about the meat industry. It's 2024. Animals are caged, electrocuted, gassed to death. Even when everyone knows this, they continue to pay for the flesh of those animals. For pleasure. When vegans advocate for animals, people just laugh or say ""found the vegan.""

If having a conscience was common, extreme suffering would elicit way more concern. But that extreme suffering is legal and socially accepted. And people get some minor benefit from it (a few minutes of pleasure). In the absence of consequences, no one cares. For decades, entire lifetimes of eating tortured animals and not caring.

IMO, that's the clearest illustration in today's world that having a conscience is rare.  A lot of what looks like a conscience is just conformity and fear of consequences.

I've come to the conclusion that the reason they are so into this is because they are not smart and can only look at and assess the literal shapes and colors of things.

By ""shapes and colors"" generally I mean the concept of only being able to see a small portion of something or not assess nuance in any situation. Black and white simplistic thinking basically.

1706291840.0,unpopularopinion,"Suburbs are better than cities.Dont get me wrong, I like cities.

Having lived in dozens places across multiple countries, I have had the opportunity to experience a variety of living experiences.

Some of my best memories are from big cities. The combination of walkability, easy access to food/ entertainment and interesting and talented people is great. Suburbs, by comparison, tend to be pretty boring.

So why are suburbs better? It's simple. The problems in a big city massively outweigh the advantages of living there.

Housing is more expensive, smaller, and often lower quality in cities. Having looked for housing in both a city and its surrounding suburbs, the bar for what is considered a nice place in the city is often much lower than suburb. City landlords have no problem renting out crappy apartments lacking basic amenities, because someone will eventually rent it.

Even if you find good housing in a city, you have to share your space with many more people. City apartment living means sharing walls with a neighbor who might decide to start playing gangster rap at 3AM. Even houses are clustered closer together. In a suburb, you're unlikely to hear anything unless your neighbors are egregiously loud.

Cities mean more access to restaurants and entertainment, but do you really need 50 different Thai restaurants to choose from? Suburbs have access to 90% of what a city has, and for what it doesn't, you can just go to the city.

Cities tend to be higher in crime. They also tend to have less access to nature and higher pollution. Some rare examples like San Francisco have a lot of nature access, but are still weighed down by the other problems on this list.

Sure, needing to drive everywhere isn't ideal. Having the ability to walk places is nice. But aside from that, you can get the best of both worlds by living in a suburb and going to the city when you want or need to.

Simply put, cities are cool, but the tradeoffs aren't worth it. Suburbs provide peace and stability that cities do not with minimal tradeoffs. Hence, suburbs are better.",2074,356,1

Plagued by bureaucracy, infrequent and unhelpful support, and inappropriate job placements, the center highlights the need for a complete overhaul of the system to truly empower individuals with disabilities. Jane's story becomes a rallying cry for systemic reform. 

Once upon a time in a bustling city, there was a vocational rehabilitation (VR) center that promised new beginnings and thriving careers for those facing employment challenges due to disabilities. Jane Doe, a graphic designer impaired by a recent accident, approached the center with hopes high and spirits lifted. However, the shining beacon of VR turned out to be a flickering candle struggling against the winds of bureaucracy and underfunding.

Jane's initial assessment was promising, but the follow-ups were spaced months apart, each time with a different case worker who seemed more lost in paperwork than the last. The ""custom-tailored"" job placements were square pegs for Jane's round hole of qualifications and aspirations. Each suggested job was a step back from her skills, leaving her feeling undervalued and frustrated.

The final straw came when Jane was offered a position that required physical capabilities that her condition did not permit, a clear sign that her file was just another number, barely reviewed by overworked staff. Jane's story echoed in the halls of the VR center, among many who felt the sting of a system that was supposed to lift them up but instead let them fall through the cracks.

As Jane shared her story with the online world, it became a rallying cry for those who had lost faith in a system riddled with inefficiencies.

It is often thought as the most versatile mode of transport, and lead people to believe it is an indispensable thing in life and ignore the harm it brings. Chernobyl sparked worldwide protests at nuclear power, a single plane crash would be a devastating blow to the entire industry, but even as car crashes caused hundreds of times more deaths than nuclear accidents and plane crashes combined, people come to accept it has a natural thing in life. So there's a toxic arms race about getting the biggest and baddest car to protect themselves, not knowing the situation is made worse. Heck, there is even a popular genre of anime about reincarnation after being ran over by a truck. 

It also brings out the worst in people, since any mistake in a 2-ton expensive metal box travelling at significant speeds would cause a major financial loss and risk of life. My own father is usually a kind gentle and forgiving person, but the only time he spoke to another driver while on the car is a loud ""Fuck you!"" at their slightest mistakes.

Or, rather, meat substitute products will continue to remain novel while the average individual is content to consume real meat; while the average quality and palatability of veggie burgers and tofu and so on have certainly improved over the last two decades, all of these products continue to define themselves against what 'real meat' tastes and feels like. 

This does not have to be the case; these are processed food products, and 'appetizing' does not need to be synonymous with being 'a perfect mimicry of this food'; no person is buying SPAM for it's succulent porky essence, they are buying SPAM because it's a meat product that behaves reliably in specific modes of cooking and like the taste(s). A great deal of mileage could be gained by marketing these products as being genuine innovations in food production, rather than defining themselves against what already exists; these meats should not be limited by defining themselves against the models mother nature has provided our tastebuds, but instead should get weirder and creative for the sake of actually creating a product that can exist by it's own merits, both in terms of a flavor and texture profile but also as something people may consider to 'just be a product' they can enjoy and buy.",1925,325,1

But mask in their incredibly stupidity, is the legitimate issue of having privacy in public.  While there's a distinct difference between being a random background NPC, it's quite another to go the other extreme and claim all appearances on public grounds are fair use.

I bring to you the first example of harasser/prank youtubers.  If we agree that there is no limit to what you are allowed to do in public, then where is the outpouring of support for that youtuber that got shot in Virginia?  Because in that case, most people have the decency to know that maybe the delivery man just want to be left along and not participate in someone else's grand illusion.

Example number two, the exploding popularity of police station filming, where the videographer setup to intentionally antagonize the police.  Now, there are going to be more people in support of the filmer in this case because we think the police station should be public grounds and that, let's be honest, lots of people hate the police.

Let's go one step further.  What about Karen or  rage driver video?  I would argue that these people will have the least amount of support, and at the core, we post those video to seek judgment, to mock, or to inflame.  But that's the thing though, we, random strangers on the internet, are not judges.  We do not have legitimacy to film these events in hope of bringing someone down.  

So I say this current environment is a very dangerously delicate line that we are traversing.  It's easy to support the lack of public privacy when the targets are those we reject such as road ragers, Karen, or police.  But it's much harder when it applies to our perceived victims such as our prankees or even... yourself.  

At what point do I have the right to refuse to be judged by the vigilante action?  And that's really what it is.  We perceived justice to be inadequate, too slow, or unfair, so we take it upon ourselves by posting it on the internet.  

Now, I don't deny that there are evil doers in this world.  Surely, they are justified to be exposed and ridicule.  But at what point are we, random bystanders, qualified to judge fairly?  

Case in point, New York bike lady that lost her job because a few teenage hooligans that want to exploit a loophole in renting city bikes.  

So what if the Chinese group had presented their original request in a less asinine way?  Do we all have the right to not be a random protagonist or even... a background NPCs?

1706030331.0,unpopularopinion,"The Oscars are good and coolThe Academy uses ad revenue from the ceremony to preserve and restore old films, fund young filmmaker initiatives, and run their museum/theater which often shows old movies on film prints. Which all seems like a positive to me.

Also without them there would be very little incentive for studios or distributors to release movies for grownups, as an Oscar nomination can really help with box office for dramas. Because otherwise those types of movies don't make a whole lot of money except for extreme outliers like Oppenheimer.

And while most of the Oscar process is studios campaigning with special screenings with voters (who, for the record, are all directors, actors, writers, editors, set designers, composers, etc - not a board of old people conspiring to not nominate your favorite movie) I do think it is good that sometimes movies that aren't necessarily popular are nominated. Obviously a lot of the box office of today is dominated by CGI stuff, remakes, reboots, sequels, spinoffs, whatever instead of genuinely interesting art. And I think the Oscars are kind of a signal to people who are maybe not always on the pulse of cinema and they can learn about something off their radar. Parasite a few years ago being a great example. And hey maybe this year you should go check out Anatomy of a Fall - rentable for $6 if you're in the US. Good relationship/courtroom drama.

I myself watched the Oscars as a teenager and remember seeing Ennio Morricone win his honorary award, which was presented by Clint Eastwood. That was my first time hearing about The Good the Bad and the Ugly, which I caught on TV not long after and basically kickstarted my love of older movies. Sadly the honorary awards are no longer part of the ceremony, which I think is a missed opportunity to get younger people interested in cinema's history. Who doesn't want to see Sam Jackson or Hayao Miyazaki or Mel Brooks or Angela Bassett get honored for their careers? Would be entertaining imo.

So does Hollywood like to pat itself on the back? Yes. Is that REALLY a bad thing though? I don't know... Hollywood is one of America's biggest exports and seeing people generally underrepresented win major awards, whether its Asian-Americans or the deaf community in the last two years, makes it more acceptable for them to get future movies/shows off the ground that may have not been greenlit otherwise. Seems like another good and cool thing.

The guy is a egotist who only gives his son any positive attention when he successfully tries to emulate him. Otherwise he doesn't help or notice him in any way whatsoever. Time and again he shows in the movie that he's more concerned with his family's reputation than his son's actual well being. 

Worst of all in a pivotal moment in the movie when Little was practically begging his father for emotional support in his hour of need, he just bluntly told his own son in front of the whole town that he doesn't believe him. I mean it would be understandable if he didn't believe him, he just didn't have to do him like that.

1705928245.0,unpopularopinion,"Challenging the Notion: Educational Achievement and True Intelligence Aren't SynonymousHigh educational achievement for a piece of paper requires the part of your brain that has to be good at remembering information. Other than that, you can be very stupid overall.  
  
People need to stop associating the ability to remember lots of information (crystallized intelligence) with the ability to work out complex and logical problems on demand (fluid intelligence). Just because someone is able to remember lots of information to get a piece of paper does not mean that they will be able to make difficult and accurate decisions, especially not under pressure.  
  
For example, I'm a 2000 Elo-rated chess player, but I hate the part of the game where you have to memorize opening theory - so I don't. I find it very boring, and I play for the thrill of solving new challenges on demand. I was once in a chess Discord room with around 7 people, and one of them said that they wanted to play a 'strong player'. This is, of course, very subjective, but I thought since I'm in the top 1% of rated players, I'll offer to play them. Before playing me, they started asking me a number of different questions about different opening variations, which I didn't know because I didn't care for memorization. Yes, it's a part of the game, yes, it takes skill, but it's an isolated skill. Since I didn't know these opening theory questions, they were unsure about playing me, asked for my Elo, and didn't believe me when I told them 2000. I assured them I was telling the truth, played them in a game, and completely and utterly wiped the floor with them. Turns out they were a 1500-1600 player that had memorized more opening theory than me; however, I was able to think more critically on demand.  
  
Ultimately, someone who has a good memory does indeed possess a certain type of intelligence and skill, which can be used to obtain high academic achievements, among other things, but it does not guarantee that they are an intelligent person overall.  
  
Yes, I'm aware that some academic courses will require more than just memorization; however, it is mostly just memorization, even in courses such as computer science, which requires programming. You'll find that a lot of students come out of university unable to work in a competitive industry because they can't simply use memorized information to make money for an ever-changing and competitive business.",2461,414,1

Fast pass users wait less (and generally have less restrictions) while regular lines move more consistently.

With less people skipping the line since it’s more expensive, the standard lines move faster as more people from the standard line are able to ride. And if you do pay for a pass, you wait less in the fast pass line. The park may even be able to offer greater access to fast pass users since there are fewer of them.

I frequently go to parks from both Disney and Universal, both with and without the skip the line option, and have noticed a stark contrast between Disney’s and Universal’s line management. 

Genie+ at Disney is much more affordable ($20 to $35 per person per day), and thus, a lot of people actually buy it. Genie+ lines often get backed up and take 20-30 minutes at the popular rides, even though you have to make a reservation on the app for each ride you use Genie+ on. Meanwhile, the standby lines move at a crawl and frequently stop completely for 5-10 minutes just so they can let more Genie+ users through.

Express at Universal is more expensive ($80 to $300 per person per day) and it’s not something that most guests buy. You almost never see Express waits over 15 minutes, and that’s with them allowing Express users to just walk into the rides (no reservations needed). The standby lines also move at a much more steady and consistent pace, and almost never have to slow down since the Express lane is backed up.

Making fast passes more expensive can allow parks to still bring in extra revenue while providing a greater value for those that buy into the system and a better experience for everyone.

Edited to add: **Ideally, I’d prefer that paid “skip the line” services not exist at all,** and instead have either a free virtual queue system (like the old Disney FastPass) and/or just regular lines (as well as disability access services for those that need it). It’s just that since parks found this as a profit opportunity, and they likely won’t stop selling these, the next best thing is to make it expensive, rather than the affordable version like Disney’s Genie+.",2290,402,1

When I say crushed biscuit I mean digestives (Graham Crackers in the USA) - there is an added bonus of flexibility that isn't possible with garbage short crust pastry and the likes: You can add ginger snaps or hobnobs to include ginger and oats into the fray. Some folk even go mental and crush oreos, although personally I feel that sort of hubris has folk flying a little too close to the sun.

Millionaires Shortbread - ditch the dense bland crappy base and use crushed biscuit base (we call this Caramel cake in Scotland) and it is a thousand fold better.

Cheesecake - I have never seen a short crust pastry base for cheesecake because it just wouldn't be good.

So now you might be thinking - but what about enclosed pies? The humble apple pie maybe? Well apple crumble is the crushed biscuit equivalent of a topping and is significantly tastier, versatile and has a far more satisfying texture. 

Another thing that absolutely sucks baws with pastry is the garbage scenario of trying to serve: The risk of the base not releasing from the tin or of the base being soggy, or cracking during cooking or of the sides collapsing once removed from the pie tin meaning the slice of pie is little more than a mess of broken pastry and dreams.

For simple traffic tickets, you are afforded the oportunity to show up to court on your own. It should be so for all crimes unless the person has a history of crime or of skipping court days or if the police believe the person could cause harm unless detained.

If a person is detained, house arresr should the the first option. If jailed, the accused should be afforded all luxuries and a private accomodation. If the government can't afford that, then they cannot afford justice. The accused should have comfortable accomodations, order/bring their own food, bring their electronics, pets, work remotely,etc...

If the jail experience amounts to punishment then the government has already tried the accused informally and punished them. Any formal trial or punishment after that amounts to double jeopardy.

I was jailed a while back for a few days, it was so horrible the idea of pleading not guilty and staying there unthinkable so I plead guilty (driving without a license) under duress. My punishment was ""time served"". The government openly acknowledges that people in jail are serving time prior to any trial or conviction. If I fought the charge and was found innocent, I would not be compensated for ""time served""

But last year, on my vacation, I flew a total of three legs, one on Ryanair itself, and the other two on its subsidiaries (Malta Air and Lauda), and it was perfectly fine.

The surcharge for checked luggage wasn't that much (and anyway, on European flights, you can't avoid it even with the flag carriers these days), we weren't in any way pushed to buy lottery tickets, perfume or expensive snacks (EasyJet was much worse), all the flights were perfectly on time (unlike my experience with the flag carriers), no-one was running around with a measuring tape at the gate to double-check our under seat backpacks, the seats were OK enough, the online check-in was butter smooth (again, unlike my experience with flag carriers).

My only gripe was the bording process: Getting crammed in an airside bus and then enduring the heat and noise of the apron while slowly inching my way up the stairs is certainly much less comfortable than using a jet bridge.

The issue for me wasn’t with Cillian Murphy, rather it was with everyone else. When so many well known faces are used in one film, I find it sort of breaks the illusion of the people they are portraying. 

Cillian was so well cast. He looked the part and his performance was phenomenal. And even though all the other performances were fantastic, as soon as I saw Robert Downey Jr. there was a break in the reality for me. I couldn’t not see the actor. Throughout the film this kept happening, with Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Casey Affleck (whose voice was easily identifiable before we even saw him), Rami Malek etc. Even lesser characters were well known faces from recent hit tv series… 

Of course this type of situation isn’t new. Directors like to work with the same actors over and over for convenience, somebody knows somebody, people are friends etc. I just wonder how much more authentic movies like Oppenheimer would’ve felt with equally talented but less recognizable actors filling the majority of the roles.

I've read quotes from Trent Reznor and Maynard James Keenan among others, dismissing Limp Bizkit as garbage music. I love Tool and NIN, and have great respect for both, but it seems to me that these assessments are from an emotional place and don't really evaluate the music.

I would agree that a lot of the persona and subject matter coming from Fred Durst is somewhat juvenile.

Secondly, the word these people who throw around ""judge"" seem to really mean is ""condemn,"" but I doubt too many people who use ""judge"" all the time even know what that means. (Yes, that's a little rude, but I think it's true.) Judgments can be positive, neutral, or negative. Condemnations are definitive and negative, and most people who talk about people judging other people act like you as an individual aren't allowed to draw some kind of conclusion based on the information you get from that person. Of course you can, but you can also have the cognizance to know that that INITIAL judgment is likely to change and might be inaccurate. THAT'S OKAY. It's outright condemning someone about whom you have very flimsy very little information about that is an actual problem that yes, plenty of people have.

Again, everyone is supposed to draw conclusions. It's how you make decisions, it's how you learn, and it's how you survive. However, those conclusions should be based on logic instead of ego, and people should be self-aware of their own biases and be mature enough to know when and when not to act on them.

So many people complain about ""being judged"" that it just sounds like whining at this point, because it's overused, just like any other played out buzzword, and to the point that it has little to no weight. It's so overused that these days it sounds like the one's complaining are the one's being judgmental of people who just disagree with them as well as the people who are actually condemning them, and it's that flagrant use of the word that makes them sound childish. Yes, unjust condemnation is wrong, but do people even know the difference nowadays? SO WHAT if someone has made an incorrect *judgment* about you (especially on the internet)? They can have an opinion, and if they're wrong, then they'll either learn more or be dumb enough to show off their ignorance for the world to see.

Everyone is allowed to have an opinion, people, even if they're wrong. If they are unjustly ""condemning"" you, then that's on them for being ignorant and pig-headed.

Millennials and new home owners - it’s your fault…It’s not a surprise nobody can afford housing anymore, because everyone, and I mean everyone, uses housing as an investment. 

It’s funny to see my grandparents, parents, aunts, uncles and extended family, who had average jobs (teacher, machinist, salon or even corporate roles) think that their duplex house on a half acre is worth 500k-1M or more. Yet they are acutely aware they would never be able to afford a house like that on their current or former salary. They hope to sell their property to either downsize and purchase that new corvette (aunt did) or just rent out their property at stupid rates so the renter pays their nursing home bills (great uncle).

How did this happen? It’s us. We are agreeing to pay these dumb prices. Maybe our generation got used to taking out impossible loans to pay back (school loans are so delectable), maybe too many got excited about quick home appreciations during the 08 bubble and think that home prices go zirp forever, or maybe this is the first time we’re seeing generational wealth being accumulated and passed down from boomers in mass causing the spike. Yet almost everyone from the older generation has the audacity to sell their home for more money than they probably generated in their entire life - knowing very well they could never afford that in the last or now.

Regardless, whats keeping the prices high is us. If millennials and new homeowners collectively withheld their desire to take out that meaty mortgage, prices would drop. I for sure don’t think my aunts shitty home is worth the amount she sold it for and it would make me even more mad that she would buy another smaller home with the cash and a new corvette with the money she got from her previous house, all the while the new homebuyer is living house poor in my aunts old home. And they are making more than my aunt did when she bought the house.

So we have to toughen up and find more creative ways to find shelter and save for retirement. Stop buying homes and renting at stupid prices. Do it long enough, prices will go down. This may mean staying with parents, find super cheap shitty rental, or even sleeping in car. Or buy a house and join the mob by renting out rooms for stupid prices to pay your mortgage. I know it’s not ideal - but my aunt and uncle don’t care - they just want you to pay for their shit. And they raise their rents every year with no complaints because us idiots keep paying.

The problem is once prices do go down, tragedy of the commons kicks in and we’ll probably end up in the same mess.

Possible spoilers for the movie below

As title says, yes it has some good scenes but the new girl situation would have hurt me if I watched it right after a break up.


Good a few months have passed type movie (I watched it 6-7 months after a break up). But not good for those who just went through it, especially for the first time. It would hurt to see the protagonist go through what he has been through without you personally even starting. And then he finds a perfect girl coincidentally?!?  Nah I’d be so upset if I watched it a week after my last breakup vs months later when I was in a better headspace


To each their own but this is my two cents. Also I can see how it can be ok for breakups after very short term relationships or if it isn’t your first relationship/breakup, but not for a first or bad one imo. Especially if cheating was involved. I don’t like to compare (as it is the thief of joy) but during depressing times my mind just does it for insecurities and etc.

Edit: I made this post because of posts that go like “I just went through a breakup, what are some good movies to watch to help ease the pain.” They always have this movie high up, and I disagree after finally watching it last year

1705612698.0,unpopularopinion,"Locking all items up, Is a good idea.

Recently, at one of the stores i frequent, we witnessed a middle aged woman attempt to steal some things and walk out with her cart (and she was with a few people who of course, just left her) when she thought she was just going to be able to run out the door, she was met with employees and the lost prevention security from behind and in front of her. When she tried to get past them, they took her to the ground, her shoes flew off and hit the door. But not all stores, do this.
 
So I hear it all the time lately, about how frustrated people are about either being watched by employees when looking at locked up items and just having to wait on an employee to open it so you can purchase it, so now people are choosing to shop online more often, which is great since you'll have no option but to pay.

I mean, it seems to be a good chunk of society thinks it's no problem to steal anything and everything and use the excuse of ""Well, they're a big business, they have insurance, it's not going to hurt the business, they make a lot of money anyway."" Yea, well THAT'S the exact attitude that has got us here in the first place.

People can deny it all they want, but there's plenty of videos that have captured these kinds of people, in groups, obliterating stores. Or the cases of maybe 2 or 3 people walking out with full carts of stuff and running to the car to drive away without paying so in my opinion, it's well deserved. You want to inconvenience places with your  ""I don't have to, I'm entitled, i deserve this stuff"" Attitude, then you should have prepared to be treated that way, and you have ruined it for the rest of us who actually pay for our things. 

I'm surprised they haven't used this idea for clothing sections. I get some stores have ""tags"" or something similar to prevent theft of clothing, but a lot of times that doesn't work. Maybe they should renovate clothing sections as well so all that is on a rotating swivel, also locked up. (Like they do with jewelry) and in order for you to try it on, they have to come unlock it as well. And then implement a rule at the changing rooms, to have the employees actually check you before leaving that section, to be sure you're not hiding stolen property. 
(I understand this is a far reach. But IMO, the ""no chase, no confront"" rule should be changed. The Irate, angry, confrontational when they are caught people should be banned. And by doing so, less people will act that way knowing they won't get away with a temper tantrum. And by destroying property in an angry fit, is usually a jail sentence).

I understand, that for those who aren't thieves are irked by it. It sucks that it's unfair, but it's those who do steal, that have ruined it for the rest of us like i said. It's not the businesses fault for taking these extra steps so that they actually stay in business.",2885,544,1

The story always goes that the local government was out to get him, that they conspired against him to make his life miserable, and he was just a “reasonable man forced to do unreasonable things.” The problem is, this story is almost entirely made up. It only takes a little research to see that most of Heemeyer’s claims were dubious or coincidental at best, and outright lies at worst. For example, one of his biggest complaints was that the city wanted him to pay to install sewage on a property he bought. He knew at the time of purchasing that the property did not have a proper sewage system, and paying to install your own sewage is standard practice in America. As for the concrete plant that blocked access to his muffler shop, it didn’t. It has been proven time and time again that Heemeyer was making shit up to get the concrete plant stopped. The people constructing it did everything perfectly legally, and even attempted to make concessions to put him at ease, which he refused. 

However, I think the biggest thing that everyone overlooks about Marvin Heemeyer was that he was batshit insane. If you watch the documentary or listen to his tapes, you will see that Heemeyer believed he was in direct communication with God. He believed God was commanding him build his “killdozer” and that by destroying the town he would be executing Gods plan. 

Marvin Heemeyer is put on this pedestal as an anti establishment martyr who gave his life fighting the evil bureaucrats.

My hoover wind tunnel will literally out suck (no pun intended) your Dyson with their puny ""digital motor"" 

Edit #2 OK, so maybe a bagless is fine in a home setting where you don't have massive quantities of dirt. I've been forced to use one in a commercial setting and had to switch to a commercial vac which BTW most if not all commercial vacs are bagged because the bagless ones clog up too fast to be useful in a commercial setting. 


Final Edit: if some of you still don't believe me, check out this video on why Shark vacuums are some of the worst designed vacuums ever. you laugh at us nerds but we prove you wrong with science.

Online harassment usually isn't as simple as ""log off"" or ""just block them"" - there are many examples of harassment over the internet that while you might be aware of- most people don't consider when this topic comes up. A lot of these are hard for especially women.   


Posting about a person or sending private information about a person online is a problem itself but what a lot of people fail to remember is that this follows you into your personal life especially in a school environment. Yeah you can log off or ignore messages but now it's just happening behind your back until it follows you into your real life.   


Posting nudes, private messages, speaking about somebodies trauma- the internet in general has made people less empathetic and respectful because behind a screen there are less consequences for the person doing the harassment.   


For many women, when a guy messages them in creepy ways or sends unsolicited photos it is very easy for them to create alternate accounts to continue pursuing them, message their family or friends or even just escalate the situation toward in person harassment since they no longer are able to message them.   


Yet all school systems seem to teach this basic understanding of very miniscule situations such as someone insulting you in a groupchat, giving the advice to just block them and take it to a counselor but counselor's themselves usually will do nothing about it.

1705427446.0,unpopularopinion,"Streaming feels like such a hollow experience compared to when cable reigned supreme, and the solution is adding curated programing blocks complete with bumpers and promos.I've been watching through some older anime lately that I was too young to experience airing on Toonami, but something has felt off about it. All of the pomp and circumstance that made the next episode an event are all gone. After only a few episodes, no matter how good the series, I'm struck by a sense of monotony. Even shows made specifically for streaming that end each episode on a tantalizing cliffhanger become a chore to watch within a handful of episodes. These are shows designed to be binged, yet they lack the ability to retain my excitement. 

I may just be growing weary of this cycle as I age, but I believe there's a deeper problem at play. While some shows release on a weekly basis as a way to replicate the eventfulness of the cable experience, but most viewers aren't able to keep up. Also, any series that is already in its stride/completed cant use this tactic. 

If streaming services want to keep the attention of their audience, they need to take another page out of cable's playbook. Bumpers and promos already exist for many of the programs that they have the license to, so working out a deal to license those could be a sensible tactic for retaining viewership over longer periods. Programing blocks could be as simple as allowing users to create their own, or again use the content that already exists as a sort of ""portal"" to the time they were released. They could even go as far as curating their own blocks with service specific bumpers and promos to stick in the existing ad breaks, whether the service has ads or not. Running old ads would be a stretch, but it'd be cool to get the whole time machine experience.

1705282302.0,unpopularopinion,"90s Music (Grunge and ""Alternative"") is Not that ""Deep"" or ""Unique""I think there's a strange conceit among people - especially people who were teens or young adults in the 1990s - that grunge was somehow more meaningful than popular music. I am not hating on this style of music at all, I just do not agree that it's all so much more mature or intelligent than popular music of the time. I will explain why.

MANY songs of the early 1990s - ranging from Nirvana hits like Sliver or Smells Like Teen Spirit to Belly's Slow Dog or The Breeders Cannonball - have utter nonsense for lyrics. While I agree that some Nirvana songs are more meaningful, it's completely false to claim that ""smarter"" people listen to lyrics like ""grandma take me home."" 

Teenagers LIKE nonsense lyrics. In many ways, teenagers are still children, and they love catchy songs with silly words. That's why a lot of the Doo Wop and Bubblegum Pop of the 1950s and 60s was such a big hit with teens (who put the bomp in the bomp da bomp? Who put the ram in the rama lama ding dong?) and it's also why tacky girl and boy bands persisted throughout the 1970s and/or 80s.

Even when the lyrics are ""deeper"" most kids don't understand or give a thought to what they mean. For example Belly's Slow Dog was inspired by a Chinese myth about an adulterous woman forced to carry a dead dog on her back, and Tonya Donnelly made the story American Southern Gothic instead of Chinese so she wasn't straight up stealing a myth. HOWEVER, MOST PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW THAT. The average person who listened to Belly in 1993 have no idea what ""Marie carry a rifle/Marie carry a dog on your back/That dog is here again/That Slow Dog is here again/With his see through skin/The kinda skin you can see through/He shot again"" means. It's really a nonsense Dada-esque stream of consciousness images. And ""The kinda skin you can see through"" is a dumb lyric. I'm not saying it's a bad song, I just don't think people who like alternative or grunge are necessarily smarter or deeper than the average pop fan.

We can also consider stuff like the virtualized 7.1 sound. It sounds fancy and all, but there are no headphones that would do this right and the sound using this technology sounds worse than just some good, wired stereo headphones

Another example might be an electric shaver. The systems are getting more and more complex, cost fortunes, but still no electric shaver is able to shave you as smoothly and close to the skin as the analog shavers that require cream, etc. 

My point is that... What's the point? The new, fancy appliances or devices are so costly, yet they can't compete with the analog predecessors. The only thing they are better at is that they might not have a cable anymore",1152,204,1

I’m there for a couple of hours enjoying the show, why can’t I spend a few minutes recording and taking photos? Also, who says I’m not ”being in the moment” just because I have my phone up? Usually I just press record and hold it at the right angle without looking at it. Let people record a few videos when they are attending a show that they might only see once in their life.

1705291976.0,unpopularopinion,"It's normal to have savings or financial gains that you don't say your partner about.All those betrayals I saw and experienced were very similar in one thing - the person leaving did it abruptly and without warning. They did prepare ""second base"" before giving even a hint that relationships will end or before discussing anything slippery. I get it - it's much more comfortable and secure. Why extend period of questions and awkwardness...just dump them. 

This strategy results in other person being caught off guard and left with various troubles -like rent, pets, new credit schedule etc. Simple - suddenly one person disappears from the team. In the moment when you absolutely don't expect this to happen - because for them this is the most safe and convenient moment. If you are upper class you may have different modes of calculation. But the issue can be translated into different circumstances in general.

People who lie to you or plan to use you they...surprise often don't look like that. So when you have some money saved out of family budget you can be sure you'll be safe whatever happens at least for month or two.

1705273995.0,unpopularopinion,"By this point, no one should want to be a teacher.Hear me out.

1. We expect teachers to deal with a classroom of around 30 kids for 8 hours a day. 30 kids, when parents struggle to deal with 1-4 children.
2. The pay is a joke. Seriously the pay in comparable to factory or warehouse work.
3. By this point, teachers get limited assistance from principles and frequently get thrown under the bus by parents. We are to the point that Teachers can be THREATENED by students, and the kid is in school the next day like nothing happened. Teachers can't *actually* discipline children because parents rarely work with them. So what does a teacher do if a student entirely ignores the teacher? So what, the teacher took away recess or gave a detention, but the student JUST IGNORES the punishment. What happens next? If the parents aren't working with teachers to ensure discipline, it just leads to nothing.
4. This is the most absurd in my head. A teacher is expected to be willing to lay down their life for their student. We expect a teacher to be willing to shield their students with their body if the unthinkable happen. But Why would they? The pay is a joke, the kids don't listen, the principle doesn't help. Why would a person who is constantly at odds with the students suddenly decide to protect those students with their life?

So ya, By this point no one should want to be a teacher. Every teacher seems to be saying the profession is awful now, no one is advocating for it, so ya, no one should *want* to be a teacher anymore.

1705269449.0,unpopularopinion,"While the transfer portal and NIL rules are good things for college athletes under the NCAA, they are the final nails in the coffin of the concept of “student athletes”A couple caveats to lead off with.

Under a system where the NCAA earns mountains of money using college athletes as their product, and many students and families are struggling to make ends meet while they are in college, I think it’s great that college athletes are getting their due.

Also, this really only applies to football and basketball at this point, we’ll have to see how these developments affect other college sports.

I also realize the commercialization of college sports has many related benefits, like being able to view games anywhere in the country, and bringing money into schools (how they spend it is another matter).

While I recognize the caveats above, I’m not happy with the direction college sports are taking. College athletes majoring in “basket weaving” was already a common joke, but the curtain has been entirely pulled away by these recent developments. I have a hard time believing any athletes switching schools two or three times are getting any sort of consistent or meaningful education.

There used to be a certain romance surrounding college sports, with athletes actually being part of their student bodies, and in a way representing them. It was a point of pride for colleges to have good athletic programs as a way to show the strength and diversity of their student body, not a line item on the annual budget sheet. 

College athletics has been completely divorced from the academic mission, where we no longer have a college league, but effectively a junior-pro organization.

Please understand I like cake and I like chocolate... I just think chocolate cake is one of the worst cakes ever.

It's one thing to eat a chocolate bar in the comfort of your closet after everyone else has gone to bed, it's quick, it's easy, and it's handy.

Chocolate cake, on the other hand, is just too dense and overpoweringly sweet.  You get a mouthful of chocolate cake and it's just an instant feeling that your mouth is full of mud.  It turns your teeth brown and gets in every little crevice.  The icing is ***invariably*** waaaaaay too chocolatey.  And on the topic of icing, it seems impossible for anyone to make chocolate icing that isn't simply overpoweringly thick, like a gritty sweetened peanut butter, but worse.  Give me some buttercreme.  Give me some vanilla.  Heck, I'll even take some red velvet (hurp) over chocolate icing any day.  Plus why do people feel the need to make their chocolate cakes ten damn stories tall with layer after layer after layer?  Take a look at an average vanilla cake and you get, what, three layers max?  But I'll be damned if I can escape the Cheesecake Factory without seeing the waiter walk by with some 8 layer monstrosity.  So you ask your kid what cake they want on their birthday and they say chocolate?  Don't punish them with one of those.  You catch them smoking and you make them smoke a whole pack?  That's fine, but don't abuse your child by making them eat that cake.

Oh, and chocolate cheesecake?  Forget it!  You might as well smear sweetened drywall caulk all over the inside of your mouth to the point that you have trouble breathing.

Toppings are the worst, too, because seriously what toppings does anyone put on chocolate cakes/cheesecakes?  More damn chocolate.  Crumbled oreos.  Chocolate syrup.  Straight up damn cocoa powder.  I'm like, we get it - it's damn chocolate.  Settle down, lady!  With vanilla cakes/frostings (one of the best flavors in all the world, imo) you can add whatever you like.  Want some strawberries?

1705225243.0,unpopularopinion,"Focusing on strength is a trap for most liftersThere are certain instances where building strength is important. If you want to compete in a strength sport for example, or if you're using lifting to build strength for a sport, or if you just enjoy it, then that's fine

However, if your goals are just to look good and build muscle. focusing on strength is a trap. I'm specifically talking here about powerlifting strength (Barbell back squat, barbell bench press, barbell deadlift) and standing overhead press. Those are typically the the lifts people focus on when they talk about strength

When people first start out lifting, they are typically told to focus on the basics (IE the powerlifts and overhead press) and are told to ignore isolation exercises. They are typically given a terrible program such as starting strength or stronglifts 5x5. These programs lead to

1. Unbalanced physiques (No focus on side/rear delts, little focus on lats/upper back, little focus on biceps/triceps, no focus on calves, no focus on abs, no focus on forearms, little focus on quads, heavy focus on posterior chain and chest). Also known as the ""spider"" physique (Large torso muscles, small limb muscles)
2. A focus on chasing numbers rather than focusing on building the muscle

A focus on powerlifting strength tends to lead people to worry about the weight on the bar more than they worry about building the actual muscle. This could mean improving leverages to lift more weight (massive bench press arch, sumo deadlift, low bar back squat), not focusing on a good lifting tempo (Dropping the bar to your chest on a bench press, pausing, and heaving the weight back up, dive bombing a squat), or taking longer and longer rest periods in order to lift the heaviest weight possible. That last point may not seem like a bad thing but you could get to a point where you are taking so long to rest between sets (5-10 minutes) that you can't even do your entire workout or your workout could take 2-3 hours long and it's really hard to give those last exercises the energy they deserve if you've already been in the gym for 2 hours

Now, that isn't to say that you shouldn't be focused on progressive overload. As you lift weights over months and years, you will be putting more weight on the bar/dumbbell/machine. But that will be the result of you gaining more muscle and it will be the muscle gain driving the need to increase the weight, not the other way around. 

If you are doing a chest-supported row to build your lats and you do 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps, you will eventually need to add weight over time to maintain that rep range. But your goal shouldn't be to keep adding weight, your goal should be to reach close to failure in that 8-12 rep range and use whatever weight gives you that outcome

Another reason to avoid the strength cope is because it tends to make the lifter bias only barbell or compound lifts, and to avoid isolation lifts. Or to view isolation lifts merely as ""accessory lifts"". Do you want big biceps? You should do bicep curls. You should treat your bicep curls the same as your squats, and you should put just as much focus into them. They shouldn't be an afterthought. I have heard strength copers say the dumbest things such as ""You want big biceps? You should squat 500 pounds"". It's complete nonsense. 

There's also a concept in bodybuilding called the stimulus/fatigue ratio. As you become a more advanced lifter and build more and more muscle, you actually want to focus on exercises that use LESS weight. For example, you may get to the point where you can lift 405 for 10 reps in the romanian deadlift. The systemic fatigue on your entire body the RDL causes can become massive when compared to the stimulus on your hamstrings/glutes. You may want to focus less on the RDL and more on exercises such as machine leg curls or weighted back extensions, where you can stress the hamstrings just as much but with less overall fatigue

A LOT of lifters get caught in this strength cope cycle. It happened to me and many others I know. But I think it's important to think about why you are really lifting weights. Is it because you want to tell people that you can bench 405 and squat 675? Or is it because you want to look lean and jacked and cool and sick and feel good?

I'm going to rapid fire out a few other copes/traps to avoid

1. Not doing cardio (Cardio is great for you)
2. Not doing machines (Machines can be great for building muscle, and can have a great stimulus/fatigue ratio, especially for stronger, more advanced lifters)
3. Not eating enough protein (Protein has the highest TEF of all macros and is the most filling)
4. Avoiding stretching (Too much static stretching before lifting COULD be bad but there's nothing wrong with light stretching if it helps you perform the lift in the necessary range of motion)
5. Focusing too much on science based lifting (Many studies have very small sample sizes. Also, anecdotal evidence from actually jacked lifters should not be brushed off)
6. Thinking you need to use steroids because you think you reached your ""natural limit"" (You probably have not, you probably just need to keep lifting)
7. Thinking you HAVE to do a certain lift. That even includes everything I'm talking about in this post. If you enjoy strength, you should do it. If you enjoy focusing on upper body over lower body, you should do it. If you enjoy focusing on lower body over upper body, it's kind of weird as a guy and it's going to lead to a weird physique, but if that's what you like then who cares you should do it
8. This kind of goes along with point #7 above but you have to find what works for you. Some people just aren't built well for the squat, and that's ok. They may do better with a smith machine squat with heels elevated, or even a leg press. If a lift works for you and you're making gains from it, you should do it. If a lift feels like crap and you don't want to do it, you don't have to. You're lifting for yourself to transform your physique the way you see fit. You don't have to impress people on the internet with your squat if you don't want to

This is highly unpopular, but I've been around the VTuber community since 2019. I was there before the big boom in 2020, and I noticed many changes within the Western audience. 

I think vtubers are the new egirls of the internet, and their fans are the new simps. You're probably asking why and let me tell you, I've noticed that many Western vtubers focus a lot on fan service. Just look at any random model, and you see very revealing models with unrealistic physics. Many popular clips on YouTube are about their chat ""innocently"" teasing the streamer's body, and they react by saying something like, ""Look I have big boing boings!"" Followed by them aggressively moving up and down. And for the past year, I noticed that any vtubers act dumb in order to fall for a lewd joke and  ""accidentally"" do something sexual to gain a couple of super chats. 

For vtubers such as gawr gura, I noticed that any slight criticism towards her is meant by her die hard fans name-calling them people and telling them to ""touch grass."" For those who do not know, gawr gura is the most subscribed and well-known corporate vtuber. Lately, she's been gone for months and radio silence only to come back and stream on anniversaries and special events such as Valentine streams, where she racks in thousands in super chats PER stream.

I can go on and write an entire paper about the community and streaming culture; however, it is late at night, and I have work tomorrow. These are just late-night thoughts. I hope to start a civil conversation in the comments and gn.

Conversely, if a girl says they won’t date short guys because either they themselves are tall and it creates logistical issues, or because they like feeling tiny, then that’s fine…but if they won’t do it due to the social stigma of short guys being inferior to tall guys or not wanting to have short kids, then that’s a red flag.",772,136,1

1595636765.0,college,"An Honest Letter from Your University President About Why We're Opening This FallDear faculty,

Oh, and staff. Sorry, we keep forgetting you exist. So sorry. You're like the middle child of higher education. You've been so quiet since you realized that unlike faculty we'll actually fire you for speaking up.

Many of you have expressed concern with our plans to move ahead with in-person classes this fall. I personally find the plan to be relatively simple.

All we need to do to safely and successfully reopen is require everyone to wear a mask at all times, test all students, faculty and staff for COVID-  before fall semester starts, require all students to self-isolate for   days before they arrive, split most of our classes into two groups that will never meet together in-person, remove half the furniture from all of our classrooms and public spaces, dedicate entire ~~dorms~~ residence halls to housing sick students, train faculty to live stream their classes to remote students while juggling the virtual and in-person management of questions and feedback, assume students will maintain physical distance and wear masks when they're off campus, assume students won't go to any parties, prep faculty to move to remote instruction immediately if they get sick or have to self-quarantine, require faculty to designate a ""colleague on call"" to serve as their academic next of kin who'll teach their class for no additional pay if they get sick or die, rearrange foot traffic patterns in all of our buildings and stairwells, dramatically increase cleaning responsibilities for our overstretched environmental services team, completely change how we distribute food in dining halls, set the HVAC to blow as hard as possible in every building to keep air flow moving, hope our toxic work culture doesn't lead to people coming in sick despite us not updating our sick or leave policies to accommodate for a generational pandemic, and cross our fingers that we get to the point in the semester where we don't have to give refunds for housing or dining plans when we move to all online instruction anyway.

I don't see what's so complicated.

But since you all keep *insisting* on asking why we're taking such a ""risk"" in the midst of an unprecedented global pandemic in a country with a negligent federal response and a bunch of morons who think this is all a hoax and that mask wearing is how Bill "" G"" Gates will steal their rights or whatever, I'm writing to clarify the university's motivations for fall.

**Money.**

Oh my god *we're so boned* if we don't get more money.

Do you not realize how much of our funding is based on dramatically overpriced housing and food? Do you not know what an auxiliary service is? *Have you not noticed a bottle of Diet Coke is $ .  in the cafeteria?* Do you not come to the budget meetings we schedule once a year at  : pm the Friday before a holiday weekend?

Our endowment is like your savings account: Woefully inadequate and incapable of saving you. If we lose that sweet, sweet housing and food money we are going to have to fire at least a third of you to keep our own jobs safe, but at least we'll have a good reason to ditch those of you with tenure we don't like because you criticized us once three years ago. I'm coming for you, *Christina*.

So buck up, cupcake. Be resilient. Double your workload so you can help us maintain the façade that opening for in-person instruction is somehow going to be safe until we hit the tuition and housing due date.

We *need you* to do all this extra work so we can get that sweet, sweet student money and stay afloat. *You* are how we are going to get through this. ~~We're going to squeeze you dry and then ask for more (NOTE: Let's remove this line before we hit send).~~ By the way, here's a website about self-care that has three broken links to in-person yoga classes from last year.

This *will* involve you spending the summer designing your course twice for both in-person and online instruction. Extra funding? Hahahahahaha Nah, but here's a webcam and the login page for Zoom. Make it work.

To answer another question you've been pestering us with: Yes, we *have* noticed all the local K  school districts are going to be starting the school year online. As such, I've directed HR to do absolutely nothing to accommodate those of you who have been audacious enough to procreate. Figure it out. We can always replace you with a grad student or post doc who's desperate enough to barely scrape by. Your call.

What? No, no we definitely won't be paying you more for the extra work you're doing.

Yes, this is probably your new normal workload moving forward if you're lucky enough to survive the Hunger Games machinations our CFO will be doing this fall.

No, we won't guarantee you won't be furloughed or fired anyway in two months.

Yes, this will put the Black and Latinx members of our community at risk since they're disproportionately represented on our environmental services staff. Unrelated note: Did I mention we're changing the name of that building that's been named after a white supremacist the past   years? I, for one, am grateful to be a part of solving racism forever.

Where was I again? Oh yes, money.

We need money to under pay you, the staff, and the adjuncts who teach  % of our courses. So take this mask we paid too much to put our logo on and get to work. At least until the tuition refund deadline passes.

Love,

Your University President

>**I had a ton of people telling me to make him a sandwich back, so I decided to do it! When our lecture ended today, I walked up to him and told him that I made him a sandwich. When I handed it to him, he had a huge smile on his face and said, ""Wow thanks! I appreciate that"". We then ended up chatting for a bit and exchanged instas.**

So here's the final update - A lot of redditors were telling me to message him on insta first and to ask him to study for finals with me. So I listened to everyone and messaged him last week! He agreed to it and we ended up studying together and getting to know each other. We took our final exam last thursday, and after that he asked if I wanted to have dinner with him to celebrate the last day of school. I told him that I couldn't because I had car racing practice that night. So he then asked me if he can watch me practice, and I said yeah.

So that night, he watched me drive lap after lap. Then after my practice when my coach left, sandwich guy asked me if he can try out my car.

We had a   multiple choice question quiz once a week in place of tests that were based on short readings from various webpages that he would give us. I was sitting at a high B and really wanted an A in the class. 

The week before the final he told us that the test would be based on the readings he gave us, and based on how short they were and the fact that I have had other bad professors do the same thing, I assumed he was just going to reuse quiz questions on the final. Rather than studying normally I dug through my old quizzes and made a document with every question and correct answer. Over the course of a few evenings I studied the paper as much as I could and got to the point where I had memorized the answer to all   questions.

Last Friday I showed up to take my exam, I sat down in my desk with nothing but a pencil and was ready to take my test. When he handed me my exam I was absolutely stoked to see that the first question was the first question from quiz  . I answered it quickly and started to scan the page and realized that the final was every quiz question (with some removed to make the test   questions) in chronological order.

It took me about   minutes to finish the exam, and in hindsight I realize I probably should have sat around for a while but I was hungry and wanted to leave so I went to his desk, turned in my test, was told I would get my grade on Monday at  am and left.

Fast forward to today and instead of getting a grade I got an email asking for me to come to my professor's office.

Worst ice-breaker ever.My professor decided to go around the (virtual) room and have us each say our names and what internship we had this summer to break the ice.

I, luckily, had found a research position over the summer, so I was able to talk about mine, but I spent as little time as possible on it. 

Nobody wants to gloat about their internships when over half of the class lost theirs, and nobody who lost theirs wants to get up in front of the class and talk about how they lost it.

1592159754.0,college,"Stop looking down on people for their choice of major I am tired of people telling me that my major is ""useless"" and that I'll never use it in the real world if I don't go to grad school. I'm tired of people judging me for spending MY money (I pay for my own college, my parents don't help out) on something that I enjoy doing. I'm tired of people judging others for majoring in something ""useless"" or ""easy"" or ""low-paying"" while being completely ignorant of what others go through. So, to all the people who have majors that correlate to well-paying, specific entry-level jobs post-college and constantly berate others for trying to live THEIR lives, pay close attention.

 . Not everyone wants to do what you do. Do you ever think about that? We don't all want to be software engineers or nurses or business analysts etc. People have different interests and enjoy having the freedom to pursue those interests. If people want to study anthro, let them do it. If they want to study music, let them! Don't be an asshole. You would be surprised by all of the opportunities you don't know exist that people in the ""useless"" majors have that you could never dream of.
 . Not everyone has the aptitude for it. Yeah, I'm tired of hearing people tell others ""wHY diDN't yoU JuST do ENGinEEriNG?"" as if they know the person they are telling this to better than they know themselves. Stuff like that requires a higher level of understanding of math and science that not everyone can ""just do."" Just because it's easy for you or you are driven to succeed in it doesn't mean everyone else can. Forcing people into engineering or comp sci (for example) when they aren't good at math or coding only for them to get a  .  GPA and learn nothing and not get any internships because of their horrendous academic performance isn't going to do anyone any good.
 . Going off of the last point, just because someone isn't cut out for a certain major doesn't make them stupid. We are all different and we are all naturally good at different things. For example, I hate public speaking and being in front of people. I would be an awful performing arts/theatre major. Does that make me stupid? Of course not. I am not a big fan of working with kids all day. I know for a fact I would not be able to handle majoring in elementary education. Does not being able to handle the elementary ed curriculum make me a failure? No, it doesn't. Everyone has their own limitations and it's nothing to be ashamed of. I would like you to consider how well you would do if you were suddenly placed in a major like that.
 . Just because you think your major is ""hard"" that doesn't automatically mean everyone else's majors are ""easy."" I get it, especially as a science major myself. We tend to think that we are on more difficult path because of the coursework. However, that doesn't mean ours is harder, it just means it's hard in a different way. For instance, philosophy majors have to become really good at critical thought, which is an excellent skill to have and something most of us are severely lacking. Education majors have to become very knowledgeable in a subject area and be able to teach it to kids/teens/etc, which is something I think would be incredibly difficult. Classics majors, depending on the school, develop a high level of understanding of Greek and Latin and learn to write well in these languages, which is an amazing ability because writing in English is already hard enough. I encourage you all to check out the curriculums of these so-called ""easy"" majors.
 . Not everyone is motivated by money. Yes, money is good, I agree. However, there are people out there that want to pursue something they are passionate about and couldn't care less how much it paid. It is far better to study something you want to study and take a lower paying job and being happy with it than it is to study something just because ""it's going to get me money"" and then be miserable for the next   years of your life.
 . You don't have to go into the field that you majored in. I know this is gonna be a hard pill for all you specific entry level job majors to swallow, but it's true. You can take the skills you learned in any major and apply them broadly. If you know how to market yourself and you take advantage of the opportunities that are presented to you or the one's that you seek out, then you will be fine. Do you honestly think people don't have a plan? Yes, I am sure some don't, but the majority do have some sort of direction they are looking towards going and they have a college degree to help them out.

In conclusion, stop judging people for choosing what THEY want to do with THEIR college experience. All majors are respectable and offer something unique to the world. No major is useless and no major is easy and some people want more out of life than money.

1573592578.0,college,"Writing Prof Here: How to Add to Essay Length Without Fluff or Format CheatingAlright folks, instead of the normal depressing content on the sub, Christmas is coming early ...though perhaps a bit boring. This is like getting socks. But hey, I know a lot of you need socks, so it's not that bad.

Common problem I'm sure a lot of you are facing is how to reach essay minimum page requirements. I'm here to help. This is only really looking at one specific technique, there's lots of others, and maybe I'll do write ups on them also. The key here though is that this *isn't* about just padding your essay. It's about reaching the minimum length *by doing what you're actually expected to do.* It's like cheating on a test by smuggling notes in your brain.

Let's take a hypothetical essay discussing polarizing foods. Here's a stereotypically bad bit of (hypothetical) student writing:

>One food that causes a lot of debate is pineapple on pizza. In Haidt's article he finds that  % of people hate pineapple on pizza. This clearly shows pineapple is one of the most controversial foods on pizza.

Shit. We just covered pineapple in like   lines of text. That was going to be the centerpiece of the essay!

To improve on this, always look for more clarity, depth, and specificity. We'll start with the first sentence. ...Is there evidence of this debate we can point to?

>One food that causes a lot of debate is pineapple on pizza. For instance, a Reddit post ranked pineapple on pizza as the most controversial food.

Good start, but what lots of details are missing.

>For instance, a Reddit post on the popular r/askreddit forum asked community members what food they found to be the most controversial and pineapple was the clear winner.

Better, but we're using an internet sources a lot of folks aren't familiar with. Is it credible? More detail helps:

>For instance, a Reddit post on the popular r/askreddit forum asked community members what food they found to be the most controversial. The post received a net  ,  upvotes and  ,  comments. The highest voted comment was for pineapple on pizza. But, pineapple on pizza wasn't just the top response; it also ranked  th,  th, and  th.

Our first sentence has now become longer than the entire original paragraph just be expanding on the ""causes a lot of debate"" idea. Now let's move on to ""In Haidt's article he finds that  % of people hate pineapple on pizza.""

First we need to tell the audience who this guy is.

>Jonathan Haidt is an ethics professor at the NYU Stern School of Business and has written extensively on the subject of disgust.

After that, we should give more detail about just what the study found (I'm making up the study, btw, but Haidt does study disgust). We should provide more detail about the specific research results, and can add a bit of narrative about the research methods as well.

>In a study of   college students in New York City, Haidt found that on a scale of   to   where   is ""strongly dislike"" and   is ""strongly like,""  % of respondents ranked pineapple on pizza at  , while  % ranked it at  . Only  % put it in the middle with a rank of  .

In the original,  % disliking it didn't actually tell us it was controversial, it told us only a lot of people hate it -- but we need to know how many like it as well, and the number of ambivalent people is another useful detail. We can go into more depth with some added context drawn from other questions in the study:

>While pineapple had  % of all respondents answering   or  , sausage only had  % in either category, with only  % saying they strongly dislike it.

Good, that tells us how it compares to an uncontroversial topping. How does it rate among other controversial toppings though?

>Compared to other controversial toppings, pineapple is still very polarizing. For instance, olives only had  % ranking it   or  , bell peppers had  %, and mushrooms were at  %. The only thing with more results at the extremes was anchovies with  % having a strong opinion, though  % ranked it at  , showing it isn't controversial, just universally disliked.

Holy cow, now we've got ourselves a real life college essay paragraph. Let's put the pieces together and see how she looks:

>One food that causes a lot of debate is pineapple on pizza. For instance, a Reddit post on the popular r/askreddit forum asked community members what food they found to be the most controversial. The post received a net  ,  upvotes and  ,  comments. The highest voted comment was for pineapple on pizza. But, pineapple on pizza wasn't just the top response; it also ranked  th,  th, and  th. Jonathan Haidt is an ethics professor at the NYU Stern School of Business and has written extensively on the subject of disgust. In a study of   college students in New York City, Haidt found that on a scale of   to   where   is ""strongly dislike"" and   is ""strongly like,""  % of respondents ranked pineapple on pizza at  , while  % ranked it at  . Only  % put it in the middle with a rank of  . While pineapple had  % of all respondents answering   or  , sausage only had  % in either category, with only  % saying they strongly dislike it. Compared to other controversial toppings, pineapple is still very polarizing. For instance, olives only had  % ranking it   or  , bell peppers had  %, and mushrooms were at  %. The only thing with more results at the extremes was anchovies with  % having a strong opinion, though  % ranked it at  , showing it isn't controversial, just universally disliked.

That's more than half a page (TNR  , double spaced).

Now what about the last line from the original? ""This clearly shows pineapple is one of the most controversial foods on pizza.""

Cut it. Don't need it. If I clearly showed you something, I don't need to tell you that I clearly showed you it. You know.

But wait, we're not done! We can get even more mileage out of this by commenting on the limitations of the study:

>It should be noted that the study was only of college students in New York City, and there may be a regional preference.

Again, we can expand this with greater levels of detail and specificity.

>It should be noted that the study was only of college students in New York City, and regional preferences may have influenced the results. Food preferences and traditions are known to vary from one region to the next, and pizza in particular has regional variations such as the Chicago deep dish. It may be that in some places were pineapple is more popular, pineapple on pizza is less of a contentious issue.

And, if you need to squeeze a little more mileage out of it, add a bit of your research narrative:

>However, in researching this topic, I was not able to find a study that compared regional attitudes towards pineapple on pizza.

That's all there is to it.

...One huge caveat of course. Expanding your writing in this way first requires that you have a clue what the heck you're talking about. You need to have done the research, have actual good sources, and understand the sources and your subject to be able to discuss it in a nuanced manner.

Original Post:

I didn’t even know that this was humanly possible, but I did it. Somehow. 

I had this paper that was assigned in MARCH and my professor repeatedly told us all over and over again throughout the semester, “please do not wait until the last minute to write this paper. I promise you will regret it. Please please start it early and do a little bit each day.”

Well what did my dumbass do? I started the paper   hours before it was due. I have never regretted a decision so much in my entire life. I’ve always said that I have no regrets, but for the first time in my life, I have a regret.

I was crying the whole time while writing this paper and felt intense anxiety the entire   hours but I did it. I somehow fucking did it. I genuinely did not think I would pull it off but somehow I submitted all   pages at  :  PM, just minutes before the deadline.

Now granted, they were   pages of pure dogshit and I’m probably gonna get a horrible grade but hey, given the circumstances I’m proud I at least finished it and powered through.

If y’all want an update once I find out my grade, let me know.

EDIT: A lot of you have been asking what the paper was so I’ll go ahead and explain. It wasn’t a research paper luckily so no sources needed or anything like that. It was for my marketing class and throughout the entire class we did a marketing simulation project where we had to run a business and marketing campaign selling products and it was divided into quarters. So the paper was basically explaining every single business decision you made in the simulation for each quarter and WHY you made that decision and what the result of each decision was and reflecting on the results so mentioning what you would have done differently, etc. Sounds like it wouldn’t take too long or be too difficult but you’d be surprised lol because overall there were A LOT of decisions made during the simulation and you had to go in depth on every one of them.",2336,435,0

It can be any course as long as it’s in the certain subject, so I found a freshman level course being offered online by a local community college to take.  I’m only   weeks in and I have a new empathy for my students.

As a student, I am incredibly anxious and perfectionist.  I have two bachelors and a masters degree, both of which I received with honors.  I’m a life long learner and quite honestly very interested in the subject matter of the class and have a good background in it, so I’m not sure if I am humbled or annoyed by my first test grade.

I very honestly studied.  The professor puts up power points to read and question guides to answer along with the power points.  I read EVERYTHING she posted, and I mean everything.  There were fyi handouts and videos that I read and viewed.  I filled in the review sheets.  I went back and reviewed the sheets and power points before the test.  I printed out the power points so I could have them as reference during the test as allowed.

So I kinda feel, if you have a student who is also a teacher, with a master degree, taking your freshman level course who can only get a  ….either something is wrong with the testing material or the teaching material.  Most of the questions I felt I knew with confidence but there were several that I felt were either super wordy to be confusing on purpose or I could have made a case for multiple correct answers.  I feel like I can clearly explain the material and the conclusions the professor is asking us to draw, but that is clearly not reflected in the grade.  I can not possibly imagine how a student right out of high school or brand new to college would have done well on that test.  I feel like they would be crying at the computer at the overload of information they were being asked to synthesize.

I know that not everyone gets A’s in everything.  Again, maybe just my ego is a bit bruised and I’m eating a slice of humble pie because I thought taking a freshman level course would be relatively easy for me.  I guess if you take anything from my ramble it’s to not beat your self up over not getting perfect grades all the time.  Sometimes even if you try your hardest, a   is the best you can get.

Little update: one of the questions I though was formatted incorrectly (like it was entered in as a single answer but should have been a multi answer) was confirmed to be incorrect by the professor and I was allowed to answer that question and gain the points there.  The professor also wrote me a nice email that once the test closes we could discuss the questions I got wrong as she felt the wording could have been tricky to understand.  So I do want to give her credit for a)responding quickly and kindly and b)being open to reflecting on the question integrity.

Other update: Thanks for everyone who commented and shared stories! I didn’t expect so many responses to my whining ha!  I have definitely learned a lot.  And yes, you can be a college professor with out a PhD.  My official title is assistant professor and I am tenure track.

Annnnddd one more update: The professor shared the class data, the class low was a  , the mean a  , the high a  .  She felt two questions were not worded properly so they were thrown out.

I'm a senior in my fall semester and I'm enrolled in Calculus   at a university I won't disclose. I've been struggling this semester with personal issues and decided to withdrawal from this particular course. The deadline to withdraw is not for another month so I've stayed enrolled to prepare for my second attempt and that leads me to my current issue. 

About   weeks ago, midterm   was scheduled. I didn't attend because I'm planning on withdrawing. Yesterday they posted the results and for some reason I got an  %. Before the exam I had  % in the class and now I'm at a  % which means it's possible for me to pass the course (above  %).

I honestly feel like I should email the professor and do the right thing but I wanted to know what everyone else thought. I've been thinking of nothing since when I saw the wrong grade and I have no idea what to do. Thanks in advance for the help!

EDIT: Just thought I'd update those who are curious. I decided to attend office hours a few days after this and explained the whole situation.

The second half of the assignment was reading the country's national transit company's website and watching their COVID-specific informational/rule videos and reading a commuter blog FAQ about the new restrictions. 

None of the information is anything radically different than the guidance we're getting from credible medical professionals in the United States, so there's no real ""cultural difference""  learning goal involved in researching the other country's protocols.

I was taking notes for about   minutes, but unfortunately, the monotone documentary mixed with my sleep deprivation got the best of me and I fell asleep for  -  minutes before waking back up and continuing to take notes. I felt terrible because I do not like falling asleep in class, and I rarely ever fall asleep in class to begin with. The professor did not say anything about it, and while I felt guilty, I continued with my day.

This morning at  : , I got an email from him titled ""You should be better."" Curious about what he was referring to, I opened it, and this is what the email said: 

&#x B;

""I hesitated to send this email, but I think you could benefit from this feedback.

You're lucky you were sitting in the back -- if you were up front I would have woken you up and told you to get out of my class.

You should call whoever is bankrolling you right now and apologize for throwing away their money. Tell them you will be better and then

BE BETTER.

&#x B;

Hope this helps you,

B (placeholder name)""

&#x B;

I might understand if this was a continuous thing or if I was falling asleep during a lecture that he was leading, but this seems like an unprofessional and honestly unreasonable email to send, especially considering he sent the email almost   hours after class. Am I wrong for thinking this? Is this something acceptable for a professor to email a student? 

I would like to go to the department dean or someone of similar status, but this professor is a tenured professor. Is there anything I can do/anyone I can talk to about this?

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Edit:
I did not end up sending him an email as I figured it was best to talk in person with him. I talked to him in person today - He said he wasn’t upset with me, he is simply wanting to encourage me to reach my full potential. He even apologized to me saying sorry he could not be more influential to me. I still think his initial email was unprofessional, but after our conversation I do not believe I will be pursuing any additional form of “retaliation”.",2467,458,0

During one of my first labs, he kept asking about what I was doing after this/tomorrow/the weekend. He was also extremely eager to help me, and would ignore my lab partner, which I found strange because he was struggling more than I was. I was a bit uncomfortable, but I wasn’t sure it was flirting and so I ignored it. The next couple labs went well, he didn’t really have an opportunity to talk to me but I hoped it was just a one time thing.

Today, we were doing a lab with a long wait time, so he was talking to me and another group for a while. The other group finished and left, and then all his attention was on me (ignoring my lab partner again). It started with a continuation of his conversation with the other group, about hobbies and academics. He asked what I do on the weekends and seemed upset when I said I drive home for the weekend. He asked if I like clubbing, and when I said no, he said he’ll bring me out of my shell? He also told me I’m free to visit his apartment and he’d show me how to play a game, and asked for my Snapchat. I didn’t know how to say no, but I’m pretty uncomfortable with all of this. 

I’m not sure what to do now. I’m uncomfortable with this and feel like this is somewhat inappropriate because he’s my TA, but idk if this is serious enough to talk to my prof or the title   person about. I also don’t really want him to know I talked to someone about it, but as far as I know, he’s only doing it to me. Any advice?


EDIT: thanks guys, I had a feeling I’d have to tell someone about this but I hate conflict so I didn’t want to haha. Also thanks for confirming it’s super weird, my parents didn’t take it super seriously when the first incident happened but I think they’re actually going to be helpful now.

I’m falling behind in most of my   courses this semester. Still better than last semester though. I thought about taking a break but it’s my last year and loans and everything...I figured I’d just stick it out.

Dear ______,

How are you doing? I'm writing to check in with you. I haven't heard from you in this class yet and I'd like to connect with you to figure out how I can best support you. These are difficult times and I'm more than happy to be flexible with the course.

Let me know if you want to chat over video or phone, or just check in through email.

Best,

I honestly teared up. It’s a small class, probably around   people, so I’m not surprised he noticed. He already has a “no penalty for late work” policy his semester that I’ve definitely been taking advantage of. 

It was just so nice to receive. To be reached out to instead of having to reach out (which is really hard sometimes). Even motivated me to make more of an effort to get stuff done for his sake. I’ll try this weekend. I haven’t replied yet, but of course I’ll thank him and be honest.

I know I did well on the final too as I prepared so hard for it. He told me he can’t just give me a grade so he wanted me to retake it but it was an in person exam but I had already left the country for the holidays.

He was very strict this entire semester and my daily grades is not even a true reflection of my knowledge in the course material since he would subtract   points etc for not putting screenshots of inputs when he only requested for screenshots of the results. 

I already sent this to our grad officer but I won’t hear back until the uni resumes on Jan  rd. This is causing me so much anxiety. I just really wish he could find my exam.

1604426993.0,college,"An Honest Letter from Your University President About Fall and Our Plans for SpringDear faculty and students,

Oh, and staff. I keep doing that. If I had any shame at all, I’d feel embarrassed. It’s so hard to remember people that don’t have academic freedom. You’re like Gen X; angsty and frequently forgotten in conversation.

I’m writing to follow up on my original post: [An Honest Letter from Your University President About Why We’re Opening This Fall](

First, I’d like to address the disappointing survey results we received from you. Yes, faculty, over  % of the student body is currently in quarantine or isolation, but we gave you a Zoom license and a  p webcam with a microphone that captures all sound within a two and a half foot radius. Be resilient. This sounds like a “You” problem. If you need help, ask the instructional technology group that we’ve underfunded for the past decade and kept on a hiring freeze even after they lost a quarter of their staff to private industry. 

And please stop asking if the students in quarantine are okay. They’re perfectly safe in the Holiday Inn down the road. No, the bad one. Dining Services is making sure they get their meals at least three times a week. Breakfast is an overripe grapefruit and Saltines. The vegetarian option is a chicken salad sandwich. We include a  oz bottle of water. That’s  oz per meal! For those of you who’ve asked: the wifi matches the quality of a strong home internet connection from  , so don’t let them lie to you when they get kicked out of your hybrid/flexible/in-person/circus/flipped/blended/shitshow/mishmash/Sisyphean instruction on Zoom because “their internet cut out”. They’re fine. 

Students: We built our entire reopening plan around your ability to do something all  -  year-olds excel at: Self control. Yes, this has led to a massive uncontrolled outbreak on campus, which is why we need to assign blame to the people who’ve done the most to create these incredibly dangerous circumstances: **You**. I cannot believe that when freed from the restrictions of home life with your parents, the first thing you decide to do is try to *make friends*. I mean, who does that? It's not like we've spent your entire lives selling you on the college experience. We’re trusting you.

Faculty: Since we don’t trust the ~~scapegoats~~ students, and to reassure the business faculty who are assigning tests that Pearson and McGraw Hill wrote in  , we’ve invested heavily in Proctorio. This will allow us to surveil the students from the discomfort of their apartment or dorm room (sorry, “residence hall”). Blinking more than   times in a minute, wearing red sweatpants, or having dark skin will automatically fail the student and trigger a meeting with the student conduct board. Via Zoom, of course. 

Now then, on to spring. I know many of you are feeling tired from not having any fall break, but good news! This proves we can get through a semester without *any* break. Maybe even \[drum roll\] spring break! That’s right! Instead of a much-needed break in the middle of one of the coldest, darkest, most uncomfortable times of the year with no major holidays or time off between January and April, we’ve opted to eliminate spring break in  . For those of you feeling stressed, we encourage you to try any of the following meditative exercises our Wellness Czar/CFO has provided:

* Spend time reflecting on how lucky you are to have a job. 
* Create a spreadsheet of how expensive it’d be to take a job at the next closest university  .  miles away. 
* Disconnect from social media.
* Calculate the chances someone with COVID actually washed their hands properly after they left the communal bathroom you just used. 
* Make a list of how many days it’d take for you to become homeless if you quit right now. 

If you are a faculty or staff member who fought us tooth and nail for accommodations to work remotely this fall, this does mean you’ll need to re-apply for spring. The application process will require you to submit the following to HR: A form with a detailed rationale about why you need accommodations (with citations in MLA  th edition format), two doctor’s notes (one must be from your dentist), a Starbucks gift card with exactly $ .  left on it, blood samples from your children that you personally extracted, a fourth grade report card (doesn’t have to be yours), the last five digits of your mother’s social security number, and President Obama’s long form birth certificate. The original. If you cannot provide these things, your application will be rejected. This policy should help the administration continue its decades-long tradition of disproportionately disenfranchising our female faculty and staff who have children *and* the desire to follow a meaningful career path in their field. 

Now to answer some other questions you’ve been collectively ~~pestering us with~~ asking:

No, we will not acknowledge the backbreaking burden of the affective labor staff have been doing since March. I don’t care if you’re not “fine”. Do the same thing I’m convinced you do when you say you’re working remotely: Pretend you are. Our faculty need strong, reassuring leadership, which is why  you as the people tasked with executing the mission we've created with no input, representation, or feedback from you are going to provide it. Act like everything’s normal and do it with a smile, sweetheart. 

No, we will not be paying the Student Life staff more despite the extraordinary circumstances. We let them live for free in the same dorms as their COVID-infected classmates, who they are now required to check in on daily so my administrative assistant can tell these annoying parents that their student’s taken care of when they call. The dozens of hours of overtime this semester on top of their regular courseload mean nothing. You thought we meant it when we said ""Their first job is being a student?"" Bahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, oh that was good. Wait wait, let me get the senior staff on a Zoom call so you can say that again. They're going to love this! Oh, and tell the RAs to consider this semester a life lesson on what it means to be on salary, and that “Other duties as assigned” is a literal statement. 

Yes, this semester has put the Black, Hispanic, and Latinx members of our community at higher risk since they're disproportionately represented on our environmental services and dining staff. But if they don’t like it, they can just go get another job. It’s not like we’re in the midst of a second generational recession. I mean could you even *imagine*? 

No, we will not be doing pass/fail this semester. Why does everyone keep asking that? Be resilient! When I was a junior in college I got strep throat and was out of class a whole afternoon! I did the work to keep up despite the massive hurdles placed in front of me, and I expect the same of our students. 

I feel this must be said in closing: You all seem to have forgotten that a key part of the administration’s COVID strategy is **Performative Normalcy**, so don’t expect your “pedagogical mission” or “safety” to trump our operations. We are back in-person for a reason: **Money**. I don’t know how you missed this. We sent it via email at  :  on last Friday,   minutes after we’d sent another email announcing the largest uncontrolled outbreak of the semester. Contact your supervisor if you need productivity tips for managing your email.

I don’t do this often as I have a packed schedule during the school year. But, on rare occasions when I do have a day off and no plans, I like to study in the dining hall and it’s like unlimited food pretty much. 

ANYWAY, I shared this with one of my friends when she asked me what I’ll do over the weekend and she said that’s not the most ethical thing to do. now I feel kind of guilty but at the same time tuition is mad expensive and even tho I’m prob not saving much, it makes me feel better. also, it’s a really nice study spot. esp since they have desert and ice cream lol 

should I stop doing this??

thank you to everyone who shared their thoughts, and I really appreciate everyone’s perspective on this.

1594490199.0,college,"Tips for the students who are worried about their college classes being all online and won’t be able to focus since they are basically self-teaching themselvesI highly recommend you guys buy the book “The Science of self-learning” that book really helped me when I was teaching myself my classes since I had two semesters in the row of all online classes (This was before covid). Also make sure you guys right every due date down. Personally I use the app “My Homework Student Planner” since I can write all my due dates down and it will give me a notification on the day of when my assignments are due so I can due that same day. It helps because I have a lot of doctor appointments because of my disability and I can easily forget if I have homework due if I don’t have a physical reminder so that text notification is really helpful.

Edit: The book “The Science of Self-learning” is by Peter Hollins

Edit Edit: Holy shit!   upvotes?!!! I don’t deserve this many I just wanted to share some tips since I did whole year of online classes and can offer some advice but thank you so much.

Edit x : if you need help focusing while studying I recommend downloading the app “Forest”. It’s an that uses the pomodoro technique. Basically you set the timer in the app and watch a tree grow. If you take your phone off the forest to go web search or something like that tree will die and and you have to start over. Most people don’t wanna see a tree die so it helps forces you to get off your phone and actually focus on what you are doing in that moment.

Edit x : If you have problems with retaining info then I suggest you write you notes in class on paper and then transfer to computer app such as Microsoft OneNote or Evernote. Since you are rewriting it you naturally will retain more of it.",1793,336,0

TLDR; I thrive on schedule but have to legitimately force myself to stick to them. I used these tips to stay on the Dean's List, procrastinate mindfully, stop wasting time on studying ineffectively, and ease the stress of   college hours with my   homeschooled kids and a job.

-MAKE A WORKSPACE: Make a little area that you keep your school stuff at. Sit there an hour a day to work, make important phone calls, ect. Your ""adulting"" spot. Dont doodle there. Dont eat dinner there. Dont play video games there. Even if it's a backpack, chair, and a tv tray. Mine is a desk in a closet. Decorate meaningfully. A school vision board and an erasable calendar maybe. 

-If you can, take notes on one word document so that you can search your notes instantly for a keyword. 

-MAKE TIME (just a little) to actually work. Everyday. Like a job. Even when you have no work to do, sit down at your desk for a bit every day and find something important to do that is unpleasant/has been put off and do it in that ""work time"". Make that appointment you havent made, call the matenience to fix the dishwasher you have been not using for a week bc you havent called, do whatever and limit the adulting to that hour and do it everyday. You'd be surprised how much an hours of actual work can get done if its consistent. But consistency is hard for me so I have to enforce it. My kids have an hour or so of nap/quiet time in their rooms while I work, and I rarely if ever need more time than that. Most of the time I spend outside of that is on important tests that cant be interrupted. 

-RITUALS: No not those. But you cant just sit down and expect to switch gears. Do something everytime you sit down to work that gets you ""in the zone."" Maybe it's a cup of water and a journal, or checking your calendar or whatever, or even a cigarette and   minutes of a game that you only play right before you buckle down, set a timer. Setting out   minutes  or so to sit at my desk and bullshit actually makes me work better. 

-ONLY HIGHLIGHT key words in notes and textbooks. If the course has many dates and names, consider highlighting those in a seperate color.

- COMBINE POWERPOINTS all the teachers powerpoints she sends out into one giant  PowerPoint that you can search for keywords efficiently.

-COPY AND PASTE all test questions that allow it into ONE master document of test questions for each class: if you can correct the wrong answers after, even better. This takes no time if you do it during the tests, or print screen after you've taken it. Not all classes allow this, though.

-INDEX everything that you cant search easily. If you do it as you go, it's easy but it's hard to get started. 

-  *Leave it for the due date* , if you have to, but not the night it's due. Work in the morning. Trust me. Wake up at the same time everyday. Do something pleasant for a limited time and then work until you're done for the day. Then you can enjoy you're whole day without the clock ticking down to  : PM when that quiz is due that you've known about for   weeks and havent done. It's going to happen, it always will, but it you do it that morning, you will always feel better. 

- Bring your snack or drink with you and dont get up, if you can manage that.

1698422167.0,college,"my class has an absolutely ridiculous attendance policySomeone please try to understand the logic of this attendance policy. Now my class has lecture twice a week and a discussion section once a week. We have an attendance grade that's worth  % of our grade for lecture and an attendance/participation grade worth  % for our discussion classes. 

Now in the syllabus it states that every absence from class results in a  % grade deduction of your overall grade. That seemed completely illogical because whats the point of an attendance grade if you get docked a whole letter grade for missing class anyways right? So I went ahead and asked one of the TAs about that at the beginning of the semester and they told me that that policy only applies to our discussion sections which made sense to me. 

Now midway through the semester after I've already missed countless lectures but   discussion classes, I'm being told that the policy applies to lectures as well......

Whats the point of an attendance grade if you're losing a whole ass letter grade for missing class anyways?!?!?!

Edit: After some backlash, I wanted to clarify some things. I asked a TA about this policy **before** I started missing classes, and they explicitly told me that it did not apply to lectures. I also asked a separate TA a few weeks into class to double check, and they told me the same thing.

 .) You know what kind of person you are. By this I mean, if you want your room to be cute and decorated, don't let someone convince you that it's a waste of money/time. I loved having a cozy room to come back to and made lots of friends due to them wanting to hang out in my room.

 .) This also means you know what you use. Don't bring a water bottle if you never use one now. Don't bring that piece of clothing you haven't worn in months because it will just take up space.

 .) Keep the pandemic situation in mind. You probably don't need to pack swim suites because pools won't be open anyways. Also, stuff like a printer may not be as necessary as most classes will turn things in digitally (unless you need it to scan things)

 .) Also with the pandemic in mind, pack lightly and keep containers in your room. You want to be able to move out at a moments notice if things get really bad again.

 .) You will need a lot less clothes than you think you do but will probably overpack anyways. If you haven't worn something by the time you go home for your first break, take it home with you.

 .) If drinking/smoking isn't your thing, don't worry! There are plenty of people who choose not to for whatever reason and most people are respectful of this.

 .) If you do go out partying, you leave and come back with the same people. You make sure everyone got home safe and sound (especially the girls in your group). Don't let your girl friends walk alone at night.

 .) Probably an unpopular opinion but don't be afraid to cut your friends off if they've had too much. It's not cool to pressure someone into drinking more than their bodies can handle. Look out for all of your friends and if they don't do that for you, find new friends.

 .) If someone passes out from drinking, *PLEASE* roll them onto their side. Lots of people die every year from choking on vomit while unconscious.

 .) This may be obvious, but try your best in classes and put them above all else. You pay so much money, to do otherwise would be silly. I say this as someone who partied A LOT and still had straight A's, it's important you find a balance.

 .) Bring a basic first aid kit and some basic OTC medicine. I was very happy to have fever reducer and ibuprofen on standby when I got tonsillitis a month into school.

 .) Lots of people say a TV is a waste but we used ours a lot. Especially with the pandemic happening, you should expect to be inside a lot more anyways. (Same goes for PC set ups)

 .) You'll soon learn that people weren't raised the same as you. Set guidelines with your roommates about cleaning/partying/bringing people over ect. during the first couple days of school. Also, bring up issues with your roommates as soon as they're on your radar.

 .) Be safe if you're hooking up. Let a friend/roommate know where you're going, I found using snap location made me feel safer. Also wrap it up!

 .) Some stuff that I brought that was never used included: Ear plugs, desk lamp, paper clips, post its, water bottle, swimsuit. It all depends on the person though. Ear plugs are good to bring just in case, better to have and not need than to never have them at all.

 .) If you have a car on campus, maybe keep that low key unless you want people asking for rides all the time.

 .) Be safe. Wear a mask outside your dorm at all times. To not do this is so selfish and you're not only endangering yourself, but those around you and everyone they come into contact with. Maybe you would be fine if you got covid, but the asthmatic kid down the hall may not be so lucky. You are not invincible and life will soon show you otherwise if you think that.

1595043120.0,college,"Safety Tips for college womenI am reposting from a list made by girls at my school. 

 . Share location with good friends. I understand you don’t want your parents tracking you but it is a good idea for your friends to know where you are or your last location in the event you go missing or need help sent to you. If you have a date that night let someone know. 

 . Be very cautious when meeting anyone from online for the first time including tinder, bumble etc. when meeting someone for the first time meet them in public or in your housing. Do not go alone to a strangers house. You could be assaulted by the person your meeting or worse walk into a set up. 

 . Have your own alcohol (I would include drugs in this too) Do not take random drinks from anyone including other women. Bring your own alcohol to parties or stick to sealed beverages such as cans or drinks being served to everyone such as beer from a keg. Avoid any random concoctions. 

 . Drink among friends. Do not go out alone always have at least one friend with you. Be aware of each other’s where abouts throughout the party. 

 . Make sure everyone is accounted for. Everyone who came together leaves together. (I personally have seen this problem happen) While going out in a large group of friends may seem safer but it is not. The more girls, the easier it is to lose someone without realizing. If two girls go out they are unlikely to leave each other during the party and you would notice immediately if the only person you know is missing. In a group of friends it can be easy to lose someone because of diffusion of responsibly, everyone is talking to someone else, someone must know where she is mentality. It is easy to lose one girl when party or bar hopping throughout the night in a group. Keep track of your friends. 

 . Do not go to the bathroom alone. (I personally know of a girl who was followed into a bathroom and raped while at a house party) This one is more so for house parties than bars as bar bathrooms aren’t single stall so many women are in there at once also bar staff tends to keep an eye on bathrooms for all sorts of reasons. Bring a friend into the bathroom with you or at least to stand outside. It is very easy at a party for a predator to follow a girl into a bathroom and for bystanders to assume they are a couple looking for privacy. Never use a bathroom in a secluded part of the house alone.  If you are followed into a bathroom scream your head off for help. People will care I promise. 

 . Make sure your phone is charged before you go anywhere. You do not want to be in a situation where you are unable to call   or a friend or an Uber. Keep your phone on you as much as possible. 

 . Always have a healthy level of caution in a professional or educational setting. Meet professors before class instead of after. Schedule one on one meetings in less secluded places if the option is given to you. Such as meeting a tutor in a library instead of dorm room. Bring a friend along if the matter is not confidential when meeting a professor or other college staff member. 

 . Have a healthy level of caution among friends. Predators are stereotyped as strangers who hide in bushes but many sex crimes are committed by a person who knows the victim such as a friend of a friend, friends boyfriend or brother or even a friend themself. Be careful where you sleep. Always sleep in your own bed whenever possible. Do not sleep on a friends couch in a house with many people in the house. 
Be selective about who sleeps in your house as well. 

 . Just because someone attends the same school as you does not mean you “know them”. Many girls who would never dream going back to a strangers house think it’s safe to go back to the room or house of someone they just met simply because they are also a student at that school. This person is still a stranger. 

 . Other women are not always friends. (This one applies mostly to sex trafficking and abductions) Many girls are lured by other women into being victimized. Predators are often smart and realize women are much less suspicious of other women. Be wary of anyone who randomly approaches you with a “job offer” like modeling or photography. A random woman in social media trying to get you to meet her somewhere is another one. 

 . Stay away from the worst. In college do not let a little youthful rebellion or college partying make you think there is anything glamorous about a life of crime. You may feel invincible but you are not. There is a very big difference between college kids experimenting with drugs or making fake ids and being a career criminal. Practice good common sense. College aged women are very vulnerable to being manipulated into sex work by drug addict boyfriends or pimps. College is a time for taking risks and having fun but do not take it too far. 

 . Educate yourself on the signs and behaviors of an abusive boyfriend. This will allow you to educate yourself before potentially entering an abusive relationship that will ruin your college years.

 . Do not go home with anyone you met that night. You can give your phone number and agree to meet another day. If you really want to see more of them that night bring them back to your housing. This will you to be in control of the situation and your safety. If they refuse to go to your housing instead of theirs that is a major read flag. Going home with a stranger after drinking leaves you vulnerable to many potential problems or high risk behaviors. Ranging from assault from the person you went home with or his roommates, to impulsive consensual unprotected sex.

 . If you see something not right happening get involved. Be a friend to a girl who needs it. Do not let your school be a place where violence against women is tolerated.",5791,1070,0

I know it's so easy to procrastinate, to push your work aside and cram in the very last minute. You tell yourself that you'll work on it after watching an episode of your show, or after taking a nap because you're too exhausted to start this assignment. After hours of putting off your work, you finally decide to open your laptop and start. You click on the assignment and   minutes later you find yourself on your phone, distracted once again. 

I just wanted to remind you that you are completely capable of acing your classes, of earning the grades you'll be happy with. All it takes is a conscious effort to complete your assignments and set aside time for your studies. 

Procrastination stems from fear, and the key is to do your work despite *feeling* like you want to procrastinate. There is no physical barrier between you and your assignments, it's all mental. So, ground yourself, stop the self sabotaging, and get it done. You’ll feel awesome and accomplished and still have time to do everything else you like. Nothing is above you, nothing is too difficult for you, and you are more than capable of being *that* student.

At this time of year, there seem to be lots of posts about asking to raise your grades.  There is only one acceptable reason to do this, which is if you have good reason to believe that there was a transcription error.  Asking for a higher grade just because you wish you had done better in a class will not work.  Asking for an extra credit assignment at the end of the semester, after your professor has already assigned you a grade lower than you would have liked, will not work.  Not only will it not work, it will hurt your reputation with your professors almost as much as cheating does.

Start saving your drafts when writing to avoid accusations of AI cheating.I've been stumbling across more and more posts of students getting zeroes for writing their own papers. Every day more and more professors are incorporating programs into their grading to detect writing styles similar to Chat GPT, meaning that professors are no longer grading their work by themselves, but instead with the helping hand of an unreliable and inaccurate software. 

That being said, SAVE YOUR DRAFTS! Especially with large essay assignments, you should start savings proof! Your grade is YOURS, and the last thing we should be doing as students is giving our professors the power to discredit our hard work on the basis of internet tools they aren't willing to understand, without any ways of defending ourselves. 

These detectors aren't going anywhere. In fact, they're likely to go even more mainstream, and soon will be affecting  the whole industry. Don't let your professors hold that power over you, because these situations can happen to you, and I want you all to be able to save your grades.

Advice?I am in my final quarter at a community college, and I am admitted to a large university in fall quarter this year and was accepted to my major. My acceptance to the program was contingent upon the completion of one final course, so I was taking the course this summer and was to send my final transcript over once final grades had been posted. Everything was going well, I had a  % in the class, and submitted my final assignment this Tuesday. 

I check my email today and see that my professor gave me a   on the final project, which brought my grade down to a failing grade as it accounted for  % of our total grade. The only feedback she gave was ""You are not allowed to use outside resources and AI generated responses"". I absolutely DID NOT use AI or use any outside resources. The assignment was computational and I showed my work. The only resources I used were notes that I had taken throughout the quarter, most of which were directly paraphrased from her lectures. She gave no rubric for the final project and I don't even understand how she could have extrapolated me using ChatGPT for a math project? 

I am absolutely shocked and I feel so upset. She reported it to the college board which means this will be on my record and I am extremely afraid that my acceptance to the university will be rescinded/revoked. I have worked so, so hard for the past   years and I have never once been accused of cheating or anything of the sort. Has anyone every experienced something like this before? What do I do?

I am scared because i know she’s going to ask to see the version history, but the issue is that I work on google docs and convert to word doc to submit because she only accepts word files. The word doc doesn’t have an edit history because of this, and the file is completely gone from google docs and I cannot recover it seemingly. Fuuuuuu*k me! Thanks for all the support and advice guys!

UPDATE  : Alright so i met with my professor. I don’t know why I was anticipating her to be more understanding of this whole situation, but she was extremely accusatory and confrontational seeming that she was  % certain that I had cheated. Her explanation was that I used a method to solve an equation that she allegedly never showed us, therefore I must have looked it up or had a bot complete the problem for me. I proceeded to tell her that in one of her lectures that she shared (pre recorded from seven years ago, she hasn’t updated anything since), she mentioned this method as one of three acceptable methods of solving the problem. So for the whole quarter, i had been using this method. I even found the video clip of her referencing this method. She back tracked and said that she never provided the specific template for this method, so i must have had to look it up. I showed her that I found the template from the assigned textbook. Then, she proceeded to ask me other impromptu exam questions for me to solve on the spot which I could not do because this is an intro level class and I am not yet equipped to solve these philosophical math questions on a whim. While i tried to answer these questions, she made mocking/confused faces at me.

Once she had prodded me about everything, I simply asked her if she was going to proceed with reporting this to the school board. She said she would not do this, but there were numerous other students that made the same mistake (?) as me that she will be reporting. She did not fix the grade, but will all my completed work, i rounded out to a C and i am okay with that as long as I do not have academic dishonesty on my record.

1606235453.0,college,"Here's what might happen to you if you get caught cheatingWell, I never thought this would happen but it did. As we all know, online courses have been a mess this semester. In particular my chemistry class has been hell. Our average test scores are  %- %. I usually get lower, and chemistry has never been my strong suit. 

Since this is reddit, im not going to lie. On our  rd exam last week I was having trouble with a few questions. Our tests are technically open note, but I went to the one place that is usually off limits: chegg. I searched some questions and some people had clearly copied and pasted the exam questions to chegg, and received answers. To my credit I did look at the explanation of questions and figured out how the answer became to be, but ultimately I did see the answer and therefore put that answer into my exam. 

Yesterday my professor sent an email about how people posted the exam questions on chegg and how my schools Dean Of Students would be contacting chegg to request who posted the questions AND who accessed the questions. He mentioned how the penalties will be lesser if those who cheated came forward on their own. So I did. 

Because I came forward and its my first offense, my punishments include a   on the exam, have to take an online academic integrity course, and get an official report filed at the Dean of Students just to have it on record in case I offend again. The real part that sucks? I work within the Dean of students which makes this  x more embarrassing. Im pretty sure nothing will happen to my employment, but there's still a worry in the back of my mind. 

I never thought about using chegg to be honest. All of my roommates use it even on exams and a lot of other people in my class cheated on this exam as well. Its so common I didn't think anything would happen. But it did and its my mistake and I take the consequences. 

Basically. I want this to be a warning. I've learned a huge lesson, and I deactivated my chegg account. Id rather get a C in the class vs getting suspended from my university. Even though my punishments can be seen as mild, it certainly wasn't worth it.

Edit: there are people calling me dumb and an idiot in the comments because they believe my professor tricked us into confessing. I dont know exactly what to believe, because on cheggs policy they say they can and will give out extensive information on who accessed certain questions, meanwhile threads on r/professor say differently. The point is no matter if I was baited or not, I learned my lesson from looking at chegg and won't be doing it again. I find it takes my integrity to admit mistakes then try to get away with everything. Sometimes its just better to receive the necessary punishment and learn for the future.

Also, everyone is asking why on earth id use my real name on my account. I did so because I truly didn't start my chegg account to cheat, and when I looked at questions during the exam I wasn't even thinking about it because its so common to use chegg. Yes it would have been smarter to not use my name, but understand that I didn't start my chegg account with the direct attention to cheat.",3161,583,0

1632247758.0,college,"Lurking professor with some study hacks... (long)Hi folks, hope you don't find it bothering that I'm a professor who lurks.   But since Covid, I've joined this subreddit because I want to know what's going on with students' mental health, but don't want my students to feel weirded out if I ask.

What I've learned is that a lot of you are Not Doing Okay.   And that Covid-  and online learning is really, really stressing you out.   And I'm sorry that I don't have any good answers for that.

But the other thing I see is people struggling on how to study in college, which is so different from studying in High School.

Unfortunately, a lot of students are missing out on the very thing that would help you out.  **I'm NOT SAYING THIS BECAUSE IT'S WHAT I THINK, I'M SAYING THIS BECAUSE THIS IS THE F\*\*KING SCIENCE.**

There have been SOOOO many epistemological studies about easy things you can change regarding note-taking that will literally improve your grades, your exams, and your general understanding.

Some of you will know all of this already.  But note-taking isn't just something we're born knowing how to do and bugs the hell out of me that no one bothers to ever teach it.

So for those who don't know what are essentially ""study hacks"", here's the science:

# # ) TAKING NOTES BY HAND AUTOMATICALLY STICKS INSIDE YOUR MEMORY MORE THAN TAKING NOTES ON A LAPTOP DOES, EVEN IF YOU NEVER LOOK AT YOUR NOTES AGAIN.

(Link to the study: [ )

When it comes to remembering facts, like ""When did the civil war start?"" there wasn't much of a difference.  

However, when it comes down to understanding the CONCEPTS, students who wrote longhand did unbelievably better.  As in three times better.   If you want to know why they did so much better, go to hack # .

# # ) USING YOUR OWN WORDS TO WRITE DOWN NOTES IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN WRITING DOWN EXACTLY WHAT THE PROFESSOR SAYS IN THE LECTURE.

Directly from the study: ""Overall, p**articipants who took more notes performed better whether or notebook or laptop,** β =  . , p = . , partial R  = . . ***However, those whose notes had less verbatim overlap with the lecture performed \[even\] better,*** β = − . , p = . , partial R  = .   


For instance, if the prof's slide says: 

`""Psychologists have investigated a phenomenon known as “attitude inoculation,” which works on the same principle as vaccination, and involves exposing people to weak arguments against a viewpoint they hold.""`  


Don't write that down verbatim.  Write down what it \*means\* and in your own words.  Something like:

`If you challenge someone's opinion with weak arguments, but a lot of them, they'll actually double-down on their opinion`

Or, for real shorthand, fast

`Lots of weak arguments = they'll double down`

So long as you can tell what that means.

# # ) VISUALS HELP

Draw whatever helps you understand the concept, be it graphs or maps or whatever.   Such as:

It's from a guy that scored  . th percentile in his med school classes, and he attributes it to his note-taking skills:

# # ) HERE'S THE BIG BIG BIG BIG HACK THAT WILL SAVE YOU THE MOST TIME:

Review your notes within twenty-four hours.  This can save you hours of extra studying in the long run.

Make sure it's within   hours though!   Science isn't  % sure why it has to be done within that time frame, but it could be because of (theoretical but certainly not debunked) ""neural dumping.""  Basically, this means as you sleep at night your brain shits out all the information that is non-essential.

Guess what's non-essential:  calculus.  history.  English lit.     Sure, not to you, but to your brain?  It says, ""F\*\*k it, we need the space.  Get rid of this crap.""

Let me know if any of this is helpful, or if it's just mostly annoying stuff that you already know.

Take care guys.  It's only   years of hell, I promise.  After that, it's only   more years of hell in the workforce, but at least it's a different kind of hell.

1583969193.0,college,"Some tips for online classesI saw a lot of stuff on r/college lately from students who have not taken online classes before. Since I teach both online and face-to-face (and have for some time) I thought I'd share some of the tips (and other considerations) with regard to online classes.

Tips:

 . First and foremost, it is WAY easier to skip the work when it's online. I plan on having asynchronous lectures for my switch over to online, but even for those faculty hosting live lectures, it will be much tougher to focus. Try to set up an environment where you can stay focused. Wear actual clothes, get your coffee, act like you would if you were in a face-to-face class so your brain doesn't try to switch into ""relax"" mode on you. Try to watch the videos/lectures around the same time your class would have met since you are already in the routine for it.

 . Take notes like you would in a regular class. Again, when it's online (especially recorded) it might feel silly to take notes. But notes help you learn, face-to-face or otherwise.

 . PARTICIPATE! You will not get to hear other students' questions as much (if at all, depending on the format). There is not really an easy way to do discussions so the more you make an effort to participate, the more everyone will get out of it. If you have questions on the material, for the love of God make sure you ask them because no one else is going to ask them for you as often happens in traditional classes.

 . Exams are probably going to be different. You might get a prof that just throws the multiple choice exam online, but most are aware that it is so easy to cheat online that they will format online exams differently. You will see lots more randomization of questions, question order, and answer choice order. You might see online proctor services like Lockdown Browser or Respondus Monitor that literally lock you out of everything but the exam and then record you taking it via webcam. You might end up getting an open book exam that is much more difficult.

 . Usually, you'd be in class about  .  hours a week and (hopefully) studying and doing some assignments on top of that. You should keep with that pattern. Assume it'll take you ~ .  hours just to go through all the learning content. I think a lot of students just erase the class time from their brain and try to just rush through everything, which would not be possible in a face-to-face. This is another way that setting up a ""class time"" for yourself can really help.

 . Editing to add this one: Every prof is going to do this differently. Some might livestream lectures, some might record them, some might not lecture at all. It is really important you keep an eye on your emails, check your notification settings on Canvas/Blackboard/whatever, and get comfortable with   or   slightly different versions of this.

The best way I can sum this up is that in a traditional class you are often or at least often can get away with being a passive consumer of the content. In an online class you have to be more of an active participant in your own learning. 

Other considerations:

 . Many--MANY--of your professors hate teaching online and have no idea how to do it right. They have never had to before. It is not as simple or easy as it might seem to design a good online learning experience and many faculty have no experience with it and no time to learn. We are all dealing with this change, so try to be patient the best you can. 

 . Be open-minded. I teach a topic that can be put online pretty easily, but I have no clue how you would put a chem lab or an acting class online. And neither do a lot of faculty. This will be testing the creativity of many professors. Every course has learning objectives you are expected to be assessed on, and they will have to find a way to do that.

 . Technical issues are going to be rampant, both because of the pressure put on the learning management systems and because of instructor incompetence + poor user interfaces. Don't start stuff at the last minute. It's not a good idea in general but you run the risk of technical issues preventing you from finishing. Your professors are not tech support either and chances are they have no clue what's wrong. You should probably contact your campus tech support folks for help, not your professor, unless you're sure it's something wrong on their end.

 . Editing to add: Everything is going to be just fine. It's going to be weird. It's going to be an adjustment. But ultimately if you pay attention to your profs and keep up with the work this will just have been an inconvenience in the end.

I'm sure others can chime in with more suggestions or comments. Good luck with the transition.",4716,854,0

And with me being alone with no friends to talk to or wait for the people I know to walk, I just up and left.

I'm considering whether to talk to my professor about this.

Do you think it's worth bringing up with my professor? Has anyone been in a similar situation?

**Update:** Thanks to everyone for the input and advice! I spoke with my professor about the whole scenario and she was very understanding and allowed us to present at a later date.

To provide some context:  The class is actually online, and our presentations were scheduled during a Zoom meeting. Our professor gave us the flexibility to divide the work however we saw fit, even allowing just one person to present if that's what we decided.

I had a midterm at  pm, and our class runs from  :  to  pm. I let my group know about this conflict in advance, and we agreed that I'd handle the entire PowerPoint while the other two would do the presenting. At the time, it didn’t cross my mind to inform my professor about my midterm clash, especially since my group mates had been super reliable throughout the semester.

Everyday since the course began my professor sends out a message via the class Chat feature about some obscure holiday, his dog, or a sports game; until last week. At the start of the course, he informed us he had COVID, so I'm a bit worried. However, there was recently a group of students who asked him to stop with his daily Chat messages as it clouds up their emails. The day my classmates did this was also the last time my professor sent out a message (two hours prior to the message my classmates sent) so I feel like he might have gone silent as per their wishes. Still, he hasn't uploaded our final exam to the Module, or graded the last test we took. As far as I can tell, its just him and his elderly dog. 


Assuming the worst, what do I do? Who do I contact?

Edit: Another classmate and I messaged/emailed our professor a few hours before I posted this.

Update: A classmate said she emailed our professor a few days ago and has not gotten a response. Another classmate has informed us that he has reached out to the department head.

Update  : Another classmate left a voicemail with the Dean's assistant earlier today. She got a response from HR letting her know that the Dean has been in contact with our professor, who is seemingly having technical issues. Looks like we weren't the only ones having trouble reaching him. We're expected to get ""more information regarding this course tomorrow or ASAP"". I will post another update when I hear from the Dean or the professor.

Update  : I received an email from the Department Head just a few hour ago, she says our professor is fine and working to resolve the technical issues. In all honesty, I don't buy it. It has been nearly two weeks since we heard from our professor and he would have realized immediately that there was a problem. Finals are this week, and I would've expect the school to have resolved the issue by now. I think the school knows he passed and doesn't want to tell us until after final exams are over. I hope this isn't the case, but we aren't being given much information. In any case, I'll post another update when I hear from my professor or the Department staff.

Update  : I just finished taking the final for this class. I'm still unsure if it is the professor who uploaded it since the format wasn't given in its usual manner. My writing assignment has been graded, but the rubric is straight forward enough anyone can grade it. Our last test has not been graded and this test does require knowledge of the course to grade properly. There still hasn't been a response to my message from the professor yet. I plan to keep in contact with him over the summer to make sure he's ok. I'll post my final update when grades have been submitted, when I get a response to my message, or the school contacts me.

Final update: My professor finally responded. He is ""frighteningly ill"" and was locked out of his iPhone. I think he forgot his password to Canvas, which was more than likely stored in his phone.

I have a professor who teaches   classes back to back that are required for my minor. I just took the first this past semester and I’m about to take the second this upcoming semester. The class is small ( ish people) and all but   people who took the class last semester are taking the one next semester. 

The professor has zero work-life balance and struggles staying professional both in and out of the classroom. She’s also not from the country I go to school in, and usually she falls on that excuse when someone criticizes her behavior.

My issue:

On the first day of class, she made us sign up for a texting app, Pronto in order to communicate with us outside of class instead of using email. She has completely abused the this app, demanding near constant communication from me and my classmates. She would often text us at (or even after)  pm asking us to watch  + minute long videos and send paragraphs on what we thought of them. If we don’t respond by our  am class she would deduct points and yell at everyone, including the people who did do it. 

I was trying to keep my head down and just suffer through the class because she is the only professor that teaches it and I need the credits for my minor. I don’t think I can just do that anymore. 

Today she sent us an assignment that will take minimum of   hours and demanded we have it done by next week. The semester doesn’t start until  .  weeks from now. I refuse to do an assignment during my break for a class I’m not even in yet, and I’m not sure how much patience I have for this behavior next semester. 

Several classmates of mine, including myself, are planning to write a formal complaint to the department. I’m pretty sure we have a leg to stand on, but I just wanted to double check with yall before I attach my name on this email. 

Thus, given this information, do we have the right to complain? 

If yall have any other advice, I am happy to listen too! Thank you for reading all this.

UPDATE:

I’ll keep it short and sweet, but basically we tried to work it out with her and she claimed that she had every right to assign work since “its hardly a new class” (????). Anyway, that email got forwarded to the department head and the assignment was promptly shut down. 

Also many of you were right, Pronto is not approved by the school and violates IT stuff. Not sure what they’re gonna do with her, but thank you guys so much for the support and advice!!

Every assignment in every class, when it can, is seriously condescending to young people. 

In my stats class, we had to do these dumb “Academic Habits” assignments once a week, where we watch a video on mental health, social media usage, having a “growth mindset” etc. The main theme overall is “put your phone down and go outside”. Our signature assignment in stats was interpreting   data sets about “social media usage”

In English, I have written   papers that included some sort of social media propaganda. One was a presentation about “teen mental health”, citing social media as a huge factor. The other was about “using social media in a constructive way”. 

What the fuck. College students are adults. Can we stop patronizing them about phones??

1583833164.0,college,"MEGATHREAD: Colleges announcing cancellations due to COVID- **CHANGES**: Due to more and more colleges cancelling, which is good because that was the point of this post, it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep up. Starting now, **I will not add your university unless your comment specifically includes all of the info for me to add, in the format of Name, From, Until, and a source.** Date announced is assumed to be the date you made your post, unless otherwise specified.

Thought it'd be nice to consolidate them somewhere. The below list is fairly close to chronological order. I suspect that the shutdowns announced on Monday have essentially forced a lot of colleges' hands into shutting down: any school that hasn't announced a shutdown by the end of today will just look bad. Here's the list of schools so far that have cancelled classes in some major capacity:

Vacate dorms means the school has asked all students to move out of dorms. Extended means the school had originally announced cancellations, but added more dates or restrictions following it.

1645663649.0,college,"Unpopular opinion: I like online classes more than in-person and I'm gonna tell you whyI have heard a lot of people complain about online classes. They find that they are less motivated to do the work, there isn't much social interaction, and you basically have to teach yourself the subject. 

I hear you. I really do. It can be tough and frustrating at times. Especially when you have a question and instead of just raising your hand or swinging by your professor's office, you have to set up a zoom meeting or wait for an email response that will probably only answer half of your question. 

The thing I like about online classes, however, is that I can: 

* Work more during the hours I would have been stuck in a classroom
* No commuting to and from campus
* I can do the homework at a time that is convenient for me
* I can rewatch lectures if I don't understand it the first time instead of having to scribble notes as fast as I can and....oh he changed the slide before I could finish this chicken-scratch of a diagram that I won't be able to read later anyway. Sad. 
* Not have to put up with the loudmouths or know-it-alls in the classroom
* I can do the work anywhere I want in whatever outfit I want (the pajama game is strong)

For anyone who has issues with procrastinating like I do (literally me writing this post right now instead of doing Spanish homework), I recommend a couple of tricks I picked up after taking  + completely online college classes:

 . Make a schedule and put the due-dates of assignments a couple of days ahead of when they are actually due. This will (hopefully) help with not putting it off until the last minute. I figure that for small assignments, I need at least one day to do a good job and two to three days for bigger assignments. That way I can work on it in little chunks instead of sitting there stressing about a ten-page paper that's due by midnight the day you even think to start working on it. 
 . Work on it in bite-size pieces. Like I said, don't stress yourself out by trying to do everything the day-of. Break the assignment down into manageable chunks and do one part at a time. For a big research paper, for example: Set the due date for four days ahead.

* On **day one**, open the assignment and see what it's asking for. Start by figuring out what you're supposed to be researching. If you get to pick your own topic, spend the day finding something that both meets the papers criteria and that  also interests you. If that's the only thing you get done on day one, that's totally fine. You'll still have three more days to finish it, but at least you're slightly ahead of the game now. 
* **Day two** and **three** should be the actual research and beginning the paper. Try to finish the paper by day three if you can, but it's okay if it doesn't happen. Just try to get close.
* **Day four** is proof-reading and refining before submitting it that night. 

Another piece of advice: Actually email your professor if you get stuck on something. They usually offer online office hours and emails are highly encouraged. I have never had a professor be upset or bothered for me asking a question about something I didn't understand. You aren't bothering them, you aren't stupid for not understanding the material. Just. Email. Them. That's what you're paying them for anyway - to teach you. So let them. 

I could add so much more to this post but I'll leave it at this for now. I hope this eases your fears or unsureness of an online class. They aren't that bad and I actually really like them because of how flexible they are.",3591,662,0

I’ve managed to get all A’s every semester of college up to this point but as you can imagine, this semester was extra hard. I was hanging on to a B in all three classes for basically the entire semester and fighting tooth and nail just to keep it that way.

1656862994.0,college,"Exposing the Disney College Program*if y'all can be so kind to crosspost, we'll get more views on this*

Hi everyone. I recently left my role in the Disney College Program and I thought I would come on here to honestly tell y'all what that experience was like. This is going to be extremely candid, raw and honest. Some of y'all may not like that, and may not like to hear this, but it is all the  % truth and I feel like needs to be told.

 For starters, when we applied, there was no interview, but in order to accept our program we had to pay   dollars. The   dollar charge was required whether we lived at Flamingo Crossings (Disney's housing for CP's) or off property in our own place. We paid   dollars to come work for Disney, which already was odd, but I didn't think much of it at the time. Then, for those living at Flamingo they went over the rent and roommate processes. For rent, it is automatically taken out of your paycheck weekly, meaning you may only have  -  dollars to live on after that. The room layouts come in  x  (  bedrooms   bathrooms),  x  and  x  (  beds in a room with one bathroom per each room). They tell us that we have the option to pick if we want our rooms to be gender neutral or not, and that we have the option to link with one roommate with the exact same start and end dates. What they did *not* tell us is that if you don't link with someone and pick gender neutral they will often throw you with anyone. There was a case where an   year old girl got put into a  x  with an older gentleman, as you can finish college at any age. You don't get told who your actual roommate is until  . You arrive there on your check in date and  . You sign your lease. Even if you link with someone, they don't bother to tell you that you may still not get out with them. So if you're in a  x , you may each get put with the other roommate. For many people who have called Flamingo asking them about roommate issues, or their potentially unsafe matches, the response they have been met with is ""We cannot guarantee your safety"". 

Then there was disability accomodations. My friend, who ended up being my roommate, has celiacs disease. When she went to get an accomodation for her program they connected her with a case advocate who worked to help her get a role that was safe for her. For any of y'all that don't know, celiacs disease makes it so you have a serious autoimmune reaction to gluten, even if it's just simply inhaling particles of it in the air, and it can put you out for weeks or send you to the hospital. Well so she told them her main accommodation she needed was a role that wasn't food and beverage. So where did they put her? Food and beverage. Then she had to fight tooth and nail to get them to change that. Mind the fact this was *before* we even started working. 

Now let's jump to working and arriving. After you move into housing, you are required to go to Traditions, which is the start of your program. At Traditions our speaker blatantly told us ""There will be days you feel depressed, anxious, and not want to go into work. But you *will* go into work regardless. And you are to always smile. Why? Because the guest doesn't care. The guest doesn't care what you're going through"". After that they sent us to get our ID's made, and to finish our registration process. They had us line up to each be asked individually for our information. One part of that was that they asked up, out loud in front of everyone, what our weight was. As you can imagine that was fun for lots of people. 

Jumping into working: they tell you that you are to have  /  availability. The rule is that they need to give you at least an   hour window between shifts. That's their only rule. So they can schedule as much as humanly possible, for as long as they want as long as they give you   hours between then and your next shift. It is extremely common for CP's to be scheduled upwards of   days in a row with no breaks, and shifts up to and often times over   hours. One of my friends got scheduled   days in a row, with almost every day being a   hour shift out in the blazing Florida sun, and one of the days even was a   hour shift. One of my other close friends went into their leader to tell them how exhausted they were with their program and how they felt they needed a break, and that their mental health was declining and their leader responded ""you came here to work, so get back out there and work"". She has type   diabetes and when her number got super low one day she told her leaders she needed an Early Release because she didn't feel good, to which they told her ""The only way we will let you go home is if you are passed out on the ground or need an ambulance"". Now I will say, not every leader is like this, as with anything in life there are good leaders and bad leaders, but sadly this experience with leaders being like this was all too common to hear about at Disney. It also wasn't uncommon to be force extended. At my location we had a huge amount of people one night get force extended, and some of them got put on shifts up to   hours. Which in Florida this all surprisingly is legal.

Throughout the program, you learn very quickly that people start self-terming (quitting) left and right. Tons of people came to the program thinking it would help their depression and anxiety because Disney is their happy place, only to have their conditions seriously worsened and have to leave. The vast majority of CP's you talk to will tell you that they hated working at Disney. Some will tell you they liked it, but also hated and noticed all the aforementioned issues. I fell in the middle, as I did love assisting guests, and my coworkers, but that was the only thing holding me on. Disney also gave us a self admission pass, stating that our one benefit of the program was getting into the parks for free. Well that would've been great if we weren't pretty much blocked out from the parks all the time, and we're given the time between shifts to even go. The vast majority of the time we wanted to go to the parks, it was fully blocked out meaning it was unavailable to even go. We were allowed to put in ADO, meaning approved days off, on our HUB to state that we needed specific days off in the future. If we got our ADO approved it meant no matter what we were to not be scheduled. Well I once got my ADO's approved for a week,   months in advance, where relatives were coming down including my   year old grandma. Only about a week or so before those dates they decided ""nope, we take it back"" and scheduled me anyways, so I had to fight to get at least a few of those days off and then call out the other days which put points on my record. 

For me, due to operational need in the middle of my program they told me my role was being switched. I didn't mind this too much, but then they put me in a role that my disability accomodations didn't allow for. So going to work each day in food and beverage caused me to have allergic reactions  each day. After a week of that I advocated and said I cannot go back into this location, it's too dangerous for me, and that I need my role switched. The leave administration team told me that if I brought in a doctor's note saying I needed a certain amount of days off, that they would honor those days off until I got my role changed and that the points wouldn't go on my record. So I sent in a doctor's note, and they told me I had those days approved and they would tell my leaders and get me in contact with my case advocate so we can do a role change. Seven days into that I get a call from my internship coordinator telling me that they told me false information and that every day I've been out, points are going on my account and that if I don't go back into work soon I would be fired. So I hustled to get in contact with my case advocate and rush to get my role changed, and after   weeks they finally got things changed. They told me they would go on and contact my leaders to get the points removed from my account, because a certain amount of points means you're fired, regardless if it's your fault or not. Did they get those points taken off? Nope, instead my case advocated actually ghosted me. My friend had the same case advocate and he ghosted them too.   months later and still no points had been taken off and I had gotten reprimands for something that wasn't my fault. 

Jumping forward, after a while in my new role, which I actually did enjoy at times because of my coworkers, I decided that the pros of this definitely did not outweigh the cons and I decided to self term. Since leaving the program, my mental health has gotten exponentially better, I have time to actually enjoy Florida and do things that I am passionate about. Not everything in the program was bad, I had some leaders I personally really liked, my coworkers have become some of my best friends, and I got the experience of being able to truly see what I do and don't want for myself. I am greatful that I did the program because it taught me to advocate for myself and it also made me realize my self worth and what I do not need to put up with. It also gave me an opportunity to move to Florida, where I will be staying from now on. I choose to have a healthy relationship with Disney now and have decided for me, Disney is only for visiting, not for working and I don't want to mesh those two things in my mind anymore.

Like oh let's go to this place it has great deals, or how they can't go out or do this activity because they're broke, or how this restaurant is too expensive for them, etc. when it's just $  for a meal plus tip.


Then during Spring break or, because I graduated recently, after graduation, literally all these people are traveling the world. One guy I know like this visited   countries in   continents. Another group of girls did a trip to   European countries. Some other person I know went to visit big US cities. Like, damn, I thought we were both sort of in the same boat but I guess you come from money? Unless it's your parents financing these trips to France or Singapore with your friends.


Unless I'm tripping or something. For the record, my background is ""never going on a plane unless it's visiting my family in Asia every  -  years."" And I already know how much that costs. I didn't come from much money at all, but in college I got some internships that paid $ /hr and then $ /hr. So these same people acting like I'm rich now are traveling the world with their friends or family and that's not something I could even imagine.

Hell, one girl I know straight up said she couldn't afford to buy lunch outside of her meal plan bc her bank account legit had only $ . Then next week she comes with her newest phone and the week after she's ubering to parties. All daddy's money (unironically btw, I asked her and she said her dad just venmoed her like a grand for the week) but it's so weird to me.


Is it just me or is stuff like this common as hell? And for the record, I go to a state school. None of these are international students. They're typically not cosplaying being poor.


Edit: Lots of people are focusing on the $  + tip point which is a really not the main point at all. I mentioned that because for me personally that's a lot (I think $  or less is fine and anything more usually hurts to buy) but $  + tip is good for like a once-in-awhile thing. And the people I'm mentioning eat out way more than me. It's not like I'm carelessly going out for expensive meals.

I am currently doing a master's. High school and university as a whole has been fucking hell for me, I hate studying, I hate the ridiculous demands asked from students, especially during this damn pandemic, everything is fucking shit and teachers only keep demanding more and more. Students are having fucking mental breakdowns and reaching burnout all over the place, and everyone talks about it as if it's just a quirky side effect of going to college. WTF.

My previous uni literally set up a ""crying chamber"" to ""let out all the stress"" so ""you can go back to studying with a clear head again"". Like, that is the most dystopian, ignorant bullshit I've heard in my entire life. How about fixing your messed up system? How about not driving students to the point of insanity in the first place?

I've been pushing myself through this, and I don't exaggerate this: HELL, just so I could live comfortably. Get more job opportunities, with hopefully better pay, so I can live a comfortable life. But I feel like I've reached my absolute limit. Teachers and other try-hard students alike expect us to study, seek internships, seek extracurricular activities, etc.   fucking  .

Basically, a whole load of STEM. Which I chose because I find it vastly interesting. But yeah, quite the switch in work ethic as I've noticed.

I also see a lot of references to ""American work culture"", which I find funny because I'm currently studying in the Netherlands and have never been outside of Europe. But I'm not surprised this stuff is a global problem (hence the tag).

If you need a refresher (and oh my god some of you really do):

""Liberal arts"" refers to degrees focusing in the humanities, mathematics, and social & physical sciences. A ""Liberal arts college"" is a college specializing in undergraduate degrees in these subjects. 

No, a university that *has* these degrees does not necessarily make it ""liberal arts."" 

No, ""the arts"" are not the same thing. The arts can refer to a lot of things, but in general it just means creative means of expression, both fine arts and in things such as film, theater, and literature. 

""Liberal Arts Education"" *can* refer to the general education system in some instances. In general it's a similar concept to a ""liberal arts college,"" but context is very necessary here.

No, ""Liberal arts"" has nothing to do with the political ""liberal."" Liberal arts in this instance is derived from the latin *Liberalis ars* which generally means ""free art / practice.""

TL;DR: Social science, physical science, philosophy, math, and literature. Sometimes it means ""general education."" No, it's not political. You can be conservative and have a liberal arts degree.

edit: also If you got a  -year public university in the US (unsure about other countries) it almost guaranteed that it contains a liberal arts college (or multiple)

1637259641.0,college,"Calculus Professor just assigned   hours of lecture, and   quizzes over Thanksgiving break… Please help.I wish I was making this up… 

I’m a Freshman in Calc   and due to my professor rambling on and on in class about useless stories, and his “incredible math skills” he’s super behind on content. So naturally, he had the genius idea of assigning   chapters over break, each chapter containing    -minute lecture videos, accompanied by a   minute timed quiz for each video. He’s just using his old lecture videos to assign to us. 

We got assigned these today, (the day before our break) and they are due November  th (the day we get back) So he’s basically forcing us to teach ourselves the content and spend an ungodly amount of time studying during break. To make matters worse, the exam on these   chapters is also the day we get back from break.

So I’m wondering, is it normal in college for professors to assign this much work during break??? Anyone with similar experiences? And any advice on how to get all of it done? At this point, I’m so stressed out and now I won’t even have a Thanksgiving break. Thanks Professor!


Update: 

Wow, I didn’t expect to be given so much good advice! Thank you all for your concerns and great advice regarding my issue at hand. 

I ended up emailing my professor in order to clarify his work expectations for us over break, and he ended up telling me that there will be only    -minute quizzes, not   as he originally stated. That makes more sense due to my calculations of   chapters, each with   videos and a quiz after each video.

It makes me feel a bit better about the situation, but it’s still a lot of work to be done, and quite frankly, pretty shitty of him to assign over break. As stated above, he is the type of professor that has a very difficult time actually teaching the course, and as a result, gets very distracted, goes on half-hour tangents, and brags about his degree. He also expects us students to often know much more than we actually do, so he gets frustrated when we ask questions. 

If I can take anything positive from this experience, it is that I will finally be able to learn Calculus   in an uninterrupted way. I will be free of his useless tangents and stories, so I can hopefully better prepare for the exam this way, as opposed to his “teaching strategy.”

1609694665.0,college,"You pay for college, you should know how it operates.I’m gonna lead off the bat by saying this can be a long post. As someone that works professionally in Higher ed, and as someone who got their masters in student affairs and higher ed have a pretty strong understanding of how universities operate at their core. For you students out there, my plan is to lay a pretty decent foundation here to help you understand many different aspects of how your university probably operates, since you pay for it and are the reason these institutions exist. I’ll say, I’m not the expert on everything or every type of university, and my experience is entirely in the United States so that is who this will be most relevant to, but I’m hoping I can bring some interesting info to you on this Sunday morning! 

First and foremost, universities are businesses at the core. Just like Target, Walmart, or Amazon, they have a bottom line that needs to be met. Your tuition and student fees pay this bottom line, alongside federal and state funding if your institution is public. The more students a university has, the better faculty they can hire, the more research they can pump out, the better alumni they can get who will hopefully donate, and the cycle continues. Your money is being put into a long term investment by the university to sustain itself. The biggest expenditure of any university? Faculty and staff. Let’s break those down. 

Faculty are your professors and researchers who teach courses, contribute to scientific papers, and experts of a given field. Thing is, any bit of discovery or research faculty yield, their intellectual property in other words, belongs to the university. If I were a cancer researcher and made a massive breakthrough in cancer treatment, that belongs to my employer, not me. This is not an exclusive practice to higher ed, but consider how faculty are paid and tenured up front and how it is part of a larger system for an institution to protect their investments. 

Staff are everyone else. These are your custodial staff, dining staff, residence hall employees, student activities peeps, diversity center staff, etc. If the faculty are left brain, staff are right brain. Their job is to keep amenities usable, create safe environments for all on campus, and create learning/social opportunities outside of the lecture hall. I fall into this category. 

Let’s stick with this left brain and right brain analogy. Left brain are your academic affairs team, they are focused on the classroom experience and your enrichment in the field you have specified. Your advisors, faculty and program chairs are gonna work to develop your academic capital.  Your right brain, student affairs, will work to adjust you to being a strong functioning member of a global society, helping you network and meet people you would never normally meet. They’re focused on your social capital. These two parts of the brain are meant to work in tandem, but at many universities they grind up against each other. Some in student affairs view those in academic affairs as pretentious or uncaring. Some in academic affairs see those in student affairs as wasteful or unnecessary. I’m not here to say who is right or wrong, but instead advocate that they need to work together to create the best experience for all. 

Let’s talk about how your money breaks down further: your fees pay for all the above staff and faculty, as well as dining halls, programs on campus, sports and clubs. Sports are seen as big money makers on campus: this isn’t always true! Sure, some very large programs (think Alabama or UT Austin) turn a profit on their sports programs, and usually the profit from these programs go into paying for other sports on campus. Usually though, sports programs break even on their costs or even subsidize the costs across the whole student body. Sports have become their own worst enemy: they need to fill seats and charge fees to sustain themselves lest they fall apart. 

Another important thing to know about your money: it doesn’t always pay for what you think it does. Some departments or offices on campus are auxiliary services. What that means is that they do NOT receive federal funding. Housing is a great example of this. All money that housing uses is *usually* only what is earned by students living in the halls. So your money goes into paying for the maintenance of all buildings, housing staff, programming etc. Parking is another auxiliary service. This is not to defend they high prices of living on campus, but instead to help explain why some of those costs are the way they are. 

One last thing I’ll cover here is power. The head of your university may be titled President, Chancellor, Dean etc. You may believe this person holds all the power on campus: this isn’t necessarily true. Most heads of universities are tasked with two big things: build strong alumni relationships to get more funds, and build strong political connections on behalf of the university. These presidents or chancellors are truly political figures at the core and they have lots of different people in their ears telling them what to do: student governments, faculty and staff associations, alumni, parents, and the biggest of all, board of regents/directors. This board is where lots of power rests. I’d recommend you learn who is on your board and what their backgrounds are: this can help you understand a lot of decisions made on your campus. Ultimately though, the power is in the consumer, and that is the student body. The ability to make changes as students cannot be understated. 


Whew. That is a lot. And it doesn’t even scratch the surface of all that is there. I’m hoping that this helps provide some interesting information of how funds are allocated, how systems operate, and where the power rests in any given institution. As a student who is paying to uphold all these different things, I believe it is your responsibility to know how your money is spent and how you are being advocated for on multiple levels. My career is in supporting students through their higher ed journey and I love it to death. Because I love it so much, I really believe that it is my duty to be honest and transparent with those who pay my salary. Hopefully y’all enjoyed this and finds use in it!",6302,1080,0

The uni I'm at has a decent amount of dorm options, but I really wanted to go with the one in the center of campus, which was in high demand due to the location. On room selection day I was lucky enough to get one of the very last rooms available at my desired residence hall. I was matched with a random roommate and thought everything good to go until they messaged me the next day telling me to switch out because the spot in his dorm was meant for his friend.

By now, there are no other rooms available in that residence hall since it was in such high demand, meaning that if I gave up the spot I would have to go to one of the dorms at the edge of campus. I was really looking forward to living in my selected dorm because it's really close to all my classes and I'm almost fully legally blind, meaning biking / driving / skating around isn't an option for me and walking was a super convenient option from where I was (planning on) living. 

Now, though, it seems that I've been given the ultimatum of either being forced to move out to another dorm or live with someone who does not want to live with me. On the housing application sheet, there was a section meant to indicate whether or not you were planning on living with a selected roommate or a random roommate, and this person says something went wrong with their friend's application which is why they weren't automatically paired.

All I want to say is, thanks. I understand college is hard. It was for me at times. Very much so. I’ve been through the mental health ringer, health events, family crises, and had it derail school. I failed classes, hit academic probation, but eventually bounced back and am now a professor. 

It’s not perfect, but I do encourage you to reach out to your profs when things go south. Some are more receptive than others. I generally accommodate these things. The counseling/mental health centers and academic advisers can sometimes be helpful advocates too. The earlier you reach out the better. 

Also, if you have ideas, let me know what we can do better. I hate knowing students are flying under the radar with this, when I’m more than willing to help.",1239,225,0

1589996198.0,college,"Tips on how to raise your GPA as an average studentI technically made the dean's list this semester with a GPA of  . . I know for some it may not too high, but as someone who made a post at the end of last semester how to increase my pithy GPA of  . , it has been a good reminder that grades are not an accurate reflection of your self-worth.

This sub has helped me in the past, so I decided to make a post giving some personal suggestions and reflecting on some of the study habits that I adopted this semester.

&#x B;

 . ***Make a planner or calendar*** with all the due dates from the syllabus. Update this as changes arise. I also make a breakdown of grades for each course.
 . ***Grind to score well in your first midterm or major assignments.*** They cover the basic topics in the course that later material builds on. My personal opinion is that it sets the expectations for both how you and the professor believe you are going to perform in the course. Furthermore, they are usually comparatively easier & therefore important for courses in which you can only drop  - % points to score an A.
 . Be that kid that ***speaks up in class***. Clearing up doubts as they arise is very important. You will not remember to look it up later. This will help the professor remember who you are (hint: professors like students that are interested in what they teach!)
 . ***Do the readings when they are assigned.***
 . ***Review what you do after each class***. Summarise by writing down notes or typing out the important points that you have learned in class (each time) using your own notes, lecture slides, book, handouts, and readings.
 . ***Go to*** ***office hours,*** and not just before the exams. Office hours are for you to make use of. Ask your silly questions (if you still too shy to ask in a lecture setting) or ask for clarification on what the assignments are. Very important as soon as you feel like you are struggling. t is as simple as saying, that you feel like you are struggling or not doing well you had hoped.
 . ***Exploit the rubric***. For a majority of the assignments professors layout word-to-word an outline of what they expect from you in the rubric. Follow it!!

I am not going to lie it is a lot of hard work (especially with the fun new challenge of COVID-  this semester) but just remember most college courses (at least at the undergraduate level) are designed so that the average student can succeed.",2438,445,0

I've ran out of a room crying once when everyone looked at me to answer a question in class.
I wanted to change this about myself, so I went into college as a Communication major, marketing minor, joined a marketing club (now on the executive board), and got a job in hospitality and another job in sales. 

I have gotten a lot better EXCEPT for standing in front of an entire room of people looking at me while it's dead silent. Couple examples:

 . Gave a speech about boba tea in front of a class of about   students (could've been worse). Rambled for about   minutes about how a lot of people don't like it because of the sucking balls into your mouth part and the texture. Yea

 . Dad jokes. I wear glasses so I walked into a room to give a pitch and I said ""You know the great thing about being blind as a bat and having social anxiety? I can take my glasses off and it's like none of you are here"" and I took off my glasses and put them on the table and proceeded with my pitch.

It is now very much the norm for students to bring their laptops to class to take notes. I am fine with that and allow it as do a vast majority of my colleagues. But please know that it is very obvious to your instructor when you are doing something other than taking notes. You might be online, messaging a friend, playing a game, or doing whatever one might do with an open laptop; we know. You might ask 'how do you know?' There are many signs. Maybe I am not talking for a minute while a student speaks but you are frantically typing away. Maybe I am discussing something rather mundane and you keep looking at your laptop and smiling. Maybe I cold call on you and you have no idea what we are discussing. Maybe it is because you have not looked up from your screen for   straight minutes.

It is possible that you do not care that we know but you should. Because when you bomb an assignment and come running to me for leniency I will remember. When you email me asking for clarification on something I discussed at length while you were distracted I'll have to decide how quickly to respond to that email. I'm not a dick, I am very student-centered but respect is a two way street and if you show me none I am hard pressed to want to show you any.

1608677416.0,college,"In the CARES Act, colleges and universities received $  Billion in Covid-  Aid. In this second stimulus package, they're receiving $  billion. My question is: where is that money going to end up?After doing some research, it seems that the $  billion, similar to the $  billion, is being earmarked for the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF). But, does anyone know how these funds will be used exactly, and will it be similar to the March relief?

**EDIT:**

I think I found the allocation scheme. It's starts on line   on page   of the bill which is titled ""HIGHER  EDUCATION  EMERGENCY  RELIEF  FUND""

Specifically on line   of page  , it states how the universities may use the funds allocated to them.

Here is the excerpt:

**USES  OF FUNDS —An  institution  of  higher  education  receiving  funds  under  this  section  may  use  the  funds received to**

>**( )  defray  expenses  associated  with  coronavirus (including  lost  revenue,  reimbursement  for  expenses already  incurred,  technology  costs  associated  with  a transition  to  distance  education,  faculty  and  staff  trainings, and payroll);**  
>  
>**( )  carry  out  student  support  activities  authorized   by   the   HEA   that   address   needs   related   to   coronavirus;**  
>  
>**( )  provide  financial  aid  grants  to  students  (including  students  exclusively  enrolled  in  distance  education), which may be used for any component of the student’s  cost  of  attendance  or  for  emergency  costs that  arise  due  to  coronavirus,  such  as  tuition,  food,  housing,  health  care  (including  mental  health  care),  or  child  care.  In  making  financial  aid  grants  to  students,   an   institution   of   higher   education   shall   prioritize  grants  to  students  with  exceptional  need, such as students who receive Pell Grants.**

EDIT  :

I think I found the provision that dictates the amount higher institutions are required to give as financial aid to students.  It's starts on line   of page  . It states the following:

>**( )  Institutions  of  higher  education  receiving  allocations  under   section   (a)( )  of  this  title  shall  provide  at  least  the   same  amount  of  funding  in  emergency  financial  aid  grants  to   students  as  was  required  to  be  provided  under  sections    (a)( )  and (c) of division B of the CARES Act (Public Law   – ).**  An  institution  of  higher  education  that  repurposes  funds  pursuant  to  paragraph  ( )  **shall  ensure  that  not  less  than     percent  of  the  funds  received under section  (a)( ) of division B of the CARES  Act  (Public  Law   – )  are  used  for  financial  aid  grants  to  students**  under  either  section   (c)  of  division  B  of  the  CARES  Act  or  section   (c)( )  of  this  title,  or  a  combination  of  those  sections:

&#x B;

So, it seems that the students that received payments in March from their university will also be receiving it this time around, as well. However, I'm not sure if more students are going to be included in these payments. Given that there's going to be almost $  Billion dollars more in funding this time, it would only make sense that either more students receive money or the students that received money last time will get more, but nothing has made sense this year, so I wouldn't bet on this making sense either.

I may be missing something here, so if one of y'all find better info, please don't hesitate to correct me. It'll help all of us get a better picture of what's going on.

Most schools have formal review surveys called “Professor Evaluations” that they ask folks to do at the mid term and the end of the semester.

“I’m (engineering/pre-med/etc) so I’m taking a lot of science and math classes you don’t have to take.” (Good for you, I guess? I don’t really believe that more difficult classes make a major superior to others, so I guess I just don’t really get the point to this one)

“Do you ever feel like you’re selling yourself short?” (No.)

“Wouldn’t you rather be a child psychologist/social worker/lawyer?” (I think for some reason the fact that I’m *not* jumping straight from undergrad to grad school makes a lot of people uncomfortable. That’s really not my problem, sorry)

What to do when your professor asks questions on quizzes and exams that they never went over in lecture? 

This is an ongoing thing with all of her exams and quizzes, and she offers no extra credit for the class. 

Example: we learned in class that cooking cast iron increases iron absorption.

On the quiz: what increases iron absorption? 

The answer: cooking in cast iron and using acidic sauces.

Not once did she mention acidic sauces in class and there is no way this is a critical thinking Q with what she’s taught. 

This isn’t the only example I have but she locks the exams so I can’t go look back at the specific questions. I am trying to remember the Q better now that I know she has answers she never taught. 

Another ex of how she asks questions: infants need   essential amino acids, adults need    (learned in lecture)

Question: how many amino acids do adults and infants need? (I remember this Q specifically bc I had to think it through)

I answered  , she said the answer was  (when I asked what I got wrong). I feel like this was a trick question?? Because both need  , not  . 

I emailed her about it and she didn’t respond. I looked up her rate my professor and this is a common theme in this class and her more advanced class too (I will be paying $$$ to take the class anywhere else than with her next semester). She asks things she never discussed in lecture and sometimes the questions/answers are wrong. 

With the recent Q on cast iron, I asked for credit for the answer I gave because she never went over acidic sauces in class. 

Exact message: “Cooking with acidic sauces was not taught in class lecture and there is no mention of it in the notes. Is there a way I could please receive credit for this question? I went back and re-watched the lectures as well as looking through my notes thoroughly and there is no mention of cooking with acidic sauces. Using cast iron is the only thing you taught us so there is no way I knew that. Thank you, name”

Clothes:
- only bring clothes that are appropriate for the climate and season where your school is. Think to yourself, “will I realistically need this clothing item between now and the next time I come home?” If not, don’t bring it. 

- only bring two week’s worth of clothes. This will keep clothing clutter to a minimum and motivate you to do laundry regularly so you don’t have dirty clothes everywhere. 

- Most of your clothes should be casual and comfortable, but you should have one “going out” outfit (you shouldn’t be going to parties this semester, but you might want to dress up if you have a date or something) and at least one professional-looking outfit for if you have a job interview or presentation. 

- maximum   pairs of shoes. Any more than that will be difficult to find space for in your little dorm closet, and will take up a ton of space in your luggage. You will be walking around a lot more than you did in high school, so plan your shoe choices accordingly. Function over fashion. 

Decor:

- This semester I’m actually not bringing any decor at all. I know it sounds depressing, but a lack of decor will make it much easier to pack everything up if I end up having to leave. Under normal circumstances, though, I recommend photos, posters, and string lights or garlands. 

- DO NOT BRING ANYTHING that takes up space on a horizontal surface. Your desk is small, and you will need it for your school supplies, papers, and as a space for eating and/or doing makeup. You will regret bringing anything non-functional that takes up space on your desk or other flat surface. If you want to decorate, use your walls!

- I wouldn’t recommend bringing a tapestry. My roommate had two of them and they were constantly falling down because dorm-friendly wall adhesives (i.e. adhesives that won’t damage the wall) aren’t strong enough for tapestries. 

- Some dorms have really crappy lighting. In my first dorm, the light was so dim it was essentially useless. I ended up buying an LED floor lamp to solve this problem. If you don’t know what the lighting will be like, wait until after you move in and then buy a floor lamp from a local store if it ends up being necessary. 

- If you ever do makeup, bring a desktop mirror so you can do your makeup at your desk. Your roommates/floormates might get annoyed if you’re constantly using the bathroom sink mirror for applying makeup. 

Other things:

- Don’t bring too many dishes. One or two of each item is good. Plus, some items can serve double-duty! For example, I didn’t have a bowl and whenever I wanted soup or something, I ate out of my coffee mug. Make sure to bring dish soap, a sponge, and a dish towel so you can wash your dishes in the sink. Your dorm probably won’t have a dishwasher. 

- Only bring the hair care stuff you actually use. My mom told me to bring a hairdryer, but I hate blow-drying my hair, so that hairdryer was a total waste of space. You know yourself best. Bring the stuff you know you will use, leave behind the stuff you probably won’t use. The same applies for makeup and jewelry. 

- Bring cleaning supplies to keep your room hygienic. If you have a bathroom in your dorm room, you and your roommate(s) will be responsible for cleaning it, so bring bathroom cleaning supplies. If you have a communal bathroom though, you will not be responsible for cleaning it. 

- For school supplies, bring the stuff that works best for you. If you prefer using pens instead of pencils for note-taking, bring lots of pens and only a couple pencils. If you love organizing with folders but you hate  -ring binders, don’t bring binders. You are the boss of your organization system in college. There is no school supply list. Pick the supplies that have previously worked well for you, and leave the ones you’ve always hated behind. 

- Even after using these less-is-more tricks, you might still feel like you have too much stuff. At that point, you probably don’t have too much stuff. 

Hope this helps! Feel free to add your own tips in the comments.

Edit: One last thing... if you end up needing something that you didn’t bring, you can pick it up from home on your next trip back or order it online. Sometimes it’s actually better to underpack than to overpack. You might be surprised how much you don’t actually need.",4898,877,0

1595878735.0,college,"UPDATE: Prof has COVID and disappeared after the first week of class...Some of you asked so here it is .... the big update!

First - if you end up in a situation as I did in my [original post]( this may be helpful info. Maybe not. 

So my professor ended up contracting COVID-  and disappeared. With about   weeks left in our accelerated  -week summer course, Prof slowly started coming back online. We ended up dropping a lot of labs and quizzes altogether from the syllabus and focused on the important shit. Also, prof made it clear he would be generous with grades since we were left to our own defenses to learn   chapters. We wrapped up on time and I got a solid A so I was happy to just wait for the prof to come back in the end. However, I did not learn what I would have had we had a normal class and so that is a little concerning. I am following up with the second part of this subject in the fall ( I took class A  and now need to take class A ) so I may struggle but only time will tell. Prof did video lectures remainder of class - even being clearly sick he made a solid effort, and I really appreciate that. I thought he was strange for using a cell phone but turns out he was teaching from a hospital while in isolation - which is crazy and I have no idea how Prof did that but they did. 

So here is my advice to any student who ends up in a similar situation. First, start reading the textbook and plan on teaching yourself - while making sure to follow the schedule unless it changes. Message your classmates (even if its  % online and you don't know them personally), because odds are they have the same questions and will respond to you asap). If you get to the point where you haven't heard anything in over a week first email the Prof, then if no response then email your advisement consular who can help too. If all fails come back here and let us know because we have a LOT of awesome people in this sub that have really good advice. 

Life happens. Stay committed and on task. and this too shall pass.

No one dares to admit it, but college students are awful about abandoning animals. Many students graduate and move to new places that don't take animals so they ""just so happen"" to lose their animals and leave their cats and dogs behind as strays, especially cats.

If you live in your college town during the summer, you may notice that many stray cats pop up immediately after graduation or when leases tend to end. It's also seen somewhat in the shelters, too. 

Don't be an asshole. Animals are not a toy. If you adopt one, either keep it or hand it off to another responsible owner, but for the love of all things, don't just toss it on the street.",753,134,0

I just took a final in a class that up to the final I was near the top of the class of, I was one of the only students that could answer questions the professor asked and did significantly better on open-ended quizzes. It's a very difficult class so I spent over   days and probably  -  hours studying for the final, reading the textbook, memorizing vocab, etc. Also for context, this class is a lecture class with hundreds of students.

The day of the final came and on the multiple choice section I got a  / , so a  %. I thought that the exam was really difficult, and while I figured I did worse than the average student, I thought the average would be pretty low, but over  % of the class had a perfect score on the test, and  % had it right within   point of perfect. I am assuming that a test bank for the exam was leaked, especially since over half the class finished the exam in under   minutes.

Am I right to assume that people cheated on this exam? And how do I recover from this to focus on the rest of my finals?

1565663878.0,college,"Dear Incoming Freshmen,As the summer is winding down and you are getting ready to leave home and go off to your college of choice (if you haven’t already), this post is for you. 

Leaving for college is both a liberating and terrifying experience. You leave everything that you’ve ever known to go to this place to peruse a better life for yourself. While there is much honor in doing this, there is no doubt that you feel scared to leave the comfort of your parents home and the life that you have become accustomed to. You will be leaving your parents and your home (for those of you not commuting), your friends, your pets, your room, etc. You go to this new place with no idea what to expect and not knowing many people. Many college students have gone through this. 

As a sophomore, I will admit that I do not know everything that there is to no know about going away to college. However, I can say that I can offer pieces of advice. 

Going away to college is a big deal. It is a major transitional period in your life. Your parents know this, your professors know this. That being said, in your freshman year, professors and school officials do tend to be more lenient toward freshman because they are adjusting to the new lifestyle of living away from home and on their own. 

Once you move in to your new dorm, the reality of the situation will not begin to set in until your parents leave (If they helped you move in. I know that some kids drive themselves). Once they leave, take some time to unpack and organize your things. Then maybe take a walk around campus, either by yourself or with a roommate, to familiarize yourself with your surroundings and the layout of the campus. 

Don’t try to join too many clubs or organizations because if you do what I did, you try to sign up for as many things as possible. Please take into consideration that you are acclimating to this new lifestyle and don’t try to overwhelm yourself with unnecessary activities. You also need to make time to do everything, such as study and do your laundry. More power to those that can handle it all though.

Remember to be respectful of your roommate. You will share a room and maybe a bathroom with this person for the whole year. It is better to be at a good understanding of each other’s boundaries then to deal with the fallout from not doing so later. Also remember to set up those boundaries earlier. Your RAs will most likely encourage this. An RA told me something that I will never forget and its that you will not always be best friends with your roommate, sometimes you are just simply that; roommates. 

Keep your classes and classwork organized. You will save so much time not having to dig through piles of paper to find one assignment. Personally, I use separate binders for each class but that’s just me. 

Figure out a good sleep schedule that works for you and stick to it. Don’t wake up at staggered times and go to bed at staggered times. There were countless times that I would have an  pm class as my first one that day and sleep until  :  and then not want to go to bed until   or   the following night before I had an  am the next day. Sleep is more important than you think.

Always print things out in advance. You don’t want printer problems to screw you over   minutes before you have to turn it in. Print it out ASAP to save yourself some stress. 

Never feel pressured into partying. If you want to go to a party, then by all means go. If it is not your thing, then don’t go. Just make sure that it will not be an inconvenience to your schoolwork. It is okay to say no to going to a party. I know many, many people that made partying their first priority and they dropped out by the start of the second semester. It’s important to have a good balance between fun and work. 

Go to class!! Just go. You don’t want to miss one and be out of the loop and have no idea what’s going on. If you have to miss one because you are sick or there are family issues going on, email your teacher or ask classmates to catch you up, maybe even bring you a copy of class work. You have unlimited resources to keep you caught up. 

In regard to the above paragraph, you are allotted a certain amount of classes that you can miss before you fail. Do not abuse these because I guarantee you that there will come a day where you really wish that you had a freebie to use but you used them all in the first two months. Just keep a couple in the reserves and use them wisely. 

And last but not least, do what YOU want to do. Do what makes YOU happy and what you feel is best for yourself. Don’t do things you don’t want to do because your friends are doing them. Don’t do something that you don’t want to do because your parents are forcing you to. Do what makes YOU happy. And while you may feel pressured from all sides to do things that don’t make you happy, in the end is that really a way to live your life? Constantly bending over backwards for something you don’t like? Be yourself. Do what you love. Be happy. College only lasts for so long so enjoy the time that you have there. 

Sincerely, 
Your neighborhood sophomore

Just curious if anyone has experienced anything similar, and if so, what was the outcome (though I hope no one else has been here). 

So, I *graduated* in spring. I was accepted to a grad program, moved across the country, and have been taking GRAD classes/working/conducting research all summer. 

I received an email this afternoon from my UG uni stating that I could apply for readmission and graduation, if I wanted to graduate in December. 

Say what?! 

It turns out, I had an incomplete (thanks to Covid) THAT WAS NEVER CHANGED. Mind you, this was a research course that was an elective (didn’t need it to graduate). The instructor turned in the grade after the deadline. 

Again, say what?!

Before finding out that a degree wasn’t granted, I contacted the uni asking why I haven’t received my diploma yet. They mentioned they were backordered and I wouldn’t receive until the end of summer. NEVER did anyone mention that I wouldn’t be awarded a degree.  

It’s likely my grad school won’t mind at all, and I’ll continue on like nothing happened, but my mind is blown right now. And I know the pandemic has really hit academia hard, but shit. Can’t a girl even graduate?! 

TL;DR: Found out I didn’t officially graduate undergraduate despite already being in grad school, thanks to UG uni not submitting paperwork.",1584,266,0

You may remember me from a post from a few months ago, called “my roommate is about to make me fail my exams.”

I realized i forgot to update that post: basically my RA had a talk with us, which pissed my roommate off even MORE, and she started doing more microaggressions towards me. Now she likes to play her shows out loud all night and screams at me when I try to turn the lights off. I invested in a blackout eye mask and ear plugs, which have greatly helped. I was also told nothing much can be done, as she absolutely refuses to move, and I can’t move my stuff to any of the other dorms available, they’re all across campus and no one I know has a car.

I’ve been spending less and less time in the room and for some reason it’s pissing her off so badly. I was gonna just stick it out for the rest of the year, until today, when she locked me out of the room after a shower. I don’t bring my keys to the shower as she’s usually in there with the door unlocked, and I usually bring undergarments and a robe but no towels, as our room is directly across from the bathroom. I don’t think I’ve ever gotten so mad at someone in my life, nor do I think I’ve ever screamed that much in my life. She flat out told me that she hoped I got assaulted so I wouldn’t spend so much time out of the room.

1695888804.0,college,"HELP: My brother deleted four years of workI'm   and in my final quarter of college. About   and a half years ago, I got an iPad to start taking notes. I love it, both for the convenience of carrying one thing and for the organization it gives. A lot of my course material overlaps, so it makes it easier to have the notes in one place. I plan to go to grad school, so it'll be nice to reference them later should I need refreshers.

However, it goes to sh\*t when it comes to my brother. I love him, but he likes to play around on my devices (he has his own device, he just likes to use mine for whatever reason). Usually, he'll just look through photos or play music, but on a few occasions, I've left my iPad with the goodnotes app open. He thinks its a game and will scribble/erase all over them before I get the make a copy. Unfortunately, Goodnotes doesn't have a revision history feature so usually I'll just have to redo everything.

If I get mad or try to explain, it'll stick for a few minutes but it never stays. He's severely autistic, so he genuinely does not know any better. All he understands is that I'm mad at him or that he did something wrong, so he just cries. Then all I can do is hug him, point to the iPad, and shake my head ""No touching."" He'll understand for a minute, but he's incredibly OCD when it comes to his routine. So the next day he'll repeat the cycle, he just goes back to playing with my devices. I've updated his own device to have everything mine does, but he still uses my device.

After he deleted notes the night before a midterm (I went to go get a snack), I broke down. I completely changed the passcode and added a finger ID.

While I was out getting groceries, he security locked the shit. Everything online tells me I need to reset it to factory settings, but I don't know how many notes I've actually saved. So I don't want to reset it and delete everything. Also, it's been a while since I've updated the software so I'm unsure if that's up to date.

I don't know what to do. If there's a way to bypass the security access and open it so I can back it up, please let me know. If not, is there a way where I can make good notes require a PIN code to access it every time I open the app? That way he can still play on it, but my notes will still be safe? Or a way to disable the ""too many attempted failures"" feature?

It's really shitty I got to do this in the first place, but I don't know what else I can do. As much as he drives me up the wall, I still love my brother. So I got to work around it I guess

It’s my first year as an RA and I’ve had trouble with many people in my building but nothing like this night. So to begin the story i had been hanging out on another floor in another RAs room. I’m on duty this night because it’s my usual duty night. So as I’m hanging out with the other RA in their room I hear a loud noice in the hallway and I come out to see what’s going on? As I leave out I see this guy with a whole mattress he had stolen from another room walking down the hallway. When he gets back to his room he slams the door and begins screaming at himself. He’s clearly drunk and can’t comprehend what’s going on. So me and another RA attempt to get him to take the mattress back and and go sleep the alcohol off. Eventually we get him to take the mattress back to the room it came from. Now he’s walking down the hallways trying to hug us to try and I guess make things right. He suddenly spots a random kid on his ways back to his room and attempts to punch him. We stop him and call the cops who come and give him a citation. He’s begging and pleading with the cops asking why this has to happen but the still give him the citation and tell him to go to bed because if they have to come back he’s going to jail. So he goes in his room for   minutes before coming back out and hurling insults at one RA. He then goes back to his room and slams his door so hard the lock breaks. We call the cops again and when they show up he gets tackled and arrested he resist the entire way down to the point where   cops have to take him downstairs and put him in a car where he is taken to spend the night in jail.

My dorm room isn't particularly bad or anything, but no matter what I do it just doesn't feel like home.  A common answer when I looked up this was just to decorate and stuff and even when I do that I still hate it.  Even among posters and lights and rugs, it's still a very very barebones room.

Part of it is definitely that it doesn't really feel like there's a clear separation between school and living.  Like even after all my stuff is done I still live at my college which means it's hard to really feel like I get a break.  Also, the dorms, at least at my uni, are all quite loud and filled with hordes of partying freshmen.  It legitimately feels like I'm living at the zoo with how hectic it is, and compared to off-campus apartments/houses that I've visited, it's way more severe in a dorm.

I also don't really have the ability to cook my own food or even store food that's not candy or bags of chips.  There is the dining hall, obv, but it doesn't really feel the same.

1566577453.0,college,"A Former Student’s Top Tips for CollegeAs a recent graduate and with many people starting college on Monday, I thought I would pass on some tips that helped me throughout my studies. These are some tips I really haven’t seen mentioned before and although some of these tips may not be applicable to everyone, they sure helped me out. 

 . Network as many people as you can to and go out of your way to help people. 

I would say I talked to about  % of the people in my classes (about class size of  ) and got to know about   people from each class really well. When I had a question about homework I always had someone to ask and when people asked me a question I tried my best to answer. I would even used my tablet to make a step by step example to help them understand the topic better. When I graduated I got multiple jobs interviews/offers because people knew the type of person I was and recommended me for the job at the company they worked for. 

 . Talk to your professors and show them what type of student your are. 

Put in the extra effort into studying for your tests and completing your projects. Spend that extra time in creating your presentation and attempting to have the best results for the project possible. Let me tell you professors recognize this and when they need someone to help with their research they may turn to you. I had a couple of professors approach me during my senior year offering me a job working for them along with PAYING FOR MY MASTERS DEGREE. I know this may not be true for some majors but for some it is. 

 . Learn to read PDFs on your computer. 

I didn’t buy a college text book in   of the   years I was in college (sophomore year throughout my masters) because I either found PDFs online or was given them by other students (this is where networking and going out of your way to help others comes back around). The last book I bought was a chemistry book and the only reason I bought that was because I had to have the online access code (such a rip off). Some of the books were the previous edition but the information in them was still  % the same. The only thing that was altered was the example and homework problems. 

 . Make a study guide that summarizes all of the important topics with worked out example problems for every course relative to your major. 

Right before every test I made a short summary guide of every major topic that would be on that test along with a few worked out examples. Many of my courses called for knowledge from a previous course and I used this study guide to quickly/ easily remember those topics. I also used this guide to study for my job interviews. You will be thankful for this when the person interviewing you makes you solve problems on the white board 

 . Find out where your department staff is and always be friendly with them. 

Over the first two years I got to know the office staff of my department and every time they had leftover food from meetings they would let me know. I got a free lunch one to three times a week from this. 


I hope this helps you out some and if you would like me to further explain just let me know!


Edit: Many people are asking me through on and commenting about how to network. I was/am an extremely introverted person that enjoys being alone at times. To show how introverted I am here is a story: I didn’t like talking to people so much that in my first semester I would eat my lunch in my truck. Well one day a guy from my calculus class saw me and came to my truck and started talking to me. The day after he found me again and did the same thing. The third day I park in the parking lot across campus so I could eat lunch alone again. Fast forward   years and I actually have a great job because of this guy.

So here is how I did it.  At the start of my sophomore year I started small by sitting in the front row next to people that were actually engaged in the class and I would ask them how their weekend was or how their other classes were going. After I got to know them the first couple of weeks I would ask them if they would like to stay after to work on the homework or study for the test. Then I would invite them to go to lunch or dinner. I found a common interest with some of them and did that with them. This is a long story but in summary one guy and I played ping pong in the rec every Tuesday my junior year.  He became one of my best college friends and we now talk every week even though he is   states away. Also when you are in group projects pull you weight and step up. People remember this and will want to work with you again. This is how I began to network. I hope this helps some.",4651,896,0

I have a learning disability that basically blocks me from studying anything STEM, because of the numbers, equations, calculus, etc.

I can't do anything about it, even though I'd tried very hard. I went to private tutors, always showed up to class, always did my homework, and tried to solve Maths problems in my free time. But absolutely nothing worked...

I got into a prestigious university, and into a hard Humanities program that I love. But every time I talk about that something's hard, people invalidate me because it's not STEM.

I don't even feel like a progressive young adult woman, because I'm not studying natural sciences.

And he said that he hates masks and if my college didn't require it, he'd snatch it off! He also proceeded to say that the USA has done more for the environment than any other country. He kept sprinkling in his conservative politics to all of the things he discussed. It drove me nuts. 

Also, on the ""optional reading"" page on Moodle, there's an article about socialism being bad. He's a soil science professor! Why is it necessary to put all of your political convictions (which are bigoted and dangerous in this era of COVID) out in the open? This is going to be a fun semester.

UPDATE: I filed a complaint to the dean's office yesterday. Today when I went into class, he used the plexiglass protector and did not complain about the mask at all.

1599309698.0,college,"To those wondering what it is like to go to a university THAT HAS NOT SHUT DOWNLet me start by saying  I have yet to get sick, but I have had to move locations the past month due to people around me becoming infected.

For sake of anonymity, I will not disclose my school directly. I will say I attend a college in Virginia that is currently getting hit hard with rona, and is a hot spot zone.  The most common thing I have seen people blame is that it’s people partying. Yes that is a factor but I will list all the things I have seen on campus.

 ) No mask enforcement, even though they market that they are mandated on campus.
  You can walk on campus and  if people do not have masks on, they are wearing them incorrectly. I witnessed a girl with a mask below her nose ,sneeze and not cover her nose.

 ) Buildings do not enforce policies
   I worked in a public area on campus and many  times students would overcrowd elevators, take off masks before they left the building, and come when they were sick. 

 ) staff and professors did not follow procedures 
Students are not the only one to blame. I would say that as many students that were not following procedures, staff and faculty were not either. On my first day back, a professor and student stood in-front of the library door talking less than   feet apart ( no masks on) and you literally had to go in between them to get into the building.

 ) The administration has their head in the sand
 While you notice everything wrong on campus you will continue to get  emails saying how great everything is. In a recent email , our president said that this outbreak was expected and it is coming to a head. They also said we have no evidence of community transmission on campus(blaming off campus students), even though positive COVID cases make up  /  of the county positive results.

 ) Not enough testing is being done
 Our university has a COVID dashboard and anyone with basic understanding of statistics will see how skewed the data is. They only tested kids coming from hot spots and just recently have held mass testing for willing individuals. They only update the information once a week. I was tested on a Friday and did not receive my results until that next Thursday, a day AFTER the university updated their weekly stats.(may just be a conspiracy I have).

 ) You can do everything right but it doesn’t matter if those around you aren’t.
I live with a roommate who doesn’t take COVID seriously. They think because they are young and “ Never get sick”, they shouldn’t worry. I did everything right and because others don’t take it as seriously, you will be affected.

 ) Faculty are struggling 
Professors are having a hard time teaching in this environment. I am very close with one of my professors and they relayed to me how stressful all this has been, especially being an older population and having vulnerable parents at home.

At this point I don’t know if we will shut down. I think it will take everyone overloading the isolation dorms or someone dying. The administration is full steam ahead...",3074,553,0

My professor accused me of plagiarism citing that our code was too similar, we made the same mistakes, and we both tried to turn them in late, around the same time.

After this, she said she didn't think I used ai, but that I was admitting to using Grammarly to help write my papers, which is cheating as per the academic dishonesty policy. I explained that all Grammarly does is help fix spelling and grammar and that it isn't different from Word's built-in spell check, and all she said was that she was familiar with Grammarly and felt the grade was appropriate.

1638319810.0,college,"EXAM TAKING TIPS (take 'em or leave 'em)Prof here -- I don't know how helpful this will be, but I thought I'd give a few tips for folks that are nervous about taking finals for the first time.

Just like my other advice, this is science-based.  Because all that feel-good vibes stuff drives me nuts. 

** .)  IF YOU HAVE TO ""CRAM"" DON'T DO IT THE NIGHT BEFORE.**   For instance, if you have only   days to study, breaking it into   hours per day per subject is way better than doing   straight hours the night before.

** .) ANKI IS YOUR FRIEND.**  Make the cards now, it's a fantastic way to memorize --but if you don't understand your flashcards, don't bother.  This is a memorizing thing (great for languages or formulas)  [

** .) MEMORY DEVICES:**

You might have heard of **PEMDAS** (P*arentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction*) make a word out of first letters.  If it doesn't make a word, make a sentence like...

  ""**K**eep **P**ots **C**lean, **O**r **F**amily **G**ets **S**ick"" for the taxonomy order of *Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species""* or if you're a scuba diver ""**B**ruce **W**illis **R**uins **A**ll **F**ilms"" for *""BCD, Weights, Releases, Final Check""*

** .) CALMING DOWN:**   Here's something I learned from freediving.  If you find yourself going into a major panic, you need to lower your heart rate.  You need to get it as slow as you can.  Now, a lot of folks achieve that through yoga/meditation.  I can't do that.  It just doesn't work for me.  It's too slow and I'm too distracted.  So I had to learn the scientifically proven heart rate lowering hack:

 ) Exhale for the count of  ... (this is hard).  A full slow count of  , so almost a full   seconds.  Not a fast  , but  ... ... ... ... ... ... ...  

 ) Hold breath for   seconds

    ) Inhale deeply for   seconds

    ) Hold breath for   seconds

Repeat starting at one.  If you don't believe it works, read this article about how some freediver's breathing can allow them to lower their heartbeat to the point where they can stay underwater for   minutes.  [  They do it using the breathing exercise, then going into deep cold water (which has to do with the mammalian dive reflex which you can't do unless your exam is underwater.)  

** .) GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP:**   *Tell your roommate to shut the fuck up.*  A good night's sleep is CRITICAL.   This is another reason you shouldn't cram the night before.  Your brain actually absorbs some stuff during sleep.  

** .) SKIM THE EXAM BEFORE YOU START ANSWERING QUESTIONS:**  I always suggest this to students, and then some of them don't take it.   So what happens?  They spend a half-hour working on a question they don't really know the answer to, and then run out of time -- and they aren't able to get to the questions that they absolutely do know the answers to.  Answer the questions you can ace FIRST. Then go back and tackle the others.

** .) WAKE UP EARLY.**  Rushing to class gets your heart rate up.  When your heart rate is up, you are more likely to panic.  When you panic, you are more likely to second guess yourself and more likely to make a mistake.  (again, ask any scuba diver.)

** .) EAT BREAKFAST IF YOU USUALLY EAT BREAKFAST.**   I know some people who just can't eat breakfast early.   But you don't want to be hungry during an exam.

** .) ONLY USE STUDY GROUPS WITH PEOPLE WHO GIVE A SHIT.**   I remember this from when I was in college.  We'd schedule ""study groups"" and do nothing but eat pizza and bitch about classes.  That was only until I did a study group with a roommate that was pre-med.  We were studying totally different things, but she'd give me flashcards, and I'd ask her questions, then I'd give her my flashcards and she'd ask me questions.   What really worked about that was that if I tried to give some bullshit explanation on one of my computer science answers she'd have no idea what I was talking about and would say... I don't know if that's the same as what's on here.   Ditto with her pre-med questions.  If she wasn't able to explain the answer in a clear way that I could understand as a non-premed student she knew she needed to work on it.   But with some of my friends, it wasn't so much of a study group as it was a pizza party with textbooks open.  

** .) READ THE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS!   READ THE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS!   READ THE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS!   READ THEM BACKWARDS IF YOU HAVE TO!**    I can't tell you how many of my really good students lose points because they didn't read carefully.   And they aren't trick questions!   I'll write something like ""Give two examples of scene transitions that do X"" and they'll list one.   The reason?  They just saw ""Give... transition.... do X"".   And boom - they lose   points on a   point question.

**FINALLY -- IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.**  This exam does not determine whether or not you get cancer.  It is not worth beating yourself up for.  Work your hardest to pass it, but if you can't -- I promise you that it's not the end of the world.  You're not a bad person because you failed an exam.  You're not going to get disowned. I promise that you're going to be okay.   Your career is a marathon -- if you slow down and don't do great on one mile, that's fine.  You've got   other miles to prove you're a hard worker.",5323,944,0

Thanks for the advice everyone. 

Basically I didn't read between the lines about the attendance policy and should have known that ""best possible steps to take"" means that she could fail me... Also I should have gone and talked to her after the  th absence, but I didn't.

So what I'm going to do now is try and hold out until Dec   and prioritize getting to this class...

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Original post:

I already talked with the prof about this. Prof does not grade attendance. Prof says ""if you don’t come to class (from now on), an F will be the only possible grade, unless you decide to withdraw. To my mind, a student who, at the beginning of October has   absences, has missed too many classes.""  is probably too many, and I thought Prof graded attendance and was going to take the low grade for that... Attendance is still kept in record and I have a  % but it doesn't actually count toward the final grade.

Even though I still have SOME attendance, prof said my work is ""excellent,"" AND I have an A in all assignments and tests/quizzes, prof says they will fail me... :)

ALSO university policy says I should attend class but that it is up to the prof to decide policy and it should be on the syllabus (which it was not...) Only thing on the syllabus about attendance was "" Students are allowed four absences during the semester. If students will miss more than four classes, the students have to report to the teacher as soon as possible to discuss the best steps to take to move forward."" and no grade penalties were ever mentioned.

Also the reason I don't go and am willing to take the fall is because I am a HS senior trying to balance work, school,   college classes, one HS class, and social life... I also struggle w/ depression and anxiety and most days I can't afford to drain my battery on a lecture that I don't need.

Basically what do I do to fix it and is it fixable? I don't want to escalate.

&#x B;

EDIT:

So these are not my first college classes... again I was prepared to take the zero grade for attendance (but it was my bad bc she doesn't actually grade attendance when I thought she did)

&#x B;

I have done this in all of my other college courses and I have As in the rest of my classes too...

&#x B;

I know   absences is too many and the prof reserves the right to say that its too many... The problem is the penalty which I was not made aware of and the fact that prof says they ""don't grade attendance"" when attendance apparently does directly impact my grades for assignments the rest of the semester.

I keep up with all slideshows and course content and I am not struggling to produce work. I mentioned I am in HS because I have one morning class at my HS that is at the same time as this class so I don't come all the time bc of that too.... I'm just wondering how I should talk to prof and what to do so I can continue doing the work & get the grades I earn without an automatic fail bc of low attendance.

Full-time semesters are HELL for me, and I recently changed majors from nursing to software engineering. The only way I can get out of college on time is if I tackle full-time semesters instead of just two courses, but how on earth are people surviving  + credits when they're dealing with calculus and upper level programming/engineering classes??

I got stares for coming by myself (but mostly from parents who'd brought along their kids), and when I said I was from CC, they just started staring more.

At another uni I was planning to go to (but did not because aforementioned uni accepted me), they had a session for those who'd been accepted to that major, and when I told the other students I was from community college, their jaws quite literally dropped and they were like ""Ur FrOm CoMmUnIty CoLlEge???"" and everything. Like...isn't it good to save money? Good thing I'm not going to that uni!

Since my uni requires a full-time semester GPA at the uni before applying to my major's actual program, I haven't gotten an Associate's yet (am one semester away from doing so, plan to finish it if I get rejected from my major's actual program). So just a bunch of credits from my cc.

On my first day of class this past week I had my Microbiology professor say some things I consider to be really unprofessional.  
  
First, as he begins his introduction he pauses to ask me and another student (we are seated in the front row) if it was okay if he didn't have his mask on while he was in the front of the class (which is JUST barely   feet away). He said he already cleared it with the Administration and as long as we were okay with it they would allow it.  
  
Then he goes into a spiel about how masks are pointless because they don't work; virus' are too small to be blocked by masks. When I questioned him on why would they mandate it if it didn't work he went into it about how Fauci is an idiot who was out of touch with reality and hasn't worked as a clinician since his residency many years ago.  
  
He also mentioned he got COVID-  last January though I find that odd because I don't even think they were testing for COVID-  at that point last year in the US.  
  
He then ends it with saying the only way to get over this mess that is COVID is herd immunity.  
  
Of course it's my fault for not speaking up right away, I just found it hard to when the whole class agreed immediately. I have a bit of social anxiety. But I do find all the things he said to be unprofessional. I know professors are human and can have opinions but I'm really put off by him asking if we would be ok with him taking his mask off.

I emailed all of my professors in regards to me being sick and provided a pretty generic doctors note just stating I have been under a doctors care. This was no issue for most of my professors except for one. Of course, it was the professor teaching the fully online elective course. He basically stated that the doctors note wasn’t enough to make up any assignment because the date had to be the whole week the assignment was open. So I pretty much just gave up on trying to make up any assignments in his class and just accepted that I’m going to do the best I can from here on out.

Well, two days later the professor reaches out to me via email basically asking if I left a rate professor review and how if I did it’s no hard feelings but everything I stated was basically untrue and I’m the only student with current health issues going on that’s why he knew it was me.

This might be silly, but I was proud of myself today. A little quick backstory. When I was a teenager, my mother married a very violent, felon and criminal. He would regularly beat us, terrorize us, and needless to say, it affected my education. I was kicked out of  th grade, and had to go to another school. From the age of   to   years old, I never went to the doctor, the dentist, went clothes shopping, or had a haircut. By the time I was   years old my hair was way past my bottom almost touching the back of my knees. I also graduated high school living in a homeless shelter. My mother and her ex, were addicts, and teenage years were absolutely horrible. I regularly read books from a very young age, so I had a healthy vocabulary, I was articulate and I knew how to spell very well. Anyway, my math education was lacking. Math is very formulaic, and I always had difficulty with it. Last semester, I got all A's, and this semester I just started taking career math. Today was my first day. These past couple months I went on Khan Academy to freshen up for math class. While in class today, the professor put a problem up on the board. A division sign, a minus sign and some parentheses. He asked the class for the answer, no one knew what it was. Because I practiced so much these past few months, I raised my hand and told him the answer. I found out that I was right, and he asked why, I said that parentheses means multiplication. It's really silly, but I felt proud of myself today. I've never been able to raise my hand in a math class and give a right answer, and the reasoning behind it. No matter what background you come from, you can do it.

1681454995.0,college,"Did I overreact about people having sex in the shower?Sorry for the long post in advance and I didn’t know if this was the right flair. I’m tired 🥲

I have been living in the same dorm hall since I was a freshman and when we have orientation, the staff always say “don’t have sex in the showers. It’s uncomfortable for other residents who also have to use that bathroom”. I’m a senior now and there hasn’t been any issues. 

I currently live in a room that shares a wall with the shower so I can hear when people start the shower or play music. Most of the time it’s relaxing as just white noise so never really had an issue. 

For the past  -  weeks there have been multiple instances of people using the shower as the sexy time spot. If this were a gender neutral bathroom and it was private in a sense that u had your own room. Probably wouldn’t care as much. 

 I have gone in to brush my teeth and the shower was going and I heard a dude in the shower with a girl, I just left and walked to the other bathroom down the hall. When I came back into my room I can hear them having sex. So I just put my headphones in and just try to forget about it. 

I’m in the bathroom and two people go in to the shower (I’m guessing they didn’t know I was there and I didn’t recognize it was   of them) until they start doing the thing. That’s when I just got up and left. Again frustrated but moved on. 

But within the past week there were multiple instances and it’s really becoming increasingly difficult to not say anything. Especially when this hasn’t been an issue before and I’m just trying to chill in my room and not hear other people’s sex experiences. 

Tonight I’m doing laundry and the same thing happens when I come back upstairs from doing the first load. It’s like  : pm and I talked to some of my friends about it before and they said I should talk to my RA/SRA. Luckily she was on duty. She is also my friend. I explain the situation and she agreed that it was uncomfortable and inappropriate. 

She did her RA duties and said she was gonna contact the RD about it to send out an email reminder to the building and that was the end. 

Until later when I’m finally finished at   am. So I just went and opened the door and said “people can hear you and this is a public bathroom for the people who live in this wing. It’s really uncomfortable to hear what’s going on” (not verbatim as I’m tired and over it) then I put up a sign that basically says the same thing (the SRA suggested it). After that they stopped at least with the noise as it’s also I was able to just chill and here we are. 

I just wanted to know if I was being unreasonable. As a college student myself sometimes u just gotta get it 🙃.

I stopped texting for a while, and he sent multiple messages asking where I was and if I was okay. I just felt weird. He texted me a couple weeks later and asked if we could talk about the project, and I said okay.

* Create an [FSA account]( (also known as the FSA ID). This is your legal electronic signature to sign the FAFSA. It's linked to your Social Security number. If you are a dependent student, one of your parents will need to make one as well, assuming they have an SSN. If your parent already has their own FSA account, they must use that. If your parent does not have an SSN, they must print and sign the signature page manually, then mail it in.

* Gather all necessary documents, including bank statements, tax information (W- s, tax returns), any records of untaxed income, etc.

* Start the FAFSA! If you or your parent are given the option to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool, use it! It will drag tax information from the IRS straight to the FAFSA and save you a lot of time.

I have   advisors because I minored in spanish, but my main advisor was horrible. She never responded to any of my emails and if she did it was two months later. So I assumed she was the issue, but I got an email over the weekend from my spanish advisor that I am   class short of graduating with a minor. Here's where the drama starts. I have   separate emails from this guy stating that studying abroad over the summer would complete my spanish minor because I was ""  class short of graduating with a minor"" then. But here's the thing, I was in   hours last semester and the study abroad fulfilled   classes or   credit hours, so I dropped the class I was in for the spring and signed up for the summer study abroad. I have an email asking for confirmation that ""I'm one class short now, so if I drop my current course and do the study abroad I will complete my spanish minor since it counts for two elective courses, right?"", to which I have two separate emails stating ""Yes, the study abroad will complete the spanish minor"".  

So what happens now? I dropped like $ ,  for this study abroad just to be told I'm still one class short when I was told last spring that it would be enough to complete it. 

UPDATE: So my main advisor still has not responded (grr) but my Spanish advisor did respond to my email to him. I informed him of our previous messages and he emailed me back this morning saying he now sees the classes from over the summer and it WILL complete my minor. Woohoo.

Ah, you are about to enter college and have high hopes and dreams for what you are going to do in college. People tell you it will be the best   years of your life and you will make so many memories. Enjoy this time because you will never get it back in your life. Also, this is the phase in life where you should be experimenting and trying things because, after all, you have so much more freedom than you ever might have in your life (yeah right).  


You enter college and maybe a year goes by, and well, you just feel extremely letdown and intense FOMO.  


This pretty much sums up my freshman year. I had envisioned myself joining technical clubs, and social clubs, going to parties, and making lots of friends and memories. I had created this very high ""image"" of what I expected from my college life. This image and expectation had just led to disappointment as I wasn't able to achieve them.  


Making friends was replaced by low confidence, low self-esteem, and image issues. Joining clubs was replaced with anxiety about grades and schoolwork. Going to parties was replaced by being a horrible networker who couldn't meet people. Going to college events was replaced with fear of chaos. I think you get the point here.   


What contributes to this anxiety is when people emphasize how important it is to make friends, maybe get in relationships, network in clubs, and go to social events and how we will miss out on this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. For me, this created intense FOMO. I'd wake up and beat myself up for having less life experiences than others and this lack of experiences affected my confidence because I thought I was just boring. Whenever I see others having fun, I fear that I am missing out and I will never get this chance again.   


I thought I was alone until talking with other peers and reading so many Reddit posts about how people are worried about missing out. I think this whole idea of ""college life"" is just a narrative shoved down our throats but the reality is that like no one achieves this.   


Throughout this first year, I learned just how bad I am at meeting people and forming friendships and just experiencing life in general. The whole ""have fun in college"" just feels like a scam. I've decided I'm gonna completely tilt in the other direction next year. I'm gonna focus on building my ego and my skills. Basically set me up to be a successful person after graduating college. If I can't have experiences and friendships, I'd at least want to grind life, do good in college, and become successful.  


I wouldn't say this often, but I would encourage some of you who feel stuck in a similar way to do something similar. Go grind at the gym and get a body. get a high GPA. start a club/business project because frankly, my ego and drive is the only thing I have faith in at this point.",2958,527,0

1571526145.0,college,"My roommate rarely leaves the roomSo this is one of those complaints that really does get the response ""Suck it up, everyone gets bad roommates,"" but I'm about to lose my mind. I can generally handle roommates from hell. I'm a sophomore, I went to boarding school for   years and had roommates lock me out of the room for tinder hookups, hide drugs in my fridge, and was once roomed with someone who hated my guts, but I can't handle this. As it stands, I'm living in an  x  room with someone who hardly leaves. All of our classes are at the same times, so I can't even rely on time to myself while she's in class. She always eats in the room, either microwaving her food in her microwave, or only leaving for roughly   minutes to go pick it up and come back. I know the typical response is to just tune her out, but I also have ptsd and am hypervigilant and literally can't do that.

Honestly, if it was just her not leaving, I'd likely be fine, but she's also very controlling of the environment in the room. She always wants the lights off and the heat on. If I even turn on the small light she gets up and turns it off within   minutes. It kills my head to be on my computer or phone with the lights off. The heat makes it so I can't sleep because I'm way too warm and literally wake up drenched in sweat. I can't work on my computer after she lays down to sleep because apparently she can't sleep with me typing, which isn't loud in the slightest, but I'm constantly hearing her music through her headphones and she won't turn it down.

I'm incredibly wound up right now because I have no privacy and am not allowed to take up space in my own room. Even if I leave the room (as I did today, I've been out for   hours), its not the same as alone time and I still have no personal space.

1702234638.0,college,"Heard my roommate tell her friend that I ""literally never leave"" the dorm while she thought I was asleep. I think it's time for a change and I need help.So, my college life so far has been extremely bland. I've made   friends, and spend the majority of my time with at work, working on homework, or alone.

Working   jobs, one of them which kinda makes me miserable, kinda results in me being chronically underslept and as an invidual I've always been depressed and a loner. I've had   friends since middle school because some extreme trauma I went through made me extremely socially incapable since it resulted in me becoming mute and it's kind of hard to make friends with people when you can't speak to them. Although I've mostly recovered from the mutism, the social aspects of it still haunt me as being alone basically the entirety of my childhood has kind of trained me to prefer that way of living.

Freshman year I briefly attempted to make friends with my dorm hall but the social interactions were so mentally painful and exhausting for me I eventually gave up on it. And when I did eventually make one friend last year they were emotionally and financially abusive to me, and we kinda existed in a codependent relationship until I eventually cut them off during summer. I can understand my struggles freshman year since I'd just gotten out of an abusive household an was trying to cope with the changes. But even back then I feel like i left the dorm more.

This semester, I've just had even less motivation to make friends after cutting off the previously toxic one and knowing that everyone has basically settled into their frirnd groups. Because of that I know I've been in the dorm WAY more. But hearing it from the perspective of my roommates kinda stings. I've never wanted to be that kind of roommate. Kinda hurts more since I'd just got off an opening shift and decided to actually sleep for once, otherwise I wouldn't have been in the dorm right now because I DO leave sometimes. But still, I understand from having a roommate who never leaves how annoying it can be and I don't wanna be that person.

Not sure what to do.I had one class left to get my degree. The entirety of the class is a single group project; make a website to do X (don't want to get too specific). The professor did not give any explicit or written requirements for the project, just a few sentences at the start of the semester. Imagine something like ""Go make a site that behaves like Reddit. It should have users, mods and admins. Users can make posts, comments and edit them. Mods can do what users do + delete posts and comments. Admins can do what mods do + delete users, create users"". That was the level of detail.

We scheduled time with him last week to review it. We asked to schedule in advance because I have a kid and needed to get a babysitter. We were scheduled at  : pm. We got there early but at  :  when he arrived he sat down with another group. He didn't see us until  : . He looked at our site, logged in, tried the first link and was unhappy with what it did. He told us we failed, we clearly didn't meet the business requirements, we're not a good group and should find new partners and that we should start from scratch. He then said he had a class to teach soon soon and that we had to leave, he would not talk with us anymore.

It was insane. We had an entire semester of work into a site and he gave us literally <  mins and said we failed. I emailed him the next day asking him to please look again, there must have been a misunderstanding (was trying to be polite) and that we had a fully functional site. He responded the next day saying that he did not meet any business requirements, our implementation was entirely incorrect and we need to start over.

&#x B;

I emailed him again, reiterating the misunderstanding and listing off several business requirements we met (the things he said in the beginning of the semester) and that we just wanted him to review the entirety of our site because he only visited a single page. He agreed. We met with him yesterday and sat down for **  hours** reviewing our site. He was hostile and he nitpicked every single little thing, none of which were requirements he mentioned.  Things like: our site used military time instead of standard time. That one of the sections of the site only listed the user's email, not their phone number (email was a requirement, phone number was never mentioned) etc etc. At one point he complained we were missing something, I told him he could find it at a different part of the site and he said ""if you want to argue with me i'll just leave"". At the end he said he was going to mark our project as Incomplete, that we should both find new partners, we had a ton of work to do and that all our data was bad.

&#x B;

I do not believe it was possible to pass this class. I don't know if he had a grudge against me for some reason, if its because my group was entirely women, because im young and have a kid or what. I'm not claiming our site was perfect, we definitely missed some details here and there, but i'm  % confident it should have been sufficient to pass (its a graded class but hes just marking it as incomplete). I've reached out to other groups in the class and the majority failed and many of them were taking this class for the  nd or  rd time. He's been the only professor to teach this class for a few years but after enough complaints they added a  nd professor this semester apparently.

I'm not sure what to do. I landed my dream job and i'm supposed to start in   weeks. I don't know what's going to happen if they find out I didn't graduate. I'm not sure if I should try to complain to my advisor, or head of department or if that's just a waste of time that will make him dislike me even more for next semester.

Any advice on what to do? I'm terrified of whats going to happen with my job in   weeks. I'm afraid to email my professor asking for am actual grade or any clarification of what exactly he's looking for,  because i'm afraid it will set him off. I'm just not sure what to do.

My third year I had to move to the tiny satellite campus away from the main one away from my friends so that sucked super hard.  Then just when things started to look better COVID hit.  And everything just went to shit.

So now I'm accustomed to half assing everything.  Why go to class when you could just go to a zoom meeting.  Why pay attention in class when you can just look at the notes later.  Why bother to study for anything since every test is open note open book open internet.  I'm not really learning, I'm struggling to complete meaningless tasks.  When you compare my first year of college, I was in a classroom half the day, studying in the library, sleeping in the dorms, making friends and partying.  Now compare that to now, I'm half listening to lectures on my phone at my apartment, getting B's on open note open internet tests, trying to piece together what I'm supposed to do from canvas announcements, emails, and groupMe messages.

so my main question is… do guys find it weird when girls make the first move? i barely know the guy, he doesn’t even know my name, and he isn’t in any of my classes. i think he’s in one of the ceramics classes before mine, so im able to see him once my class ends and i have a break. i only know a few things about him from my friend. isn’t it strange to ask someone for their insta or snap or whatever just based off of one interaction and the fact that i find him cute?

**FAQ About Friends in College**


**What should I do when I arrive on college to meet people**

Okay so the first week on campus- especially in the dorms- there is a bit of magic in the air. Everyone is nervous and while some people may have friends from highschool or from their childhood- pretty much everyone is looking to make friends. Take advantage of this!!!!

* Be friendly and talk with people on your floor and in your building. Introduce yourself. Say your major, where you're from, what hobbies you have, etc. Its all small-talk but later on when you see them in the hall it will be easier to strike up conversation 

* Take Initiative. Instead of just saying hi to people- invite some people out to dinner. Or be that one person that organizes dinner with the entire floor (its not weird. Its college. Just fucking do it). If large groups scare you- find a few friendly faces on your floor and ask if they're up for dinner- or going to that cool, definitely not lame freshman event on campus. Or ask if someone wants to go watch the opening football game with you. Or ask if they just want to explore campus. It may be awkward asking people you don't know- but it will be worth it as the friendships grow stronger. 

* Keep your door open. Even if you don't take initiative other people probably will. But if you stay locked up in your room all day then no one will know you're there and you will feel left out. Keep the door open and I promise you there's a good chance you'll just get invited places. Even if you keep your door open don't just stay in your room staring at the wall. Go to the common areas- if you see people socializing just go them. Its not awkward. Its college. Just walk up and say ""Hi I'm chevy- where are you guys from"" or literally anything no one cares. You might meet some cool people, you might not. Might make some friends this way, might not. Still worth a shot. I made some of my friends in college the first week by just randomly talking about anime and CS with strangers- anything can happen. 

* Always say yes. If someone asks you to go to some random book event in the campus center SAY YES. When you start saying no and stop saying yes people will stop asking you to go places. You know all those lame sounding events in the dorms? Yeah no one really goes to them because they care about face painting. They go to meet people. Put yourself out there and don't reject opportunities to meet people

**What if I go to a commuter campus, community college, or live off campus?**

Not to worry my friend. Remember there are people in your shoes too and they want to make friends as well. 

The main advice I would give for people in this situation is to try and stay on campus as much as you can. If you are a commuter student- don't just head home after class. Stay on campus! Engage in any club activities and set your study schedule around these activities. Or get a job on campus. Or just study at the library on campus or wherever! Its hard to make friends when you're never at school. 

Also try talking to a lot of people in your classes. Obviously don't disrupt actual class time- but asking people in your classes if they want to study together or even just saying hi can start friendships. Don't be shy! 

**Its after the first week of school and I still have no friends. What can I do?** 

There are many things you can do! Here are some suggestions: 

* Talk to people in classes. Since class is well underway- you can talk to people in class about current assignments, upcoming assignments, upcoming tests, etc. Its not weird- its college. People are nice! If it is farther in the semester you can ask someone if they want to work on an assignment together or study together. I've never been told no when I asked someone- you typically learn better when you work together anyways!!

* Join a club on campus. Its easier to meet people when you share a common interest- and if you join the hiking club because you like hiking then surely you'll meet people there who also like hiking. Now you have a conversation topic of ""hiking"" you can talk to them about. Yay! If you have no interests you can always just join a club related to your major or career goals and socialize with people there (but if you join the club for your major you can't use the famous 'what's your major' question when first meeting someone). You can also join clubs if you have no knowledge of them and are potentially looking at a new hobby. 
In any case- clubs typically advertise to (mainly) freshmen at the start of each semester- so if your school has an area where the clubs set up little information booths like my school did- just go and talk to some members and get a vibe for the club. If the people seem cool- just join and hope for the best! 


* Get a job on campus. I know, it sounds crazy. But a lot of jobs in college are social and I know I personally made a lot of friends through my job. Even the people working in the dishroom at the dining halls in my school typically talk to each other and work shifts with each other frequently- so its a great way to meet coworkers. And there's never a chance you'll run out of things to talk about at your job because worst case scenario just complain about how working sucks and everyone will agree with you! Win-win. 

* If you live in a dorm: Talk to people!!! A lot of freshmen take the same classes. If you see someone in a study lounge (or similar) and they are working on an assignment for your class- there's no harm in asking them if they want to study with you! Or if you recognize someone in your building from one of your classes you can literally just be like ""Oh hey aren't you in Accounting  ?"". Then you can progress the conversation into asking them if they want to work on class stuff together- and if they live in the same building it'd be super easy to do so!


* Partake in random activities! At my school a lot of people would play pool/ping pong in the dorms and a lot of people would just ask to play or jump in and I got to meet some people that way. Or people play Frisbee outside, or random other games. Its not weird to ask someone if you can play- I promise you. Worst they can say is no- best they can say is yes and you end up with new friends (and have a cool game to play with them too!). 


* Go to parties/other social events. You don't have to drink/smoke/do anything you don't like. Parties have lots of people and its a very social setting- so obviously the potential to meet people there is possible. Even if you're awkward or introverted- plenty of people like that go to parties too. There are also just random events happening daily on campus- all of them can be good ways to find people to talk to!

**I am a sophomore/junior/senior/ and have no friends can I still make friends?** 

Of course. People are looking to make friends no matter what year they are. I made new friends every year I attended college- people do not just stick with who they met freshman year. 

**I don't like my friends, what do I do? Am I stuck with them?**
No, Silly. You can always get new friends. If you don't like your current friendgroup- make sure you don't spend all your time with them. Try to branch out by meeting new people in classes, joining a club, getting a new job on campus, etc. Eventually when you make new friends- you can leave your old friends behind. There are other tips earlier in the guide- you can always follow those if you relied a bit too much on the dorm magic to make your freshman friends!

**Do all your close friends come from freshman year?**

No. While its easier for friendships to become stronger if they start freshman year because you have   years to develop a strong bond with someone- close friends come from any year. The person I lived with for a few years I met freshman year- but the person I would call my closest friend I met my sophomore year in college. Some of the closest people that I remain in contact with after graduation I only met late Junior year or even senior year of college. You can make close friends any year- you never know who you may end up meeting!

**Am I the only one that feels so lonely?** 

No. 

Like I said- it is the most common topic on our sub. Lots of college students struggle with the adjustment. You are not alone. Stay strong and try to follow the tips I outlined in the rest of this little guide to make some friends. If you put in the effort I would find it very difficult to believe that you can't make a single good friend. 


**Still having trouble making friends?**


**RELAX**. Making friends takes time and effort. You cannot expect to make close friends immediately. Continue being yourself and you will find friends eventually. No one likes someone who is miserable because they feel alone. Remain positive and remember that there are other people in your shoes too. There is nothing wrong with feeling lonely in college, I'm sure most people on this sub have experienced it at one point or another. Keep doing you, take a deep breath, and enjoy college! The   years fly by quick. 


**Is there anything I should avoid to increase my potential to make new friends?**


*Yes*: 

* Avoid staying in your room all day. You cannot make friends if you hide from people 

* Avoid not talking to people. You cannot make friends if you are silent. I know I am a very quiet person but if I can force myself to talk to new people you can too. 

* Avoid remaining comfortable. Those   friends from highschool that came with you to college? Don't spend all your time with them. Branch out. Meet new people. Step out of your comfort zone. 


* Avoid not showering. If you smell bad people are less likely to talk to you 

* Avoid posting on this sub about not making friends. This won't help you make friends. Get off reddit and talk to real people instead. We can be your friends too but it probably won't replace the loneliness you feel in real life. 





I was by no means a social butterfly in college and felt loneliness plenty of times- especially being the only one at my out of state college from my highschool (ever!!). Stay calm, remain positive, and try to follow the basic advice outlined in this thread. Good luck! ",11025,2044,0

I’ve lived in my apartment for a month now with a new roomate that I don’t know.

There was one time last week though where I was sitting on the couch in the living room and he was in the kitchen (in view of each other). I again tried to start a conversation with him because it was quiet and I thought it was a good opportunity. I forgot what I said but as soon as I said it he stopped cooking, looked over at me and stared for at least a minute, then went right back to cooking. Completely ignored me. I finally decided it’s not worth my time to try to even be friends with him since he’s a senior in college and he’s moving out at the end of the year. Our other   roomates don’t move in until August.

1698560916.0,college,"Professor sent an angry email. Should I be worried?So I'm taking this class with a very respected professor in his field (International level) and I'm enjoying the material of the course very much. We had an exam this week, and I asked him a question through an email saying ""Hey, when I was writing the exam, I thought of a few questions I wanted to ask"" and proceeded to ask them in the email (I was interested in the topics, so I had some out of interest questions), but I was met with ""The exam is done, why would you want more questions"" and proceeded to answer my questions somewhat rudely by telling me to ""Google it"". I mean, the professor's job is to answer questions students have rather than tell them to google it so I found it unprofessional. I was interested in the material so I wanted to volunteer for his lab at first, but now I don't think so. Usually, he's really friendly in emails and in person, I don't understand why he answered so harshly. Did I say anything wrong? How worried should I be? Am I overthinking this?

1644234128.0,college,"A professor just called me manipulative and disrespectfulI'm not from the USA, but in my university most exams and midterms are coordinated by the head professor of each subject, so they are the ones that decide the dates, the content, the exam format, etc. Well this semester I noticed that I had two different midterms on the same day, one from  :  to  :  am and the other one  : - :  am, so while they didn't overlap since they are being held in different buildings being on time to the second one would be impossible without finishing very early the first one. So I decided to write a formal email to both head professors, to see if anything could be done to ensure that we're able to take both exams on time, since both subjects are for second years normally the are more lenient and understanding with this stuff. The first head professor responded very quickly and told me that he couldn't do anything, the second head proffesor informed me that in this particular case she isn't the one in charge but the proffesor of our respective class is. So naturally I decided to talk to them instead, I write the same email and after a week without a response I decide talking to her directly. Here is where things escalated very quickly...

Basically she was deeply offended by the suggestion, acted like I was saying her subject was less important than the other therefore she must be the one to take on the extra work of changing It, I tried explaining that It certainly wasn't the case the other one just had said no already, and that I just wanted to see if she was open to the possibility to discuss It with the class. She then got somehow more offended and acted like I was trying to undermine her by asking first the headprofessor (again, they are the ones to deal with this stuff in most cases, how could I have known that in this case an exception was made for the midterms??), and called me manipulative for trying to talk her into changing things around (again, I just asked! No harm in asking...) especially without my peers present (I wanted the opportunity to discuss this matter in class with her permission!!). I felt incredibly humiliated and apologised many, many times for 'disrespecting her', but she was having none of It, I even ended up crying a little because I don't handle well people yelling at me and I already had a lot going on (kinda like the last drop to overflow the glass) but she just said that 'I won't be led on by any manipulative behaviour or mannerisms of yours, in any case you should be crying for the utter lack of respect you have towards me'

I feel awful, humiliated, and the worst part is that I can't avoid her classes by any means (mandatory subject, with group projects and I can't let down my teammates). Sorry if this is messy, I needed to write It down somewhere",2814,514,0
1592311404.0,college,"If you could give a freshmen a tip about dorming, what would it be?For me, I’d say: 

Every roommate has a small, petty habit that gets on your nerves. And yes, you probably have one that gets on their nerves, too, they just don’t tell you. It could be something like they put their calls on speaker or never leave the dorm except for class. In my experience, I had a roommate who would always lock the door into our bedroom because she was scared we’d get robbed. Our room was a suite with three rooms: the kitchen/living room and two bedrooms, and the front door. This got kind of annoying at times because I’d always have to get my keys from off the counter after putting them down. And one morning, I was half asleep and needed to use the bathroom so I got locked out of my bedroom because I didn’t realize she locked the door. This is coming from somebody with anxiety disorder who worries about safety to an ungodly degree, it was annoying, and our school is in a bad area, so you better believe it’s well guarded. Because of this, there’d be times when she’d lock herself out and make me stop what I was doing on campus to go open the door, as you only got three free tries from security before they fined you. 

But it’s a small petty habit like that, who gives a shit? You’re allowed to be annoyed but your roommates are going to have that. If it’s something like they go through your clothes without permission or make you uncomfortable, then tell an RA.",1464,275,0

My father passed away last Friday and it has been really hard on me. On top of already suffering from PTSD, it's definitely a really difficult time for me to get through. My mother offered to sit in class with me as support. Not chatting or anything, but her being near is the only time that I feel comfort. It feels like the only way I'll be able to get through the first few weeks of the semester without withdrawing.

Is it strange that I want this? The professors I have emailed so far seem to be fine with it. But I get the idea that people are probably going to look at me negatively.

Best wishes.

I'm taking a Women's studies course that I'm pretty sure fulfills a GE requirement of some kind. We have online discussions even though the class in in person and the professor put us into groups online because the class is rather large. So many of the replies to these discussions are so empty and lacking any thought. It is like they lack any critical thinking or like they simply want to reply to the discussions and get the points. The guidelines say that our replies are supposed to be ""substantive add to the discussion (i.e. reflecting on their response, asking questions, etc.)"" but none of my classmates in the group do that. And on top of that the grammar is horrible and at least one of these with shit grammar is a *senior.* All my classmates do is agree to whatever the other person posted and then say something like ""it was really interesting"" or ""what you wrote made a lot of sense"". Two others along with myself try to follow the guidelines as best as we can. I struggle because there is nothing of substance to reply to.

>What caught my attention about you response is that you explained both questions. Not only that but I also say that you quoted your source. I feel that quoting your source gives more credibility to your response.

The above is a reply from one classmate to another. I can't help but laugh because our professor said that since we were all reading the same book we didn't need to site the source. We could paraphrase and use quotes from the book without worrying that we would be docked points for plagiarizing. I also can't help but laugh because that person's reply is so empty. Perhaps it is because the professor is very lenient with grading, maybe that's the issue here. I read these replies and I'm shocked these are university students. This was shit that I was writing as a freshmen in high school, back when I didn't care about my grades. But this is university for crying out loud, I thought the level of discussions and writing would be at third year uni level.

Anyway, is this just an issue in the U.S that is a reflection of our shit education system? Or am I seeing some sort of generational issue here? Thoughts?

Again, this isn’t a problem so long as I’m not in my bed trying to sleep, but when I do go to bed, and my roommate isn’t in the dorm (he often doesn’t come in until very late), the cat starts crying and trying to get in bed with me, which I don’t like because those beds are small enough without a cat trying to cuddle into them as well. If anyone’s been through dorm life with a cat, could you please give me some advice on how to maybe keep the cat calm during the night, or maybe something to keep it from jumping onto my bed? Thank you all so much, and have a good one.",1017,207,0

1633814604.0,college,"My Advice: If you ever feel slow and dumb or are struggling in a class, focus on overcoming the difficulty instead of your intelligence and trust in that processI mean my dad told me a story about when he was a student. He was in a spatial geometry class and he was the slowest one in the class. Everybody else seems to be much quicker then him. However, he never gave up and tried his best. He eventually overcame all difficulties and become even better at the subject then everybody else. 

I have a mental illness that causes me to constantly assess my intelligence and care too much about it, even if their's no evidence that I was struggling in any classes. I always think to the future about some difficult classes coming up and I'm worried I'm going to be the slowest and stupidest one in the class. I always have the tendency to put myself in the shoes of another (such as a mathematician) or to think myself in a certain situation (such as being in a programming class) and then always ending up forming the conclusion that I might be below average or stupid (even if I wasn't struggling in any classes this semester at all). I always think back to the one programming class in which I have to take as a accounting major that I struggled with more than others. I always go to my dad for advice when such thoughts pop up. 

My dad's advice is usually this, and I feel it helped alot. He taught me to focus on the effort, not your innate talent or intelligence. He said for me to be positive and ignore such thoughts and focus on what you're supposed to be doing. I feel that this helped alot. I mean programming is kinda my own fault as I didn't work hard enough to overcome it and focused more on intelligence instead. 

My dad taught me a story of how he's the slowest one at work (I'm not sure if he's making this up or not), he's a engineer. He said everybody is faster then he is at figuring stuff out, however he still didn't feel discouraged or give up (despite not being the sharpest knife in the drawer). Instead he used whatever cards that he's dealt to work hard to figure things out (even if it takes him longer) and asks other's for help when needed. Eventually he ends up performing equally as well or even better then the people that are supposedly smarter and quicker.

The point of me telling everybody this is that if you ever feel that you're slow and dumb and aren't the sharpest knife in the drawer, you shouldn't focus to much on the fact that you aren't naturally smart or as quick witted as some other people. Instead you should focus on trying to overcome the difficulty and believe in the fact that if you try hard enough and never give up, everything's eventually going to click. If you struggle with applying what you learned or with logical thinking, do more practice and eventually things would get easier. 

Remember their are people with good genes that don't make the best of their abilities simply because they're lazy and that hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard. 

If you're naturally smart, then great. But if you aren't, just trust in the process and not give up.",3126,575,0
1705439400.0,college,"Changed my Major without telling my parents...idk how I'm going to tell themMy parents are really strict, and they wanted me to stick with CS because they know it's a good career path. Yes, I am pretty experienced, and I understand technology well, but I am not happy, and do not look forward to doing this for the rest of my life. I had mentioned not liking computer science, and the classes are well, but I can't keep doing it. I feel unhappy doing coding all day, math, physics, all that etc. Despite me getting As in the class and all that, I just wasn't passionate. I felt dull.

I pay for my own college btw. I have to because it's my responsibility they say, which is true. But if I feel as if I have the right to change my major, because it's my responsibility right? I can already feel their anger even though I didn't tell them. My parents AREN'T the typical communication parents. They yell and scream, fuss, and fight. There's no winning with them. I think I'll just take the heat tbh. This sucks but my current major, I'm thriving in all ways possible. I feel good, and its something I wanted to do from the start lol.

For everyone asking, I switched to **welding**. You don't need college for it, but I just need to finish this year of it and I'm good. The least I can do is just get the degree, and head to the union. I already did practice for underwater welding in the pool lmao.

Since meeting my roommate  at the beginning last college semester (August), he’s never seemed to have a problem with me being shirtless in the mornings before class, or when I’m in the dorm for the night (the only time I’m really in the dorm). Being shirtless has always been more comfortable for me, and in my own personal home, I typically walk around shirtless. 

Last night, he expressed his feelings and said he doesn’t like me being shirtless in the room because it makes him feel insecure. I’ve always invited him to workout and run with me and this isn’t the first time I’ve heard him complain about his weight.

Of course I have never harassed, bullied, or even cared how much he weighs or about his physical appearance. For me however, the dorm room is the one space where I feel like I can truly decompress and relax. 

Is my roommates request reasonable? 

I’m not sure if extra information is needed, but more then happy to give more info.

Edit: I’m always fully clothed in the room, I’m only not when either getting dressed, out of the shower, or coming to the dorm for the night.

Edit: I’m glad this had a lot of responses to see both sides from people who agree with me and my roommate , I talked with my roommate about the shirtless thing and asked if we could compromise as he has things that annoys me and obviously I have things that annoy him.

I stopped by target to get a pack of tank tops (I’ve never owned any before and am not even sure how to spell it correctly) as I wouldn’t want my roommate or anyone to be uncomfortable. However, I did express that there are instances like sleeping, getting dressed in the morning, and getting out of the shower where I would be shirtless as I get ready for the day, or for the bed. Hopefully it’ll be better from here on out and thank you for everyone who commented!!

I have a track record of getting behind on work and being unable to catch up, so I procrastinate and waste my time trying to delude myself into thinking I’m ok when I should really be doing work. This has been a thing since high school.

They made me promise that I wouldn’t fail any more classes, and that if I did, they would stop financially supporting me with college and other things.

1545930000.0,college,"Just a few things to consider while on break...\- REST DAMMIT. You need to actually sleep and take care of yourself. You were looking forward to this time, so you better take advantage of it. I know, you are only home for a limited time and you want to see all your friends. That's cool. But take some small time to actually take care of yourself.

\- If you are spending it at home, then please spend some time hanging out with your parents and family. If you got them nearby, go see your grandparents. Looking back, I wish I would have just spent a bit more time with my mom when I was home.

\- Check your grades. Celebrate, cry, ponder, but take a moment to really look at where you are and see if you are doing as you expect. Not liking your classes? Still want to major in that? Is this your  rd time taking a course? Sit down and really evaluate where you are, and if you are taking the right steps to get to where you think you want to go.

\- Check on your funds. Those of you that are lucky to have your parents pay for your education, please do not take it for granted. If you know you are going to be short for the next semester, look at job options, loans, and any possible scholarships. Mapping out how much you are going to owe before you start can put you in a better position.

\- If you are considering not going back to school, like you are for sure not going back, TELL SOMEONE. You do not need a big fat bill showing up on your doorstep because you failed to withdraw the correct way. Tell admissions, tell a family member, and talk to someone. Do not assume that this will be taken care of.

\- If you are feeling down over break, find someone to talk to. Yes, it is okay to text a friend and say ""Hey, if you got a minute to talk or hang, I would really appreciate it. I am not doing well right now."" Reach out to people. Talk it out. Do not bottle things up. Help is out there.

\- If your graduation is in the upcoming year, or you know you are going to be doing a lot of interviews soon, make sure you got a professional sounding email and an updated resume.

1654789937.0,college,"A Lot of Students Have Really DeclinedI hope I don't sound like those ""holier than thou"" profs, but I need to say this: COVID has really made some students get lazy and more entitled. I am an undergraduate myself, and I have been TAing for four semesters now. Most of my students are great or they don't cause any problems. But this semester I definitely had a few bad apples. For context, I TA general physics classes meant for biology and chemistry majors. I try to understand that taking a physics class after lots of biology can be challenging for them and they do not know as much math, and I try to be cognizant of their situation, but some of the behaviors and excuses I have seen are just completely ridiculous.

One student did not know how to use the chain rule when a semester of calculus   is a prerequisite and then complained how unfair it was they have to know how to take derivatives. I explained that yes they need to know how to do derivatives as that's a prereq for this course and it is their responsibility to review those derivative rules if they feel like they need to brush up.

Another student got a question completely wrong, so I explained the correct answer and why they were wrong and they said ""Yeah obviously we know that; we're not stupid."" They then proceeded to call me rude and condescending for correcting their mistake. I even asked how they felt I could be more conscious while correcting them and the student couldn't tell me anything.

A student gave me a very low score in TA evaluations because they felt it was unfair that they have to solve the workshop problems themselves and that I should be doing them on the board for everyone (yes someone actually said this). I decided to write more setups and important concepts and equations on the board to help, but some students called me lazy and distant for only doing this because ""he doesn't want to do the work.""

This is the one that takes the cake though. I had to grade their participation in workshop. The professor told the TAs to have   out of   points for just attending and the other   points for how much they participated. This one group of students did not participate that much, so I did not give them  /  on their workshop grade. They emailed me saying how they feel that my grade for them was so unfair. I did not have much faith in how much work they did, so I wanted to see if they could back it up, so I told them I would raise their grades if they could show me written work for the workshops and gave them a deadline. Most of the group followed through, and i raised their grades accordingly. Then they responded saying how they feel that it is so ""hurtful"" that I didn't raise their grades even more. One student did not make the deadline and emailed me a day after, and I just said ""No I'm sorry. You were late, so I will not be raising your grade,"" and then I got a nasty email after that as well.

While most students I work with are great, I keep seeing an increase in this ridiculous entitled behavior, and this is ridiculous. Is anyone else seeing this, or does this seem to only be a problem at my college?

Edit: For the comments describing how COVID has been very rough for them, I can sympathize. COVID has definitely affected many students negatively and caused them struggle. Most profs and TAs are aware of this. That said, I think it is best to email profs and TAs and explain your situation and explain the ways you need support, not make entitled demands and not put in any kind of effort. Many students have constructively talked to me about this, and we were able to find a solution. But if you just use COVID as an end all be all excuse, especially for poor behavior, I'm not going to have a lot of sympathy for you. ",3750,696,0

1698142570.0,college,"Sunk   hours into two essays for them to count towards my grade.Edit: sunk five hours into two different essays just for them to not count towards any grade (even final grade)


Does anyone consistently do work for it not even count towards anything numerical in the class?

Yesterday I had two exams, one which I studied for about   hours, the other three hours. Then I had work- just a six hour shift. Then I get back home to spend five hours on writing essays that aren't even being graded. I think I went to bed at   just to go to clinical at  . I'm running on four hours of sleep, I'm so cold and so exhausted. This is every week, doing the shit for this stupid art class which has more work involved than my pharmacology course. 

I'm a nursing student, I am past the point of caring about getting good grades, I just want to pass my non-core classes.

Should I talk to the prof? I'm not at work enough, I'm getting in trouble for not making the hours, I don't have enough time to study, I don't have enough time do spend on things that don't count for a grade. 

I'm a junior, my last  .  semesters. What do I even do?

Edit: okay, since some of you have issues with my post I'm going to make this crystal clear. 

Yes I am doing two degrees at once, yes this is possible. Look it up, lots of bachelor programs are partnering with different schools connected to magnet hospitals. I will graduate with my associates next may, and my bachelors the next may after that. Hence why I'm focused on my nursing courses and not my gen Ed's. Thank you so much to the person that pointing out my grammatical mistakes. I'm so sorry that I made this post when I was upset and on four hours of sleep and also on the OB surgical floor (high acuity if you're not in the medical field). So I was quite busy at the time and no my professional writing does not look like that. I am taking   credits, this art class is one credit, my clinical are   credits, my lab is   credit, my pharm course is three credits, my OB/PEDS/ MED SURGE course is three credits and I'm also taking a philosophy course for three credits. Im trying to finish my bachelors as fast as possibly, I never take a break, I take one class every winter break and three classes over summer. I've always done this and yes it sucks but school sucks and I want to get it over with. 

This class is not an art history course, it's called art anatomy where we have to pick events that we do essays and class presentations on, so every week two essays and two presentations plus traveling to an art Museum/ show to gather data. All in all this class takes me about   hours per week just to do the bare minimum. Which seems excessive since that's not accounting for the three hours of class time that it takes up during the week.

For those of you who encouraged me to talk to my prof, I did end up going to her in person after class. They do count for a grade, she was just using the wrong syllabus attached to the course (how do you not notice that you have uploaded the wrong document for a particular class is beyond me). So, yes I got it worked out with her, and now I don't feel as terrible about me ""wasting time"". 

And everyone that is saying ""if MLA is so easy why did it take you five hours"", this paper was five pages long, single spaced and a small font (in respect to the profs paper policy). Complete with citations, headers and formatting it takes a while to make. For all of you that say MLA is easy, in comparison it is, to APA. I've never been trained to do APA, even in high school and middle school everything was MLA all day. I've been writing in this format since- fifth grade. That was   years ago so by god, I would HOPE that I know how to do it by now.

I have an entirely new appreciation for how difficult learning new material is after this experience.  With a few weeks left to go…here is what I have learned so far.

- if you are lucky enough to be going to school and just focusing on school, please take advantage of it and study/learn all you can.  I don’t have kids, but I have a full time job, freelance gigs, a boyfriend, two cats and a dog.  All these things need my attention.  I get interrupted so much while I’m sitting at the kitchen table trying to study.  I was taking a timed exam Tuesday and my dog did his “I need to poop dance” and I could not leave the computer.  He pooped on the floor and ate it.  So if you are lucky enough to not have kids or a full time job, please take advantage of this time because you will never be able to focus like this again in your life.
- I think social media has killed our attention spans.  I do not remember having this much trouble focusing when I was in college   years ago.  I have to read and reread and reread again to understand.  I was also diagnosed with ADHD in my  s so not sure if that’s part of it, but lord do I have trouble focusing and processing.  Makes me wonder how many students struggle with just reading and taking notes and taking a test.  It’s a really difficult way to learn.
- prioritize where to put your energy.  I wrote my first post because I got a   on the first test.  It is important to me to get A’s.  So I analyzed the grading break down and realized in the grand scheme, the tests don’t count for that much.  I stopped stressing so much over studying for the tests and made sure to hit every single other assignment and even though my tests continue to be in the  -  range, I have an A average in the class.

As much as I can’t wait to be done with the semester, I’m glad for this experience.  I learned a lot as a professor about things that work and don’t work.  There are some weeks where there is just too much work and I can’t get it all done.  So I do my best.  I teach a class very similar to the one I am taking and I will be revising how I teach it significantly after this experience.  Good luck on the rest of the semester to everyone who is reading this, we can do it and a break is almost here!!",2406,467,0
1615809473.0,college,"When I am discouraged about college, old replies from professors help lift my spiritsAt the end of every semester, after final grades come out and things settle a bit, I send a short email to my professors thanking them for their patience and time in teaching me. I briefly mention my favorite parts of the class, little things they did that meant a lot, and how I'll incorporate their lessons in the future. 

(I do this after final grades are released so they don't get the impression that I'm trying to kiss up to boost my grade. Also because I feel like teachers are also stressed at this time, trying to get all the students processed and grade all their exams.)

Even if their class wasn't my favorite or if I did poorly, it reminds me to count my blessings. 

Most of the time they appreciate me reaching out, extend words of encouragement, and wish me well on my journey. 

I pin these replies and save them in a folder for a rainy day. 

Last semester I experienced a rough patch that affected my academic performance. I used to be enthusiastic about school and learning in general, but for some reason even the smallest amount of reading (which is my primary and most reliable study method) required a great deal of energy to complete. My test anxiety was at its worst. I felt like my old self that desired knowledge and enjoyed college was gone. A few days ago, I was scrolling through old emails and I found a few from my former professors. Although a small gesture, their words of encouragement really helped me get out of that funk and helped renew that familiar curiosity that motivated me to pursue my degree. They believed in me, even though I didn't believe in myself. 

I just wanted to share this with all of you. You don't have to do what I did though. I hope this can help someone. Thanks for reading this far. College can be overwhelming, anxiety ridden, and stressful as it is, let alone during a pandemic which has changed so many aspects of life.

1683529839.0,college,"I’m an RA. I hate my residents more than anything.It’s finals week here at my college, I’ve been an RA for a semester and I am quitting next year. My residents have made my life absolutely miserable. I attend classes with some of them, and while they act completely fine in class, are absolute shitheads in the dorms. They just most recently called the ra on call on ME when I was talking with my friends in a common area and studying while they were studying in an adjacent room, while last night they were throwing a party and have been yelling at all hours of the morning. It’s only been   rooms who are close to each other that have seemed to pit each other all against me. I am so sick and tired of this, and while this whole situation with them has been going on, it’s not even a majority of why I’m leaving. I can’t believe how inconsiderate, grossly negligent, and irresponsible people these residents all are, and if I hear any loud noise from them I am having no warnings anymore and immediately writing them up. I hate them, I hope they hate me back because I never want to interact with them after this school year.

Edit: So this got a lot more traction that I assumed it would. Due to some confusion, here is my copy and pasted comment for further context. 

For people asking for missing context - I apologize, I got really heated last night and then passed out. I used to my friends with these residents before I became an RA for the same building I lived in last semester. At the start of this semester they pulled a fake, unmarked gun on me and pointed it at other residents of mine. After getting a heavy write up for that, they became borderline violent with their retaliation and began to scream at me nightly or when they saw me. The girlfriend of the boy who pulled the fake gun on me called me a “fucking bitch” when I was walking to a meeting and attempted to chase me down the hall. Her friends held her back. I have been more than lenient with them since this incident, because I have been worried about genuinely being shot in my dorm. I can afford not being an RA, even though it will take a huge toll on my finances. I honestly loved my job before this whole mess. It isn’t even the reason I’m leaving as well, my bosses transferred me to another area that would be a serious downgrade from my current situation and wouldn’t listen when I asked for negotiation on the area.

The same residents that I have problems with have also been arrested, drink heavily almost every night (to the point of alcohol poisoning), are incredibly racist and homophobic, and on top of that have been nearly kicked out of housing on multiple accounts.

I will fully admit that I can be hot headed towards them, but I have been dealing with them for far too long. I genuinely love my job, and I am heartbroken that I’ll be leaving some of my favorite co workers and miss out on a great training with them. I was planning on returning before I found out I would be transferring areas, but I know I wouldn’t be happy if I had transferred there.

Best of luck on finals all, I hope this provides some well needed context from my very pissed off post last night.",3168,594,0

I swear I have met so many people with degrees that don’t know much of anything. Also what really angers me is how there is no standard in colleges, each professor essentially writes their own rules. My chemistry professor made a pass/fail system  % or more on each quiz to get a point. Any lower than  % and you’d get a  %. Take the same class with a different professor, and the whole grading system is different. Go to the same class at a different college and it is taught completely differently. No standard at all.

**Tip #  Use Rate My Professor and Pick Easy Professors/Classes for Your Gen-Eds**

- this is my best advice! No need to go out of your way for a challenging class or professor especially if it’s your first year. You’re still getting used to college and no one will judge you for taking the easiest option available, especially for your gen-Ed classes where you might not ever use the information you learn again. I tend to look for professors rated  . -  stars for each of my classes and take note of them so I can register when the time comes. Taking easy classes during your early semester will help later on when you have actual difficult classes. 


- Edit: Tip #  Cont. Read reviews and find professors that teach how you learn. If you suck at essays, try not to take a professor with a bunch of essays. Same with quizzes etc. Some things you can’t avoid but different professors have different teaching styles for the same content. Find what works best for you!

**Tip #  Check Your Syllabus Weekly**

- I check my syllabus at least once a week to make sure I know what to expect for the upcoming week and make sure I didn’t miss anything. Also, I promise you all of the info you need is on your syllabus or something similar. Deadlines? Check the syllabus. Quiz? Check the syllabus. Group project? Check the syllabus! It’ll save you so much stress if you check your syllabus for the upcoming week and take note of upcoming assignments. 


**Tip #  Go to Office Hours / Tutoring (when you need it)**

- I’m not saying that you have to go to every single office hour session but if you’re struggling with a specific topic, I strongly recommend showing up. Even if you’re afraid to ask in class, you can quickly get help during office hours and feel confident that you know what to do. My professors were so kind and helpful during office hours and were glad I came for help even if it was so simple. 


**Tip #  Break Down Your Assignments Into  Specific Tasks and Write It All Down**

- I thrive on checking things off so I use a notebook (use whatever is most practical for you) and I write down every single thing I have to do to complete an assignment for the current week. Assignments can look daunting so breaking it down can help you to quickly get things done and make progress even if you don’t do it all in one go. So even if it’s just researching info before writing an essay, I like to be aware of all the necessary work needed to complete a task so I can prepare accordingly. The worst thing ever is leaving an assignment for last minute and realising it’s a lot more than you bargained for. 


**Tip #  Don’t Wait For The Right Time To Do Work**

- If you’re free now, WORK now. I don’t believe in a set schedule because things come up or change constantly. Have five minutes before you go out? Plan that essay. That’ll be five minutes less later. Class got canceled, (nap, then) catch up on stuff with the extra time. Don’t wait till it’s the perfect time or place to get work done or you’ll never get it done. Think about the time you’ll save later if you use that time now.

My professor has recently been refusing to let us see the PowerPoint during her lectures because “everyone’s just typing”. Today, she straight up started yelling at those of us who take notes and made everyone close their computers/notebooks for class, meaning no one had any notes for this extremely info-sense lecture she gave.

I really don't think a  . % and a  % are worth two different grades. It's the same amount of work. I think a grade that is so close to being upped to another letter grade should at least be able to be requested to be upped when it's in the  . - .  percents. I get this can be tough for a professor to do something like this, and some students will take a mile when you give an inch, so it's only sensible that professors stray away from bumping up their students a grade.

Basically what I'm saying is I both understand completely why a professor would refuse to do this, and why a student would ask. I think overall it's something that should be completely avoided to avoid frustration and awkwardness for both ends. I hope this makes sense. This is just my opinion.

And to the people in the replies saying ""I asked and my professor bumped me up  %!"" That's awesome! But that's also pretty rare.

Maybe I can't relate because I had a weird high school experience myself but I imagine most of you have had the same friend group since elementary school and don't know any different. 

It's not a big deal to be alone sometimes. People come and go, have different schedules, or just nothing in common. Put yourself out there and do everything you can but just starting out at college you'll honestly tie yourself down if you expect to have a ""group"" right off the bat. Your interests and whats important to you will change, for now it's perfectly normal to talk to as many people as possible and as you explore college as well as yourself some things will stick and others won't, that's just life. Don't interact with people with an expectation they'll be your best friend, relax, and enjoy getting to know others from different backgrounds.

Trust me, literally NO ONE cares if you're doing things alone sometimes. Get comfortable with yourself, because that's probably the first step to getting comfortable with others.

So I really dont know what to expect from these quizzes anymore.

Has anyone had a class like this before? How did you study?

Thanks.

I am in a minor program for a foreign at my university. I am about halfway through completing the minor but it is getting really tedious. They rarely offer my classes and the work is way more difficult and takes up more time than my major classes. I'm not sure whether to continue getting the minor or just drop it as it has taken something that I was super passionate about and made it a headache. The classes also counted towards my major as it has a foreign language requirement so it hasn't been a total loss. I just don't know if its even worth it to finish it out. I'm going to take a test next year that qualifies me to use the language in a professional setting so I'll be able to put that on my resume. Are there any real professional benefits in any of your experiences in getting a minor in a foreign language? 

Any advice is welcome as I am really split. Thanks!",1043,199,0

1708889859.0,college,"Room Lockouts and Security's Failing SystemI've had a lot of issues recently with my college and thought it was important to share.

For context, I'm a sophomore at a private school in Virginia. After two years here, I have had many issues with ResLife and it's continuing to worsen. I currently have a service animal and this is his second semester here with me. ResLife has also told me I'm required to keep him on a leash, whenever his tasks interfere with it. But that is a whole other issue.

Last fall semester, I was cleared to move in (via email) early because of my dog. I went to pickup my keycard, and was told I couldn't move in early because the worker had not received an email from the director giving me permission to move in. She refused to help me for a while, and after an hour finally agreed to make some phone calls. It took two hours for me to get into my room.

This semester, I was also cleared to move in early due to my dog. I drove halfway across the country, finally arrived at my school (after  pm on a saturday), and keyed into my room. I put my animal in my room, and went to continue moving stuff out of my car. I left my phone in my room on accident. Whenever I tried to key back into my room, it didn't work. My key card had been invalidated (I tried every door, and other people's keys worked), and my dog was stuck in my room. Normally I would call security, but I didn't have my phone. A security car was driving past, and I ran after them waving and yelling for help. They drove away. I had to break through my window in order to get in. The next morning I called security, and they told me the **only** lady who was authorized to remake key cards was not in until tomorrow. This meant my ""early"" move in became be moving in on the first day of classes, which led to a slue of other issues.

Now, I have been locked out of my room again. My key is invalidated and if I want in my room, it means calling security and waiting anywhere from   minutes to an hour. I called to be let in, and when they arrived I told the worker this is the second time this has happened to me, and we need to figure out a way for me to get my key replaced today. My service animal is currently sick, and this means potty trips every   minutes or so. Propping doors open is not an option, since you go through three doors to get outside and lots of people in and out of the halls. I was told that he would ""see what he could do"" and walked away without telling me any other information. We went back and forth for a few minutes on what supervisors need to be contacted, and who I would be hearing from.

A few minutes later I received a call from our VC, saying there is essentially nothing that can be done besides call security or her. Both of these things take \~  minutes, if I'm lucky. Overall, our security system is broken. If the one woman who is allowed to remake our cards turned up dead, they would have another security officer do it. I should be able to have my card replaced during the weekend, not just Monday-Friday  am- pm.

My parents have been supportive this whole time, they send me  $   every month for food and basic necessities and another  $   for my dorm.

This led to me looking for a part time job, just something which could give me a bit more money so I can stop worrying about it. I found a few listings, but my mum always tells me to just focus on school and don't worry about it. That I should just ask if I need more money.

But I'm tired of asking for money like some little kid, it makes me feel bad. So how can I convince my mum that I can manage a part time job with school at the same time?

1708824858.0,college,"People find a way to make every major and future career sound awful. Does it have to be awful?I’ll be starting college in August; I’m already committed to a college where I applied as an undecided major.

I applied undecided because I have broad interests and didn’t want to box myself into anything before I’ve even finished all of my high school classes. The past few months I’ve been doing some serious research into potential majors and careers, and I only see negative discussions everywhere I look.

The main career path I’ve been considering is law; but in all online spaces for lawyers and law students, they say that law school isn’t worth it and that you’ll inherently end up in hundred’s of thousands of dollars worth of debt you can never pay off, and that you’ll hate your life all through law school and for the whole duration of your legal practice.

So scratch that.

I’ve loved math classes my whole life and am taking college-level math classes in high school. Maybe I could major in math and—nope. Apparently the job market is basically nonexistent for anyone not in statistics. And even then it’s not guaranteed that you’ll make good money.

Scratch that too.

Humanities degrees are apparently all useless. I’ve seen people even say that STEM degrees outside of tech and engineering are also largely useless. And not one professional in any of the fields I’ve ever felt interest in has positive things to say.

It’s impractical to not be money obsessed even though I don’t want to be. Everyone seems to be pessimistic about college and life thereafter. And I understand why reality pushes people toward that mindset. But I have absolutely no confidence going into college that I’ll be able to commit to a subject which interests me that is also able to open doors for me to live comfortably, and balance quality of life and earning potential.

Is everything actually so bad? I don’t really have anyone in my life that has an apparent direct application between their degree and their career, and I know a lot of people in debt. It’s just really troubling.",2076,360,0

However, there has been some issues.
So there's an English class I take. The professor enjoys talking to the students. He tends to joke and banter alot but at least he's more tame with it towards me. But of course because of that, sometimes the students and will banter and tease each other as well and with the professor sometimes.
However, there's this one classmate ( f) in the course who does join in the bantering with others. However she has starting to somewhat pick on me. She seems to be the type to hide it with ""it's a joke"" but even if she was, she's not that ignorant. She could tell I feel uncomfortable around her. I did try to ignore her but it's been getting out of hand. Unlike my professor, she doesn't care when she's going too far. She seems to like getting a negative reaction from others, especially from ME.
I don't know exactly why nor do I care why because there's never a good reason to continuously do something that will make someone uncomfortable. She's literally an adult and still acting like some high school mean girl.

Yesterday, I finally spoke to my professor since he's been getting concerned with my mood shifts in class.
I told him everything. Despite me not knowing the girl's name, he does. He at least understood how I felt. He even stated how while he does enjoy the bantering and teasing in class, he will not tolerate it if it goes too far, especially if someone is getting uncomfortable. He told me that he'll do something about it and have a word with her.

I hope he means it. I could be wrong but I noticed how college seems to take bullying/harassment more seriously than middle/high school.
Even if my professor's gonna take care of it, I still wonder if there's a way to get her name, just in case she attempts on retaliating. I could try using the student portal/Canvas but my professor doesn't use it, he just emails us for class announcements and reminders. And even if I were to find a list of names in my class, I may not be able to tell who's who if most don't have any profile pictures.",2274,418,0

My thought process was that since I love CS that I'm willing to learn it on my own without financial risk and can physically prove it with my own projects; if I threw myself out of my comfort zone in Marketing that it would force me to finally learn something I desperately need (and can learn how to run my own business).

We get along well, play basketball together, go out together on the weekends, and generally just all spend a lot of time together. However, they do not do anything in terms of cleaning, and they are so inconsiderate. 

We run the dishwasher every night and every morning I return from my  :  am class, empty it, reload it, and do any other dishes. My roommates wake up before I get home, eat breakfast, leave their dishes in the sink, and then go back to bed until about noon. This leaves me to clean up their mess even though they had all the time in the world to do the dishes and clean up. 

Also, we have   bathrooms and I clean both almost weekly because they get so disgusting- also I only ever use one of them so i’m cleaning a bathroom comprised entirely of other peoples messes. We’ve lived here for a year and I’m the only one who has ever cleaned a bathroom. Trash and recycling fill up quickly, and again, aside from maybe once or twice I’m the only person who has ever taken trash out. They can be overflowing and people will just balance stuff on top.

Aside from kitchen, bathrooms, and trash, I’m also the only one who will ever sweep, vacuum, wipe down a table, clean out the fridge, anything. The thing that’s been getting to me recently though is how inconsiderate they are. I wake up the earliest out of everyone, but recently one of my roommates has been waking up around   am to work out. I’ve been woken up every day this past week to him watching Tik Toks at maximum volume in the kitchen (yes he owns airpods and just refuses to use them). Also, I’ll get home from a long day, or the gym and see the kitchen is an absolute mess, and my roommates are playing video games   feet away. I clean up everything and they don’t even bat an eye or say a word. 

Also, my roommates parents pay for  % of their things- rent, groceries, beer, new shoes, everything. I, however, pay for everything myself using money i’ve saved up from serving in a restaurant. When I buy groceries, it hurts my pockets, when they buy groceries it’s a venmo request to their parents.

But here I am, anyway.

I'm about   years, including this one, away from graduation, and I'm genuinely stuck between nothing and more nothing -- I \*know\* my interests, and what I have a passion in, but it's genuinely so hard to find those in a high-paying job. I'd just like a livable salary that would support me in brisbane (Can you tell I live in a small country town lol), or any larger city, really -- of which ensures I live both comfortably renting out an apartment, and that i can put away for future plans. (e.g. Travelling,((very much so an important aspiration of mine)), shopping, etc.)

I've just got   clue on what I want to study alongside my foreign language degree (of which will probably be German as I'm in love with Germany, it's culture and it's language, and have been for a long, long while - but I'm very, very willing and want to learn a variety of others throughout my lifetime -- mainly european. Italian, Finnish, Polish, and possibly Russian (although I doubt my ability to do so, haha.) But I'm stuck on what to pair that with as a duel degree. Teaching at a high-school or primary level doesn't appeal to me, but if that's really my smartest option, than I'm willing, but I feel as though it'd waste away my other interests.

I'm interested in history, but I feel that I'd not want to pursue a career in it. Politics, different cultures/ languages, geography and international law/european law appeals to me greatly, but at the same time nothing seems to pay well. An international relations degree spiked my interest, but I've looked into that many times it feels like, and I'm uncertain to weather I'd be able to find a concrete job post graduation.  


I probably sound like a broken record, but different cultures, languages and political relations interest me greatly, and I'd very much so like a job in relation to that...but I'm moreso focused on a high salary tbh -- my main goal is to travel.

Linguistics was an option - but again, shitty pay that could definitely NOT support me in the city. It feels like in Australia there's medical, and IT career paths, and those are your only hopes at getting decent pay.

Right now, i'm looking into computational linguistics, or doing a business/foreign language degree. Otherwise, I'm lost.

It feels like I've been searching for about   straight years, finding something that remotely interests me, and then seeing the salary/what it entails and straying away.

If anybody could suggest uni courses to combine with a foreign language degree, and the potential careers I might find myself with if i pursued studying it, or even advice, I'd greatly appreciate it. Thanks!

update  : I sent her my Word Doc version history for all   of my drafts, and an explanation as to why my writing might’ve sounded clunky. To answer the weirdo: No I did not use AI to write my essay. I’m not a good writer but I followed the rubric. I should at least have a  % or a  % or something in that range for following the rubric and turning it in on time. I wrote the essay over the course of the entire week it was due, I worked on it literally every day. I’m just not a good essay writer. I’m a script writer, and storyboard writer. Not an essay writer. I plan to escalate this if i HAVE to, but if she just accepts my proof and changes my grade, then I’ll be more than happy with that. ",2177,424,0

1708754232.0,college,"Professor knowingly slandering me to other students, affecting my reputation and career opportunities; he's guilty of other bad behavior, as well; discrimination???This guy has given me a lot of red flags over the last   semesters.  Not sure if I should try reporting him to the dean and/or file a complaint through the school's official channels, or if it might do more good to talk to a lawyer.

The TL;DR is that he's a toxic, fragile manipulator with a weird problem with autistic students who is reportedly slandering me behind my back to other students by saying things about me that he knows for a fact aren't true.  He also actively sabotoged my thesis project by privately slandering me to a vital group member, who went from being really excited to work with me to treating me abusively and almost bailing.

He's fragile about me asking questions in class, even though I do it with respect for his expertise.  He takes it all as personal attacks.  He gaslights me in front of the whole class and uses whataboutism or literally lies when called out by others.

He discriminates against the noticably autistic student, to the point where lots of us are noticing and it makes us uncomfortable.  I, myself, am a little bit on the spectrum, and I can't help but wonder about discrimination.

He plays favorites, hard.  He chooses  -  studetns per year to treat far better than the rest despite the performance of others; he emails his chosen favorites job opportunities that he doesn't tell the rest of us about; he refuses to teach the rest of us how to even find those opportunities on our own (he still makes about half his income off that type of work himself, despite being a full-time professor, so there's a very clear conflict of interest there).

I know that it's normal for professors to take a while to grade, I've had my fair share of professors that take at most   weeks to get grades in.

1708751662.0,college,"Linguistics or Crop Science?Hi! I was accepted to a program at UIUC called CS+X where it's basically like a double major but technically just one, but with content split  /  between Computer Science and something else.

I've been struggling to decide on whether Linguistics or Crop Science would be better as my ""X"". The main reason I'm thinking crop science would be better is because in case the Computer Science market is messed up and I can't get a job in tech I could still get a job in agriculture. Keep in mind all this is coming from a high school senior, these are just my assumptions and I have no idea what I'm doing :(((((

&#x B;

CS + Linguistics

\-------------------------

Pros:

\- Pretty synergistic with CompSci like with natural language processing

\- I like etymology

\- I've heard it's easier than STEM majors given that it's a humanity

Cons:- Not much going for it besides being paired up with computer science

\- If the computer science market is still oversaturated I won't be able to get a pure linguistics job

\- I don't know if UIUC has a decent linguistics program or not

&#x B;

CS + Crop Science

\-------------------------

Pros:

\- Agroecology is synergistic with computer science (not as much as linguistics)

\- Studying plants sounds cool??

\- If the CompSci market is still oversaturated I can just get a job in agriculture I guess?

\- Feels like I'm doing a real science and not just studying something man-made

\- UIUC is ranked #  in agriculture i think?

Cons:

\- Harder

\- Might get boring and tedious

\- I'm probably only getting a bachelor's which might not mean much in Crop Science",1641,285,0

She is callous, rude and unhinged, but I blame myself the very first day I met her. I asked her please I would love to have you check out this roommate agreement so that we can know how each other’s likes are and dislikes and make sure that each of us are comfortable, what do you say she immediately deflected and said no you can give that to management I have no need for that. I should’ve realized that was a red flag in itself.

Let’s fast forward to today, where I finally moved away from her after two or three police calls initiating a disorderly conduct report as well as the theft report because she stole my bag and wrote her name all over it. I had to fly all the way to San Diego get a receipt and prove that the bag was mine for them to acknowledge her theft , that’s not the worst part. The worst is management is doing very little about it until I can provide the police reports which they will be here next week but it’s just been frustrating because I have been studying taking care of a not well parent and nursing an injury for the last six months as a navy veteran, who is just trying to start over and do something meaningful so the my  life. i’ve never posted on Reddit before but I thought I would share this cute little video I created on YouTube shorts if it speaks to you please I would be happy for you to watch it and subscribe and follow the journey of escaping this awful roommate. I know he might say well. What did you do in the matter often, I tried avoiding conflict at all times. For example, if she was out in the living room, I would stay in my room. The only time I would come out is to cook, and whenever I would come out and cook is when she would start harassing me I can’t stay inside my apartment and not eat so I would avoid the general spaces so I could avoid her. She always initiated issues until I had to get the police involved. It just got to be too much. If there’s anyone who’s experiencing roommate please comment below or share a time when you had a horrible roommate and let me know how I can help you thanks for reading.

I should've known that when i decided to study there. I did not. Back in   i received an explusion letter from my university stating poor academic performance (i.e. i failed a course   times).As a record, i could not focus in the online lectures, barely cared about doing my hw correctly (even though i never skipped a single one), would not study for the exams, just shift my attention to gaming and movie-watching. I failed an exam twice in normal period, and twice in the retake exam session. In the end, I received the exclusion letter. BOOM. 

I started panicking, crying, not sleeping, having nightmares when barely sleeping, falling into depression, thinking about hurting myself, how would i tell my parents who have sacrificed everything for me to be a university student in such a prestigious university. I had   month to appeal the decision. I started wandering around the campus, asking my professor, my director, about my chances of successful appeal, since i was just struggling with that subject whereas i had barely passed the others. I started drafting the letter while at the same time following lectures + doing HW of the new semester. I'd spend   hours a day making my appeal letter as good as possible. 

&#x B;

I knew my chances of being dismissed were enough to make me think of this every single minute of the day. Letter is finished, i read it again and again, i send it   day before the deadline. Days pass, weeks pass, my mental health is worsening, but i am doing my best onto the new semester in order to show my professors i am not an irresponsible douchebag anymore. The scenarios in my head are coming and going. How will i tell my mom if i get dismissed? What will my dad do when he finds out? 

&#x B;

Roughly   days later, i get a response from the secretary while being in a lecture. It is a YES. APPEAL ACCEPTED. Professors agreed on giving me one more chance to continue my studies.I was for a day the happiest person in the world. Nothing could have described my happiness back then. I figure out for the following semester i need to sit my ass down and study the course i had to pass, otherwise if i failed it again, probably they wouldnt even give me the chance to appeal this time. New semester comes, i devote at least   hrs/day onto that course, practicing, doing exercises etc. Midterm ->  /  (  bonus points). Final ( / ). Final Grade  / .

I emailed my professor apologizing for the state of my work that I handed in and saying I am dealing with, ""physical and mental issues"" and that I will put in place ""interventions"" to focus better in class come next class. 

Is this inappropriate? I have accessibility so I believe I should be open with my professors when I feel I'm effected by my illnesses.

In accounting I did really well. It was largely self taught and independent. It was tedious, but not difficult. My grade never dropped below a  . To say I enjoyed it would be a stretch, but I managed to make it through without complaint. Once I got focused, the work went by fast, and seeing all the numbers laid out cleanly was satisfying.

As for my programming classes, they went... not so well. It was less my own ability and moreso the fact that I was heavily medicated at the time, leading to insane drowsiness, passing out in the library, and more often than not missing the bus to the tech center because of it. I never did care for it, either. I only went because I've heard all sorts of things about it being in demand. I do have a passing interest in game dev, but only for things like visual novels that don't require anything especially complex. Anyway, the little I did attend went... alright, I guess. It was certainly far more frustrating and didn't come as naturally to me. I still got an A, but that's not a big deal. 

I've always been a straight A student, even in classes I've struggled with. I've found that memorization and the drive to meet deadlines is what kept my grades high, and that my GPA does not translate to real world intelligence or the ability to perform well in a workplace environment.

As an aside, I am diagnosed autistic and agoraphobic. I have significant difficulty interacting with others, especially with strangers, especially considering that I am primarily nonverbal in real life. While I wouldn't say that a job that requires face-to-face social interaction is impossible, it would be difficult. I'd prefer something more independent, with minimal socialization (at least aloud- I have no issue talking online).

At the end of the day, though, I would say I'm much more of a humanities type than a STEM type. In an ideal world where most humanities degrees aren't seen as practically useless, I'd pursue my passion in a heartbeat. Unfortunately, college is expensive in America, and I don't have money to waste on following my dreams. Still, I sort of cling to the hope that someone will tell me it is worth pursuing my passion and that it wouldn't be completely stupid and a waste of money to study something I actually care about.

In any case, I just feel lost and confused and want to stop putting everything off. I don't know what I should do. Even if you don't have advice, I would appreciate hearing about similar experiences.

TL;DR: socially stunted autist who loves the humanities but wants to make enough money to not be homeless doesn't know what to major in because she's fucking stupid and can't decide anything for herself",3086,547,0

I'm currently in my second year, and both last year and this year, our professors in our majors consistently assign activities like roleplays and singing, which aren't really my forte given that I'm an introvert. (With only three professors teaching our major subjects at our school, we always end up having them as our professors regardless of the academic year.)

I have two sisters: one graduated in BS Tourism, and the other is currently graduating in AB Psychology. Despite this, I'm considering changing my course. However, my family, particularly my dad, is quite traditional and has always envisioned me pursuing Criminology/PNP (Which I don't Like)

Feeling uncertain about my direction due to the pandemic's impact on my self-esteem and confidence, I sought guidance from a friend (who has an experience on Counseling). I expressed my broad interests and described myself as a Jack of All Trades, Master of None. I really don't know Where i'm good at and what I want anymore. The counselor suggested considering AB Psychology as a potential option for me.

I even joked about the idea of dropping out of college, suggesting that my brain isn't wired for complex thinking. In my defense, my friend pointed out that I don't have an average IQ and might excel in the sciences. Despite such remarks, I struggle with self-doubt and worry about the consequences of changing my course.

Can I truly succeed in AB Psychology?
Should I persist in a course I dislike, unsure of my career trajectory?

**I want to start by saying I do indeed have friends.** Disparate friends from around my college that I hang out with occasionally. I know there are people here that struggle with finding even a single friend, and to those, PLEASE KEEP READING, I was in a similar spot, and I hope I can help you through sharing my experience.

So even though I do have friends, I have no friend group. That's due to the fact that my first few weeks here in uni were rough. I was an OOS student adjusting to a town I didn't know, was constantly busy shopping for things I needed, (I was out on my bike riding around alone when I wasn't in class) and had some mental hangups. I still needed to love myself for who I was, and constantly doubted anyone would care about my silly niche interests.

***It was before I learned the key to making friends isn't to be interesting, but to be interested in other people.***

I know that now, and I have zero problems making friends. I ask deep questions that really get a conversation going, listen carefully and let the other person do most of the talking. But alas, it feels like most people here cement into their friend groups during those first few weeks, when I was a hermit. And the funny part is, I DID have two orientation friend groups, TWO, but one stopped talking in the group insta chat, and seemed to split up into smaller sub-friend-groups. The other one stopped talking in the group text even though we did stuff for a week, my fault for not taking initiative and inviting people to do things that second week of school, I was still a shy, low self-esteem, poorly dressed fella.

And so, I got busy for a week, alone, and a week turned into three months, the loneliest   months of my life. So over winter break I spent literally the whole month reading books and watching videos on how to make friends.

So recently when I came back from winter break, I was determined to be social, and I was, I've been inviting people out to get food from time to time and have made new friendships here all by myself, without having to be introduced to them by someone I already know. Just by striking up a conversation in a social setting, and if it went well, I'd take em out to get lunch.

But not having a friend group where everyone knows each other is so damn hard because I NEVER get invited to do anything, I have to do all the inviting. I usually just invite someone to get lunch every now and then, but not having a group where everyone knows each other makes it so fucking exhausting man, and since I have to do all my socializing in different pieces, I can only dedicate so much time to each, rather than being able to combo it and form many deep friendships all at once. So, what do I do? I got over my self-esteem issues, I know all the rules of making friendships, dress well, treat people well, and take initiative to invite people to do things, but that doesn't change the fact that I was a hermit here during the time that mattered most, when friend groups were formed. Now I'm so socially isolated, lonely, exhausted from doing all the work, and haven't found ""my people"" what do I do?

I feel like it's a big ass ask to from a friend group where I'm the only mutual rn, everyone's already got one, and it would be much easier to inject myself into a pre-existing one. I'm just not sure what the best path forwards is for me.",3522,662,0

The thing is, we had an exam yesterday and I already know I didn’t do well. My mom has been in the hospital this week and I just couldn’t get myself to study or read the assigned textbook chapters.

When I went to leave, she stopped me to make sure I had even seen that question. 

Would it be weird of me to email or go to office hours and explain why I wasn’t as well prepared for this exam, or should I just try to do better on the next one? I don’t expect her to give me points back or anything, I just don’t want her to think I don’t care about her class or something.

1708669332.0,college,"Ungraded assigments right before midtermI need some advice regarding one of my professors. So I emailed him early last week asking about our midterm and how to best prepare, he mentioned studying the homework assignments for chapters  - . I thought, okay fair. At the time, we had submitted and received grades for Chapters   &   and I had just submitted Chapter   thinking, it would be graded by the weekend. I also asked him if the new material from Chapter   would be covered even though it wasn't part of the homework and he said it would be. I was annoyed that we hadn't had the chance to practice the new material but I was already feeling defeated. Well, the weekend came and our homework was not graded, instead, he assigned additional homework covering the rest of Chapter   but set a due date for after the midterm.

I've completed the most recent homework but the material isn't easy and there are people still working on the homework even though the midterm is tomorrow. I also have zero clue if I did it right or wrong and will have no way of knowing until after the midterm. Even if he grades it by the morning it's too late. Now, I realize I should've said something early this week expressing my concerns, but honestly, I was nervous to say anything. I have studied the material to the best of my abilities but I can't shake that I should say something anyway because I do believe that if universities are going to charge us an arm and a leg to get an education, the least they could do is have assignments graded before midterms so we can have feedback and study any material we have gaps in. I'm also shocked that this midterm is almost half our grade and we are being tested on stuff we don't even have feedback on.

Now this is where I'd like some feedback. Does this email sound okay? Should I send this before my midterm or should I wait to send a complaint after the midterm? Also, should I even complain to the professor, or should I go straight to the dean? My plan was to send this to my professor first and then escalate if needed. However, I am not sure what's appropriate here.

&#x B;

*Dear Professor \[\],*

*I am reaching out to express my concerns about the current state of the class, particularly in light of tomorrow's midterm.*

*As we approach the midterm, covering material from Chapters  ,  , and  , I have prepared for the exam to the best of my abilities. However, I am facing a challenging situation due to the ungraded homework assignments in Chapter  .*

*One of the assignments for Chapter  , which was due last week, remains ungraded. Additionally, Homework  , covering the remaining material in Chapter  , is due after the midterm. I firmly believe that receiving timely feedback on our assignments is essential to help us understand the material that we are tested on. Without this feedback, it becomes challenging for us, the students, to identify and address any gaps in our knowledge before the exam.*

*While I understand that grading is a time-consuming process, I would like to express the added stress and uncertainty caused by ungraded assignments, particularly in the proximity of a midterm that accounts for almost half of our grade.*

*While it may not be feasible to rectify the current situation, I would like to propose, if possible, assigning and providing feedback on assignments at least a week before exams in the future. This adjustment would significantly contribute to our preparation and enhance our confidence in approaching exams for this class.*

*Thank you for taking the time to address these concerns. I look forward to hearing from you.*",3616,633,0

I come from a low income household and single mother and had it not been for fafsa and a lot of work I wouldn't have been able to pay for my college. The problem arose when after winter break I had to pay for the Spring semester, as it turns out my family didn't have the money needed even for a payment plan and ultimately as I was unsure about what degree I wanted and wasn't doing super well I decided to withdraw.

&#x B;

I of course expected to still owe some money, but the amount was quite surprising. For context the semester total was basically  k, and after fafsa it was  k, which we didn't have and led me to withdraw. I moved into my dorm the  th of January and school started the day after, I submitted my withdrawal request the  nd and it didn't get approved until the  th. I was informed that I'd still owe  % of the value because I ""left the  rd week"" when really it should've been the  nd week but they waited until Friday to accept me to make it appear as me leaving the  rd week. I thought that meant  % of  k, which was not the case.

&#x B;

After I withdrew, fafsa informed me that because I left they'd revoked the scholarship, which meant my charges rose to  k, then after a few days my charges were finalized and I logged in to see that I owed  . k ( % of  k). My two points here are  . I find this amount quite excessive to charge for a   day stay. And  . Is there a way to get out of this situation? I didn't have  k to pay school and I do not have  k either, my family lives paycheck to paycheck, not to mention I've been unlucky at finding a job.

Hey, so I've never really known what i wanted to do as a kid. I always had very broad interests that spanned across all things from technology, to history, to astronomy, biology, engineering, music, etc... picking a major choice based off of ""interest"" was ridiculous to me, because there was nothing i was interested in doing for WORK for the rest of my life.

So when i graduated high school i decided the best thing would be pick a major in an engineering that seemed to interest me the most. Good money+semi-interesting and engaging major and career. I landed on civil engineering as ive always enjoyed urban planning (simcity and cities skylines haha) and its one of the most broad degrees in engineering.

However, now in my second semester i am realizing how boned i am. I barely passed Precalc with a C+ my first semester, and now im drowining in calc   with derivatives and implicit differentiaion... same story with chem, barely passed chem  , and im dying in chem  ... tools for civil is going alright but it's the only stem course im taking that i feel ""okay"" about. And even then just okay.

I dont want to play the mental health card, but theres certainly things ive been fighting there, ive been struggling with organization and keeping everything straight in my head so much that ive missed quizzes/a test and even some assignments needed before a speech for public speaking. And i have suicidal thoughts whenever i do mildly poor on anything and then they persist for weeks and weeks and make it hard to focus or do well, especially when i do poorly and it puts me into a loop. I detest the idea of going and getting ""help""  because it makes me feel weak and ineffective

Im almost certainly going to fail most if not all my courses this semester and i have no idea what to do about it. I want to drop out. Or change majors. Or take a break... but i see all my peers moving forward in their studies and careers, and i see the girl im dating moving forward in her human computer interactions studies and it just discourages me that these things come so easily to them.

Many people this past winter voiced their concerns about climate change, more specifically in regards to the lack of snow their region received. Do you think this is a direct result of climate change, or just a coincidental weather pattern? Will it end up getting worse in our lifetimes, or should we expect winter snow-conditions to return to normal? 

A recent study showed that  % of Americans found that climate change is causing harm to the quality of human life. Why isn’t this number higher? Why do we find that people struggle to acknowledge that the climate crisis is real? 

Approximately   million years ago, Earth experienced the  th mass extinction event which wiped out the dinosaurs. Now, we are observing record-high rates of extinction of many types of species, including amphibians, which may go extinct completely by the end of the century. Is there a way to stop this?

What are some of the things that the average person can do to help the climate crisis, or is there nothing at all? Do you think that it is up to the world’s biggest carbon emitters to change? 

This past year, research has found that faith in the government is at an all-time low. Do you think the government is taking beneficial measures to combat climate change, or is it a facade?

But the other thing I forgot about first year classes is that for some reason, at my institution, they seem to always have group projects. Groups in my other classes I'm taking rn (organic chemistry  , biochem) are alright because we're at a place in our academics where we've been here long enough to know to contribute and do our work. The slackers got weeded out by ochem  . 

But being put in groups with first year students... My goodness, I'd rather do it by myself. The first years procrastinate so much. Our class is at  am but got cancelled so I said ""let's just do our project during our class period since we know that we all have that time free"". Then they emailed back ""no, I wanna sleep in.

It's getting close to  pm and I've already messaged them multiple times asking where we're going to meet up and no one has replied to me. 

Hopefully at some point in their academic career (if they don't drop out), they realize that it's much better to just get shit out of the way.

1708630747.0,college,"Really frustrated, seeking guidance. TL;DR

Hello all, this is going to be a lengthy post but context is essential. As a result, I’m attempting to seek legal action against my university but I’ve never sued anyone before so I’m clueless. For confidentiality reasons the individuals involved will be renamed as follows:

Roommate - Joe

Roommate’s friend - Bob

Roommate’s super junkie friend - Gary

So Joe would bring two of his friends over. Every day they would come, smoke upstairs and stay up late into the night going in and out the house. Gary and his friend (who I later got into an altercation with) both sold drugs and did drugs. The reason I say this is because I grew up in the hood and I know certain behaviors. If you’re in and out over and over again throughout the night and day you’re either using, selling, or both. Since they offered stuff hella times that was obvious. But I noticed they looked real scruffy often and didn’t have much so then using was also obvious. Joe’s friend Bob was always in our townhouse (  total roommates including myself). 

The dude would pop in without knocking, run through to go upstairs and leave shit unlocked, he became an unofficial roommate. I spoke to all my roommates a bunch of times about boundaries, taking shit without asking, messes, etc. and nothing really changed. Flash forward a bit, one day while my nephews were over Joe knocked on my door asking for a bandage (for context I coparent with my mom to take care of the boys because my brother passed and would take them on the weekends). 

I went out, and saw a white male with his head split open (Gary). He apparently got hit by a car and stayed the night limping and also going in and out the house, he refused to go to the hospital (which is fishy and I quickly realized he was lying). The next day his family came to our dormitory asking his whereabouts, concerned for him as he was missing. 

Bob who I mentioned earlier (who I got into an altercation with) began living in the dorm. Not only was he living there, his CHILD and MOTHER of his child were in Joe’s room as well, with Joe and his friend sleeping on the couches for several days at a time. 

Bob and Joe kept taking people’s belongings such as food and more, which resulted in me just getting a mini-fridge, but then they moved on to other people’s shit.  

One of my roommates recalled Bob looking into his room while he was in the bathroom and when he asked him what he was doing he said he was “looking for an xbox controller”. 

When my nephews stayed over I was informed Bob was looking at their PlayStation while they were sleeping. There were also several times Bob and Gary would be nodding off in the living room so clearly I stopped bringing my nephews over bc of the environment. 

Then on December  th a day after my birthday, a $  Bape hoodie of mine disappeared. I asked everyone, looked everywhere, and one of my roommates and two of his friends said they saw Bob wearing it. Bob didn’t return for some time which was weird as he was consistently at the dorm since the semester started and 

Joe began giving me weird energy and ignoring me after I brought up the hoodie in our dorm group chat. 
I then did the right thing and informed my RA, he laughed a lot and said he couldn’t do anything until January because of finals but he would tell his supervisor. (For those wondering why I waited so long to report, I felt sympathy for the dudes and didn’t want them to get in trouble for being at their lowest, to me food is food and fuck it. I’ve dealt with addicts my whole life so I just saw it as people struggling). 

January would be too long and was confusing as a literal trespasser and thief could return at any moment.  I then spoke to the dean, he said that he would speak to Joe and remove him but it would take some time. 

Two weeks went by and while we were decorating a Christmas tree, Bob entered the apartment. I kindly asked him about the hoodie and if he knew it’s whereabouts because he was the only one I hadn’t asked, I wasn’t accusing him. He then attacked me and I didn’t attack him back, my roommate and I used force to push him out and he said “Stay right here, I’ll be right back” threatening me. 

I called the police and they said nothing could be done as I didn’t know his name but if I called while he was there again he could be trespassed. Afterwards for   HOURS both Joe and Bob threatened and insulted my roommate and I and claimed we “jumped him” because we both forcibly removed him. 

Joe also called me the N-word as a white male. The threats continued via message and phone call until I blocked them. I had proof, documentation, and screenshots of EVERYTHING. I brought it to my disciplinary hearing, gave it to the dean, and my innocence was proved and I was moved somewhere else. 

About a month goes by and the whole time I’ve been calling attorneys, little to no responses, and I would think I have a right to sue? Just yesterday after all the hearing had been wrapped up for some weeks, lo and behold I run into Joe and I’m under the assumption he’s been expelled, suspended, or SOMETHING. But no, he’s just back to school like nothing happened. 

Crazy thing is after the altercation transpired, my roommate and I were moved, but Joe remained on the housing the entire time (info from my other roommates). When we were moved to a dorm that nobody ever chooses because it has old plumbing, old air, and heat that does not work in the middle of the winter in NJ. It seemed like we were getting punished as the victims. 

Joe was the only white male in our household in a living space full of black and a puerto rican dude and faced no repercussions for not only saying the n-word but threatening us while doing it for HOURS. Police reports, and a whole bunch of bs collected and filed for nothing. Again, this all happened in NJ and I just want help going through with this legally. I’m tryna leave the hood and somehow bs like this follows me lol. ",5991,1109,0

1708628020.0,college,"concerning behavior from friend…Hi everyone! So over this past week one of my friends has been expressing some concerning behavior. 

I know he struggles a lot with his mental health and I totally understand that. This past week however, it seems to have escalated. 

He’s told me that he’s pretty sure he wants to drop out after this semester and has already canceled housing.

Hes struggled a bit academically (mostly just getting motivated) and has diagnosed ADHD. However that’s not the primary reason for wanting to leave. It seems like the catalyst has been the housing situation (campus shortage of rooms) and the possibility of having a roommate next semester, as he is in a private room currently. 

Although I think this reasoning is a little odd, ive been supportive. However now, it seems like he’s spiraling. 

If he drops out there will be nowhere for him to live as he doesn’t have a job and cannot move back with his family since they found out he is gay. He’s essentially fucked himself over. 

I’ve tried to provide suggestions (like talking with disability services about room accommodations since he has documentation for health issues) but it doesn’t seem like he’s willing to take advice. (perhaps self sabotage?)

He’s also been posting a lot on private stories about wanting to d*e and feeling like he has no purpose. 

I’ve been talking to him everyday and now it’s to the point im considering anonymously reporting him to our school’s counseling center. My concern is that because I’m the only person talking to him about this, he’ll realize it’s me and this could cause him to spiral worse. I just don’t know what to do. Any advice is welcome.

1708624746.0,college,"Quickest path to BA degree after LONG break  years ago I walked away from my university with only one credit left to earn my BA in Sociology. I received a work opportunity I felt I couldn't pass up and decided to delay completion of my thesis. Despite my intentions, I found myself in the workforce in a new city and new life-focus and never took the time to do it. I now have over   years in the software industry in a career where my peers typically have CIS degrees and/or an MBA. 

I was recently laid off from my job of   years and on the job hunt. I think my professional experience should be enough to ensure I land on my feet, but many job openings require a degree and automatic resume scanning may instantly disqualify my application.

So I want to see how I could go about getting a bachelor's degree in the easiest and cheapest way possible. As long at it is an accredited institution I don't think I care who grants it to me.

At the time Sociology was a great match with my youthful desire to change the world and bring down the systems that oppress us. I was a good student, but I can't say I've held onto much passion for the subject nor many memories of the coursework. And I no longer have any of my notes, papers or textbooks.

So I'm open to shifting to a different major - Business or CIS would be most relevant to my career, but I feel finishing with Sociology would be the quickest path.

So I'm thinking of pursuing a career as a radiology tech but wondering if maybe I'd be in over my head. 

My wife is going to school for nursing right now so I won't be able to start school untill she finishes the nursing program and starts working. At that point I plan to quit my job and go to school full time.

What worries me is that I haven't been in school since high school, so that'll be about   years without any schooling by the time I would start my first semester. So I fear that I'm going to struggle greatly because of this.

Also we have   young daughters. Whom of which will be in school all day while I'm studying/doing homework/ or in class. Which will be nice and give me a lot time to do those things. But I'm wondering if trying to juggle being a husband and a father to   kids while going to school full time will be too much. 

But what worries me the most is the fact that I don't consider myself to be very smart. Just very motivated.  I am motivated to do something with my life and have a career I can be proud of. I work   hour days in a machine shop right now and just can't imagine myself doing this for the next   something years. 

Here's what concerns me the most. I have a terrible memory.  It's awful.  And I'm so scared of quitting my job to go to school full time and then not be able to retain the information that I'm studying. 

  major difference will be the amount of sleep that I get. I get   hours of sleep every night now, and I think that might be playing a major role in my awful memory. Whereas once I quit my job and start school, I'll be able to get   hours of sleep every night, and I'm just hoping and praying that will make a major difference for me cognitively.

I don't have the ability to critically think, create, and contribute to meaningful discussions. I don't know how to do research either, well historical research.

The thing is though, this course was supposed to introduce me to these topics because NONE of the history classes that I've had before required me to do my own research, very rarely have I had required reading but it was often a short historical article and not three chapters from a monograph that I need to read in   days and create critical questions to discuss in class. I should have skills that I was never taught.

But besides that, I've taken a liking to language learning, particularly Spanish, and it's something I would like to major in. I had to take Spanish courses because a foreign language (up to sophomore level) is required and I fell in love with it.

The problem is, as I said, I will be giving up at the very last second, I'm in the VERY last course of this major, and that would be THREE years down the drain, my time wasted, my parents' money wasted.

I'm doing rather well in my classes, whilst juggling a part-time job, a healthy social life, and my hobbies when I have the energy for them. There's just one issue which has been plaguing me for the past month or so, maybe even a little longer: I CAN BARELY STAY AWAKE IN MY CLASSES SOMETIMES

For instance: I've already fallen asleep twice in my film class, to the point where my friend had to wake me up to prevent me from napping through the rest of the period. In my myths and poetry course, I've almost fallen asleep two or three times at this point, having another close-call today in which I just barely managed to keep my eyes open. I've also had one or two close calls in my Native American Literature course, and I've come very close to dozing off in my Sociology lecture too. 

I know people will ask questions about it, so let's review some basic details about my lifestyle: on Mondays and Wednesdays, I have to wake up fairly early in order to make it on-time to the aforementioned part-time job. ( : am on Mondays,  : am on Wednesdays.) On weekdays, I go to bed no later than  : / am, resulting in about  -  hours of sleep each weeknight (occasionally   if I'm super lucky). My diet is not the \*best,\* but I'm trying to incorporate more fruits, vegetables, etc. I'm on a few different medications which have the potential to make me feel more tired, which is probably the most important detail to mention. If I had to guess, they're certainly contributing to these tired feelings, but perhaps they're not the entire cause. 

But hey! What I'm really here for is tips on how to mask my tiredness during class. My current professors are super chill and haven't gone apeshit on me yet for being a little drowsy, but I'm worried to test their patience, cause we all have limits. Plus I don't want to appear rude and/or disinterested, because these really are courses I am invested in and enjoy, even if they have their occasional dull moments just like any other class.

I am a freshman at ASU studying finance. This semester has been a pretty shitty start for me. For starters, I was not looking forward to returning to college.

I also don’t feel like I fit in with others because I’m so socially awkward, boring, and not as street smart as the others. I isolated myself in high school from others because of this and had   friends. I feel sick of being this way now ever since end of semester one.

GPA last semester, but I’m already failing two classes this semester. I got my Math   Midterm back Friday and I failed it and it dropped my grade from a  % to a  %. Im also failing Sociology   which is an easy A+ because my dumb ass forgot to do two quizzes. My parents sometimes make me show my grades because they’re paying for my college. Even though they’re not the strictest, they still nag me. I have been yelled at for bad grades in the past though and sometimes threatened to be grounded back in  th grade and before. The day after I got my math test back, mom made me show my grades and she wasn’t mad, but she nags me to go to TA and professor office hours every week instead of tutoring hours for help. She says to go to them every time it’s available and it’s so fucking annoying. She nagged me to do the same last year when I had a great grade in math until I got annoyed. But now that I’m failing, she’s nagging me again.

When I wanted to start college, I believed that I could get a fresh start from high school and be more motivated to do things like make steps towards fully finding out which career I want and taking steps towards it and learning how to invest and shit.

1708489711.0,college,"Should I add mathematics as Major?When I entered college, I pursued a major in Engineering Physics, but I soon found myself struggling and disliking the coursework. Several factors contributed to this. Initially, I had desired to major in Mechanical Engineering, but under pressure from my father, I opted for Engineering Physics due to the reputed name of the university I got into it for. This decision created a mental block for me, for instance, every time I thought of a Physics class I was full of negative energy and anger. Additionally, the severe COVID-  lockdown in my home country meant that my first semester was entirely online, followed by a second semester with strict restrictions on campus(there was also a lockdown during the summer after my freshman year), depriving me of social interaction for nearly two years. Moreover, my high school years were devoid of much socialization, as my focus was solely on academics and extracurricular activities, therefore I was obsessed with meeting people making friends, and living a more balanced life. 

While I maintained a  .  in my freshman year, during my sophomore year, I struggled to maintain my study habits, faced a severe mental block in my physics classes, and found myself socializing excessively. I started doing badly in my physics classes(I was a good student in high school so doing badly in classes was new to me), but I did decently in my Math classes. These challenges eventually led to deep anxiety and depression, making it difficult for me to attend classes regularly during my first semester of junior year and I had to withdraw from a class due to too many absences. Eventually, I decided to switch my major from Engineering Physics to Statistics and Econometrics before the second semester of my junior year. Although I am currently in the second semester of my senior year, I have opted to extend my time in college by another semester to complete both majors.

Over the past three semesters, I have worked diligently to overcome my mental health challenges and regain my academic focus. I have also been diagnosed with a mental condition that causes obsessive tendencies, which may have contributed to my struggles earlier on(e.g. obsession with socializing or the mental block against physics). With the help of medication and therapy, I have made significant progress in managing this condition. I now find myself thriving academically, particularly in math and stats-based courses—I even enrolled in a Mathematical Modeling of Biology class and am performing well in and enjoying it. Now even when I look at my old lectures of my physics classes I can understand everything and I;m so interested in it.

Since childhood, I have harbored a passion for pursuing a career in a scientific field and absolutely hate the idea of working a job in finance or software. I also hate the idea of working a boring desk job and I've always wanted to work in research. I want to aspire to pursue a master's degree in the scientific field and maybe a Ph.D. However, I am concerned that my current majors may not align with this goal.

My situation is a little complicated. I am currently a marketing major in an accelerated program, basically just meaning my undergraduate is   years and my grad year for my mba is   year, for a total of   years of school for a bs and an mba. I realized I don't really enjoy marketing, but I do not want to waste the classes I already took as im almost done with my degree, so I was going to double major in marketing and business analytics. However   of the classes I would need for analytics would only be offered during fall of  . No summer alternatives. This is a problem because I would like to go to Tokyo in the fall of  , and the abroad program does not offer those analytics classes. There are also no other semester abroad programs in Japan other than fall  . Im currently a sophomore so if I don’t take those classes in the fall, I wont be able to do business analytics since the next fall is my grad year. I was thinking of doing my undergrad in marketing, but my grad year in business analytics as a solution. The issue is if I do my grad year in business analytics, I would have to give up the MBA for a MS in analytics. My parents are against me going abroad because a MBA is more versatile can get a more high paying job, and if I don’t go abroad I’d have a bs in both marketing and analytics, as well as the mba. However I honestly have been wanting to go to Japan for years. Not just a week or two vacation, but to live there, and experience their culture in a way that a well vacation can’t offer, even if its just a few months there. I know the smarter choice is to not go abroad, but honestly I don’t want to miss this opportunity. I’m stuck. I’m thinking of maybe going abroad, then after I graduate while working maybe do an online MBA program. I am fortunate enough that my parents are covering my tuition currently, so if I do on online MBA program after I graduate, I would be able to afford it with the income from my job.

1708480002.0,college,"Students should not have to work while in college full time I don’t know about other countries, but in the US, When you are a college student there is a general expectation that you also have a job outside of school. If you’re attending school part time, or you have an easy course load and want to work part time for extra money that’s all good and fine, but the general expectation for students to work outside of college is insane in my opinion. 

The time demand of a college student who is enrolled in  -  units (if they’re going all of the work and aiming for A’s in their classes) is generally equivalent to, or more than a full time job, which is   hours per week. The expectation is that you spend   hours outside of school studying or doing homework per unit taken. Of course a lot of students either cheat or don’t get an A in the class, but for a student who is studying to the very best of their ability, this is the expectation. So if you’re enrolled in   units it would require   hours of work outside of class plus the   hours that you are in classes that comes out to   hours per week. Now I know that’s not realistic to begin with, and most students are not spending that much time on coursework, BUT it’s safe to say that a full time student is busy with school related work at least   hours per week. 

The concept of the   hour work week was invented so that humans could have time to sleep and take care of themselves, but for some reason as college students we are expected to work jobs in addition to a full time course load. Many students have to work at least part time jobs for money and a lot of them even have to work  + hours to make ends meet. Assuming their schoolwork requires   hours per week (which is an under estimate) that means an   hour work week. I don’t think it should be this way. I think that for students enrolled in college full time, housing, food, and transportation should be subsidized. 

For students who don’t have to work, there is generally a stigma around them being unemployed. I can’t count the amount of times classmates and professors have asked what I do for work and then responded in shock when I told them I don’t work. And they even say “Must be nice” but the reality is it’s just normal and should be this way for everyone. No one acts shocked when a person working full time says they don’t have a whole other full time job, so why is this the expectation for college students? 

I’m busy probably   hours per week with schoolwork and classes. I cannot imagine having to work another   hours per week on top of that. It would require me to limit my sleep, my exercise, my self care etc to a severely unhealthy point and I have a very weak immune system so I would end up getting really sick. I sleep  -  hours a night and I get A’s in all of my classes because school is my full time job and I treat it as such. 

I think that my grades are simply a reflection of my privilege rather than my hard work since I’m competing against students who barely even have time to sleep. Many of my classmates claim to only sleep  -  hour nights, struggle to pass their classes, often miss classes and have to ask me for notes, or come to class unprepared and often look exhausted. I have multiple former classmates who have dropped out due to exhaustion and burnout. It’s so fucked up to me that this is just a general expectation for the average college student. 

Oh also not to mention we have to pay tens of thousands of dollars per year to go to college. The system is completely broken. 

Edit: Someone in the comments corrected me. It’s actually   hours of work outside of class and one hour of work in class per unit. So a person taking   units would be busy   hours per week with school related work, not  . Still with   hours of work outside of school that equals   hours per week and with   hours of work that equals   hours per week. ",3901,729,0

1708468560.0,college,"The process for getting disability accommodations is a messI'm an incoming graduate student (undecided where, but it's between   schools), and lord!!

So, I'm trying *not* to end up in the same sort of situation I dealt with in my undergrad years, but it's hard because every university's process seems to be completely different. 

In undergrad, I attended two colleges - community college and UC Berkeley. At community college, I needed some medical records listing my disability and a signed document from a provider saying I needed XYZ accommodations because of it. I met with a counselor at the disability center, got everything set up, and was good to go in a week or two. 

At Berkeley, I tried to start this process as soon as I could - so, April of the year I transferred. My documentation, come to find out, was no longer sufficient for this school and I needed to get re-evaluated for something I've been diagnosed with for   years. Fine, okay. So, I got on a waiting list for about   months and paid $  out of pocket for the evaluation (because my insurance did not deem it ""necessary"" since I'm already diagnosed). Finally got that documentation, got an appointment with my university's disability office, and got everything set up. The whole process took   months and I was without accommodations for my entire first semester and half of my second. I had to drop two classes so I didn't fail them because I *needed* those accommodations. I was on probation after that as punishment for dropping two classes, and that nearly lost me my full-ride scholarship. It was only after my disability counselor advocated for me that I got it back. I very seriously considered leaving Berkeley because of this. They expected me to simply *not be disabled*, and like, it isn't something I can choose.

The same sort of thing seems likely to happen again at one of the universities I'm considering. I'm asking if my documentation would be sufficient *before* I commit to that university so I can make an educated choice, but they can't tell me that before I commit and sign my contract. Their documentation requirements also look a little confusing. It is the most prestigious offer I've received and the most financially appealing. Considering my ability to receive accommodations there *is* the single greatest determining factor for this school, though, I don't want to take the risk that I will be left high and dry, with no accommodations, while I save up for another evaluation and languish on another waiting list. Without accommodations in undergrad those  .  semesters, I sacrificed my basic needs like sleep and food for my school work and ended up in the ER because of how hard I was pushing my body. I don't want to do that again, and I shouldn't have to. This university has nominated me for their most prestigious fellowship, meaning they do *really* want me in their department. But if they can't meet my needs, they can't meet my needs. It's just a shame that I may have to reject a fellowship and an amazing school - that would in every other way be an excellent fit - purely because I'm disabled, though. 

The other two options, while not as prestigious, financially lucrative, or great for my particular field, will accept my documentation for sure. I've asked and gotten the answers I need to make me feel confident that the transition to either program would be smooth. There would be no gamble there. But I'd prefer it if my top option could actually accommodate me and if I knew that before making the decision.

I guess what I'm irritated about is, like, why is none of this standardized? Why am I expected to shell out thousands of dollars, spend months or years on waiting lists, tank my education while I wait, and ultimately add tons of unnecessary stress to an already stressful educational undertaking, when I've done exactly that already? Why can't what works for one school work for others? Why do all their systems have to be so different? You would think I was asking for the world here and I'm not. I just want to receive the accommodations I've always received. ",4099,709,0

The Creative Technology and Design Program at CU Boulder is really what draws me to that college, it combines the logical aspects of mechanical engineering and the emotional aspect of art into a nice little degree. As far as I'm aware this is kind of a ""rare"" degree because I can't find many other collages that accurately represent the ""spirit"" of this degree. ""Our students gain an interdisciplinary education that integrates engineering, computation, creative technology, and design. Following a project-based curriculum, students learn diverse technological skills while pursuing their own unique creative goals.""

One I did find was at Mines (however it's Mines and I'm not banking on making it in), it says on its website ""The Design Engineering program rethinks the way that engineering is taught, learned and practiced. Through coursework focused on real-world design experiences, Design Engineers combine traditional and technical engineering skills with creative problem-solving techniques and design thinking to create innovative solutions to the world’s largest and most complicated problems.""

I'm not sure if that's usually offered from other schools but I thought it was interesting to share.

I have been having a really bad depressive episode following a traumatizing event.

As a result, I am struggling with concentration issues that I have never had before. I have always been able to read and memorize large chunks of texts in a few minutes, so I have never had any problems with school or put any effort in it. Suddenly, I am unable to read a couple lines without stopping, and much less memorize or understand the material. I used to write ten page papers in three hours (and get As and Bs), but now I can barely come up with a sentence on the most basic theory.

One part of me is surprised I have gotten away with doing so little for so long. Another part of me feels like I deserve it for always getting the easy way out. Overall, I feel like I am going insane. 

I also feel kind of lonely because I feel like people ""like me"" excel, not burn out and extinguish. Has anyone here gone through something like this before???

It’s ok to be one of these or even a combination of everything. We’ve all been there. You can be all of those things (lost, lazy, struggling, unmotivated) as long as you get into a trade like hairstylist, plumbing , truck driving, UPS driver or something after you get your degree. But it will also start with getting work experience of some sort. This can be through on campus jobs or jobs off campus like at your nearby warehouse. These places will take you in without a resume (Amazon,Target, FedEx, UPS), hell many of these companies have promotional tracks and programs for college graduates. This is especially for   year olds looking for their first-ever job. You don’t want a blank resume under any circumstances. Despite your parents advising you not to work during school. Not doing so will hurt you when it comes to finding internships or full time jobs after college regardless of your GPA.

I didn't really *love* science until Junior year Anatomy + Physiology and Senior year Environmental Science. I've had this bug in my brain for a few years now telling me my dream is to study environmental science and become a park ranger.

For some context, I started as a sociology/Spanish major and I *loved* it, but then I switched to Early Childhood Education thinking I was equally passionate about that. Also, sociology is *really* not the most secure career path. Turns out, I am absolutely *not* cut out to be a teacher. On paper I'm back to sociology/Spanish, but there's still time to change that. Over the last semester and a half, I went from *loving* college to absolutely dreading it, and I'm having a hard time working up my old passion for sociology. To make it a career, you need *at least* a Master's and I'm afraid I'm not ready to commit to that. But a conversation with an old sociology professor has put the idea of environmental science back in my head.

My hold ups are

 ) I think I'll love environmental science, but I also thought I would *love* education and it made me *miserable*

On the other hand, I have all of Junior/Senior year to plan and save, and it financially makes more sense to do an extra year or two of schooling now than to go back for a full four years down the road.

1708440920.0,college,"Advice about online collegeHi there. I'm currently living in Taiwan (a non-US international student) to finish my BS in Computer Science. Recently, I saw the WGU online degree program and I've been interested in it ever since. When I asked them, as it turns out, they can't accept people who don't live in the US. So here I am, wondering if there's an online program like the one WGU offered. Some things that I really like about it (and hope I can find somewhere else) are:

* Fully online
* Moves at my own pace 
* Flat fee tuition (per   months) no matter how many credits I take 
* The tuition is affordable (I hope to find something with a similar range in cost, which is around $  per   months)
* Includes highly-valued IT certifications

If there's anyone who knows any info about another university that offers similar programs, I'd appreciate it if you could share it with me. ",886,159,0

I’am in my senior year of highschool and currently choosing a career to pursue. Aside from living expenses, college is free in my country, and my parents will be helping me financially.

I got thru highschool with nice grades and did relatively well in all my classes, at first I thought I wanted to study medicine, but decided againts it this year. This means I’am back to square one and about to start sending out application forms, I have already applied to some med schools and preparing to take the exams (just in case), and a fallback school next to my hometown, so in the case I dont choose anything, I can commute from home and be relatively inexpensive to my parents. (The program there being industrial automization)

Aside from a few unmarketable and unremarkable interests I posses, there really isnt anything I would really prefer to do, otherwise I wouldnt be asking for help.

All in all, my questions to all of you would be:

What career paths would you recommend? Some good experiences with them?

What career paths should I avoid?

Any advice to aid along the journey?

The reason I have this mindset is because stereotypically college degrees that are typically viewed as boring like accounting have high paying salaries, low unemployment rates, and low underemployment. (Yes I know there are people out there who love accounting.)

But college degrees considered interesting have a stereotype of low employment, low pay, and high underemployment rates.

(Mind you there are indeed stereotypically degrees out there that pay well.)

This might come off as a childish mindset to some but seriously is the key to success in life to be bored out of your mind in school (it doesn’t help that most college students pay for it and/or go in debt for this) so you can get even more bored in future but have benefits from a job and a not terrible salary?

And on top of that, I don't participate in activities that all align with an interest such as healthcare for example.

I accepted it today, even though it was sent yesterday and found out they were cheating on our quiz. Yesterday, was the last day to take the quiz and it was a pretty simple   question quiz. If you read the book and watched the professor's lecture videos, you would have easily knew the answers. 

On the discord, they were asking for quiz answers and giving answers. Taking pictures of the quiz and uploading it to the discord. I honestly panicked and left the discord group because what if someone else reports it to the professor. Plus the professor last week had us watch a lecture video on school policies and made us take a quiz on academic integrity affirmation before we took the actual quiz. 

I'm genuinely not sure what to do. I think I normally would have just left the group and not say anything about this, but then again I never actually been in this situation before. Plus my professor made a whole lecture and quiz on this topic so it's crazy how they just said fuck it and still cheated and got the whole class involved.

1708381045.0,college,"What constitutes academic misconduct and is this worth reporting?TL;DR. Good friend has a mental breakdown a few weeks before project is due. Career advisor insists on keeping good friend's name in the project despite non-contribution and tells the group to use friend's individual submission as group submission. The group refused the career advisor's suggestion and removed good friend's name from the project too.

To set context, this was a group project involving   individuals (A, B, C, D and me). One of my project mates and close friends, A, had a mental breakdown and was warded into a mental institution a few weeks before the project is due. A has a solid track record in terms of academics and her parents expect her to remain on the dean's list.

Introducing 'E', the career and counselling advisor for A and my group. The family members of A reached out to B to inform them of her mental health condition and express wishes to maintain A's GPA for this semester. The group already has issues with dynamics for this project, with C and D not contributing to the project. Both B and I texted in the group chat, asking C and D to contribute and even allocate ""easier"" portions of the project to them. Zero response from them, but based on both of their Instagram stories, they had the time to be out partying and clubbing. At this point, the project was making decent progress with just the efforts of B and I.

B and I lamented over leaving out A, C and D's names from the project. Ultimately, we decided to cut out A's name first, and decide if we should cut C and D's names out closer to the submission date.

E starts pressuring me first to keep A's name in the project as ""she is still a student of the college"". I refused. While I do sympathize with A's mental health struggles, she did not contribute anything to the group projects. We have modified her workload by leaving her with the easier portions (summary and conclusion) and even visited her house when she told us explicitly she feels better and is ready to do the project with us. I explained that it isn't fair for B and I since we are both trying our hardest to make this project work out. We have already made reasonable concessions taking into account A's declining mental health. E calls me, and I quote, 'cold-hearted b*tch who wants to see her friend fail'. I hung up from conversation.

E realized that she is not going to convince me. She approached B, and starts pressuring her. Unfortunately, B cracks and agrees to put A's name into the document. E also starts infodumping A's personal and mental health issues to B. Subsequently, E accuses me of non-contribution to the project to B despite having zero evidence whatsoever. B gives me a heads up by sending me what E accused me of.

Introducing 'F', the professor teaching the tutorial slot for the project. Prior to my meetup with Professor F, she is already aware of A's mental health issues by E. I explained to Professor F the entire insanity of this situation. She agreed with me, also saying that it is not fair for the team if A does not contribute and we leave her name in the project.

I told B to tell E that we have already sought the advice of Professor F, and she has given us the approval to omit A's name. B informs E.

E tells B that A did contribute, and asked B and I to check our school mail for any documents by A. Both B and I did not receive any emails from A. E insisted that A did contribute, and started pressuring B again to leave A's name in the project. 

It was later revealed that A submitted the project individually.

Professor F got the entire group to meet, and hashed out all discrepancies with contribution with C and D, warning them to be more responsive and contribute or else she will get B and I to omit their names during submission.

After the meeting, I checked in with Professor F about A's individual submission for the group project. Professor F confirmed with us that A submitted the project individually, and reaffirmed her prior advice to allow our group to remove A's name from the project. When I asked if we could see A's submission to compare similarity, Professor F refused, citing potential plagiarism issues for the group if we unintentionally get influenced by A's content. She later helped us compare A's submission and our draft for the project, and reassured us that the content is completely different from the group's.

E sends B a copy of A's submitted assignment. When B asks E how she obtained A's assignment, E said she downloaded it via the submission portal. E then tells B to use A's submitted individual assignment, modify a little, and submit it as a group. B tells me of E's suggestion, and I shut down the idea completely, citing plagiarism and ethics.

It is important to note that E is also a professor. However, she is NOT teaching this particular module for this semester.

I immediately informed Professor F about E's alarming suggestion and sent her the incriminating screenshots. I also informed Professor F about E's baseless accusation about me 'not contributing' to the project. She then tells me to disregard E's instructions and she will deal with E at a later time.

At this point, C and D had contributed to the project albeit to a lesser capacity. I also informed C and D of the situation. We wrote a paragraph as a group informing E that unanimously, we will not pass off A's individual work as group effort. B then sends it to E.

E continues to harass B by infodumping more personal details of A until the semester concluded and demanding B to help A, leaving B unnecessarily distressed.

After submission, I called E with B to set the record straight:

 . I have contributed to the group project in all stages. I was the person who created the document and provided MY PERSONAL essay outline for the project to speed up the writing process.

 . I informed her that she needs to issue a formal written correction for her false accusation as this kind of accusation is taken very serious in an academic settle.

E refused to take accountability for her words, saying that:

 . She added me into a group chat and claimed I did not respond to her texts. Hence, I was ""not contributing""

I told E that if her message was that urgent, she could always drop me a text or email. However, I did not receive a single text or email from her during the alleged week that I was 'added' into the groupchat. B backed up my claim by also helping me visually double confirm that I was not added to any group chats. I checked all of my school communication platforms after the call, there was absolutely ZERO group chats I was added into by E.

 . She refuses to issue any correction because I am 'rude'. For the record, in this call with her, I stuck to only the facts and what she alleged over text. While I might have been firm to get my point across, I'm very sure anyone in my position would have used the same tone to get this very serious message across to an individual who refuses to listen. 

I tried reasoning with her on why a written correction is an appropriate response. My thought process was: ""If E accused me of non-contribution over text, then if proven untrue, it is only fair she issues a correction over text, the same mode of communication E abused to throw baseless accusations relating to my work ethics.""

Of course, that was made by constant interruption from her to the point where B had to forcefully mute E to allow me to finish.

Questions: 
 . Did E commit academic misconduct by pressuring a student (text trail as evidence is available) to take another individual's work and pass it off as group effort?

 . What recourse do I have against E for her (very clearly and reputation damaging) false accusations?

 . Is E even allowed to reveal private information of a vulnerable individual to an unrelated  rd party (ie. tutorial mates)?

Some considerations:
 . Full-ride, aiming to grad school and above. I am mindful and aware that some educational institutions may try to cover up this incident or even retaliate against me for 'seeking trouble' against a faculty member. This is an even bigger motivation to quash E's baseless claim since it also will impact my scholarship if her accusations reach management level.

 . Any grounds to even pursue action since I feel what E had suggested and done falls in the gray area of what could be defined as academic misconduct.

[EDIT]  . B is also considering reporting E for emotional harassment, but is afraid of retaliation since E has previously verbally threatened her.",8567,1531,0

I recently finished an accelerated master’s degree and wanted to see if there was anything I could do about this before paying the $ k dollars I owe to receive my diploma.

During my last two years of undergrad I was taking classes that counted towards my bachelor’s and master’s through an accelerated program. The master’s version of the course included extra assignments and a final paper. However, one semester the counselor signed me up for the regular (undergrad) version of a class, and by the time I realized it, it was too late to change it. This part I suppose is on me but I fully believed I was enrolled in the graduate version of the course for a while.

Ultimately, I did not get graduate credit for the course and would have to take an additional course to complete the master’s degree, probably costing me around $ , . I’m assuming it’s too late to be compensated for this considering I already completed both classes, it’s just frustrating that the mistake cost me time (completing an extra course for the missed credit) and money (I don’t make a lot).

1708376086.0,college,"For those who enjoy their college experience and would say they have a good, active social life, is that more from classes or clubs or parties or what, essentially if I wanted to live on/near campus and just not be in classes and only attempt to socialize, could it go well?(This was originally posted on r/OSU so just ignore any specifics on that)

This is probably a different sort of post than is normally on here, and kind of long and vague but if anyone can try and answer that would be appreciated. Basically, I have had pretty severe social anxiety since being in late elementary/early middle school, and I have finally managed to eradicate that and gain significant confidence now at  . So essentially, the last   or so years I have generally been very quiet, I have always had some friends, but ""friend"" has usually been more of a term to describe someone I'm cool with and sometimes talk to at school or work, and less of an actual friend I would regularly message or hang out with. On average throughout middle school, high school, and since graduating in  , I have only really had maybe a handful or even just   or   social sorts of things I have been invited to and gone to each year. Like countless times I've gone to extra curriculars, youth group, various things that I've almost always technically had friends in, but as far as like ""hey were all gonna get together outside of \_\_\_\_ later do you wanna come"" type stuff like rare enough that I typically have avoided getting in conversations where I can expose that I have basically no friends lol. And also have experienced that whole dynamic of like im cool with these   guys at this group, yet I talk significantly less than them and ik that they secretly or not so secretly all hang out without me lol. My main socializing since   has been with a gf that I started dating literally right after the covid lockdown my senior year, and only just broke up with in July, and by extension ""friends"" that were just her friends and their boyfriends.

Since breaking up, I have gone through an extreme phase of trying to better myself as much as possible, had a job with forced constant social interaction, have worked out basically everyday, and have gotten finally to a point where I no longer have social anxiety, I can actually just meet new people and have conversations with anyone without feeling scared, yk, like a normal person finally.

So I went to OSU in   to attempt to socialize more already, plus being near my ex that was there. However, I still was pretty insecure, no confidence, social anxiety prevailed in combination with classes and having to work way too much for it to be sustainable. I pretty much ended up doing nothing except fighting with my ex, sitting in my apartment all day being depressed skipping class and work and everything, and dropped out  nd semester with no friends or fun to show for it and a nice lil chunk of debt that I am finally almost done paying now. Essentially the goal now was/is to return to OSU with my newfound confidence and lack of social anxiety, finish my degree (still need like  -  yrs) and basically be ""that guy"" that I always have fantasized ab being and now finally can be, going up to anyone and any event and making friends and flirting and going to parties and actually enjoying college.

So the dilemma is my parents (and me to a lesser degree) really think the better move is to instead take a different career path that I am just as ok with on a base level as what I'm going for at college, but I could just take training for it and start work like now instead of having more years in school, making no money and potentially racking up more debt, all for a real ""college experience"" that they seem to think won't be worth it at all, but I highly disagree, that actually being able to socialize and be myself around lots of people of a similar age and interests for the first time in my life would be the ultimate satisfying thing possible for me right now, and as long as I saved as much as I could and got good grades it wouldn't be a bad path at all.

TLDR;

Again sorry for the length, but I guess the actual question is :

If you enjoy OSU rn and have a good social life, do you feel that being a student is necessary for that? Like if I just wasn't in classes but could go to campus, I just simply wouldn't be able to eat in dining halls, go into gyms, or obviously meet people in classes, however, I am  % sure that lots of clubs I would be interested in basically do nothing to check if you're actually a student(spikeball, disc golf, billiards, pickup soccer games etc,) plus obviously I could get into all the bars and, if invited, all the parties, plus all the random events they do at the oval, union, all the concerts, sports games, etc. like do i really even need to be a student to get a social life there?? Or is the combination of meeting people in class, then going to dining halls with them, working on school stuff, etc mainly the actual way of getting friends?",5015,921,0

The problem I have is that I am staring down the barrel of significant debt in student loans to study business economics and I don’t even know what I would do with it when I graduate. It seems practical to instead just do a coding bootcamp for the fraction of the price, just to have the certificate of completion.

I graduated from high school in  , didn’t have any plans so I decided to just take any major that my dad had suggested and enrolled in uni that same year. My plan was actually to pursue undergrad program in Culinary Management right after I dropped out because it has always been my dream to open up my own cafe bakery. 

I had intended to enroll in  , but long story short, the program was under review and they suddenly weren’t accepting new students that year as I had planned. Everything came crashing down. Not to mention a sudden downturn in my family’s finances. Considering how expensive the expenses would be for culinary school, I decided to take another gap year while waiting for my family’s financial situations to improve. That’s how I find myself where I am now. I’ve been working remotely for almost   months. Though the pay isn’t bad (enough for me considering I still live under my parents’ roof), this job doesn’t teach me any new skills.

I haven’t been particularly productive during my gap year. Before this job, I briefly worked in the culinary field (kind of), but that’s about it. I had hoped to do some volunteering or internships, but it’s quite challenging to find opportunities in my country. Almost every volunteer positions are only looking for foreigners, and internship opportunities are primarily for uni students. 

I’ve even started yo doubt my choice of major. I’m considering switching to an ICT major (either CompSci or IT), but I’m afraid i’d be too dumb for it and end up giving up halfway through again. 

I’ve been trying to find scholarships to apply for since  , but there aren’t many available for culinary students (not as many as for business, IT, or other majors at least). Now with another major in mind, I think I can find more scholarships opportunities. But when I reached out to an agency that helps with scholarship searches, they said that it might be difficult to find scholarships given that I’ll be   this year. Honestly bc of this, I’m very close to giving up. My friends are graduating next year, and here I am, clueless about my future. I feel so behind and so lost. 

What productive activities can I do that could enhance my CV? I’m concerned that my CV might not be as strong as other candidates’ when applying for scholarships. Perhaps I could take IT courses / baking workshops / learn a third language. However, some scholarships are already open for applications, and I fear I won’t have enough time to complete my courses before the deadline. :/

Additionally I’ve told him that everyone in the class is having this issue bc I have confirmed with them.

I feel really bad about this because i have spent the last   years of my life in undergrad and have not made the best use of this time at all. All i'll have to show for the last   years is a degree with a subpar GPA. I have poor grades, mostly C's , with a few B's and D's, have   work experience in any scientific/research domain, have not done any Co-oP's or internships, have no research projects or anything to my name. I''ll have nothing but a piece of paper after this entire ordeal. I had to be readmitted once and even had to take a semester off. I know no one in my position. All my friends are either working or pursuing master's programs. Every one of my peers who i started university with seem to have got their life together and fixed themselves up. Many have gotten jobs, internships, girlfriends and seem to have matured a lot in different aspecs. I just feel like a failure in this regard. I've not devoted this time to my career but have not had any girlfriends or relationships either. I wasted so much of time on worthless shit.

So i had undiagnosed ADHD and depression which i only recently diagnosed and started taking medication for. But i'm not satisfied using that as an excuse. I see people younger than me in my classes be productive and do things i wish i could have done. (Many are working in labs, projects, Ta's, internships etc). Safe to say i wasn't passionate about science or what i studied in, but it's what i got now. I do want to go for a master's eventually,but my grades are too low. I don't even know what i'd like to pursue as a career. All these feelings and repressed emotions weigh heavily on me and i'm filled with guilt and FOMO. I wasted so many years on useless social media or pursuing non constructive time wasting activites. (Partying, socializing etc.) I never became disciplined and although i've emotionally matured a lot but my skills and knowledge on how to tackle studying or life are  no better than a sophomore's. I was never like this growing up, i was talented and had a lot of potential. People always considered me smart and had high expectations from me. I never pictured myself ending up this way. All my plans got derails, i'm just wasted potential now.

im  nd year in a CS degree,not going to say im the smartest but also not the dumbest person,maybe above average.  
the problem lies with my financial issues and the degree combined makes for an unpleasant situation.  


here's some background: i've been financially struggling for the past  -  years.  
took a loan for a car,paying rent,credit cards,dental problems,insurance..etc.

started my degree last year,and got a small loan for the year(because my balance was below zeros)  
so last year i had to pay rent,loans the regular stuff plus the yearly college tuition,so my only choise was to work full time   days a week whilst trying to do a CS degree(which is a very hard task atleast for me)

this stress and overload on myself caused my girlfriend to end things with me because i didn't have time and will(and the money) to do anything.  
even though i managed financially somehow(earned around the same amount  that i pay every month)i wasn't really studying anything,i was going to lectures and trying to understand and focus but never really doing anything at home or the extra stuff you need to do to actually study,when the exam period started, i failed  /  courses on my first semester(plus the gf break up)  
on my  nd semester i thought i was doing better failed  /  courses(perhaps i got lucky)

its my  nd year,first semester of the year,and i probabbly failed already at   exams and i dont know about the next two.  
it feels really impossible for me to actually pass all of my exams and graduate this way.

i dont feel like i'm stupid or anything,but you cant ""sleep"" for the entire semester and then study  -  days for an exam and expect to pass.

if im trying to loosen up on the work hours and focus more on the studies and fail the exam anyway then it was a waste of time and money(because i'll be sinking more in debt) but if i work normally and fail the exams as well it will feel even worse(because maybe i did work a few less hours i could pull this off)  


so i'm wondering if anyone was in the same situation as me, or does anyone have any thoughtful advice on how to approach this situation,because even if i survive somehow this year,and by magic somehow i even manage to gradute,i dont really know how to even code properly,so i dont know how will i even manage to acquire a normal job,Thanks.

Before this late-in-the-day midterm, I spent the day prior and the day of studying the material. I was very familiar with it. The previous lecture the professor gave a review which covered the test material, and told us to get to the test   minutes early.

I arrived to the test   minutes early. The professor wasn't there, but the class of   twenty year olds was, and they were extremely loud and rambunctious, to the point that they maxed out my anxiety/stress. The professor came in five minutes before the test was to begin, ignoring the cacophony while I sat in silent patience waiting for the test to begin. He and his assistant passed out the tests five minutes before the test was to begin and told everyone ""Don't look at the test, or whatever. It's ughh an academic violation."" I watched as a fourth of the class started blatantly going through the test, the professor just ignoring them. I didn't look at the test and just sat there confused and stressing out, wondering if I should be getting a head start like everyone else, or if he was soon to notice someone and instantly fail them. 

He announced the official beginning of the test. I am now in peak stress from the constant noise and extreme unprofessionalism. I open the first page, to the very easiest of questions, and my mind is a complete blank mess, every nerve in my body lights to absolute max as a I realize I am too stressed to function at high math in this state.

The professor leaves the room, letting everyone know that he is administering another testing room at the same time elsewhere, and his assistant will be crossing off times on the board for a form a countdown. I proceed to get something of a grip after struggling for   or   minutes and start approaching the exam in a more forced methodical method, stress still extremely high. I keep an eye on the remaining marks on the board indicating the last   minutes of the exam. When I look up to observe there are two marks left on the board, the proctor notices, walks over to the person sitting next to me, asks to look at their watch, then proceeds to mark off both remaining marks at the same time. He announces that ""the test is over"". Then proceeds to say ""you can look at the test for five more minutes"". 

I am uninterested at looking at a ""test that is over"" and turn it in, as is, while I observe my students continue to work on the test. I leave the room.

The test results are back in less than   hours and I have a failing grade. This exam was worth  % of my final grade. 

To summarize, I am sure I would have done well on this test had a proper testing audio environment been maintained, had I made use of the ""extra   minutes"" of pretest evaluation others took and the professor allowed, and had the proctor kept track of the time properly as I had planned on using the last remaining   minutes to look over my test and reevaluate things. I am sure I would have corrected several significant issues.

I have never experienced anything like this before. What would you do in this situation? 

To be clear, I am asking if I should approach the professor, or the department head, or the dean? I am in emotional disarray, and don't trust the professor to provide a professional final testing environment. Am I just going to come off as a student complaining about a low test score?",3577,647,0

As the title says, I’m not allowed to pursue the major I want. Originally, I wanted to do something related to biology, but the scholarship I’m in (from Luwait) doesn’t allow that since I didn’t take at least three sciences in high school. I tried to convince them by saying that the university allowed it since they gave me an acceptance letter for bachelor of science, but they still forced me to major in something non-scientific. So I just ended up choosing economics since I thought that would be the safest option to take.

However, I discovered that while my major has to be non-scientific, I can major minor in anything I want. I was planning to minor in something like Microbiology while still doing my major in Economics. 

I guess my question is whether this may be a good idea to do or not. Is it possible for someone to do a master's in microbiology after doing a minor in Microbiology? Or should I just give up on this entirely and just minor in something that’s more aligned with my major?

Please be as honest as possible and just straight up tell me if this is a bad thing to do (Basically don’t sugarcoat your responses). ",1283,231,0

1708157416.0,college,"Asking for advice: Astronomy or Electrical Engineering?Hi this is my first ever reddit post (excuse me if it's not well written, english isn't my native language) or if i broke any of the rules.

I would like to ask for some college advice, well more more specifically career advice.

The situation is the following.
I'm from Chile and here (at least in my Uni, ""The University of Chile"" more especially the ""Faculty of Physical and Mathematical Sciences"") if you want to study a STEM career (Maths, Engineerings, Physics, etc) you have to go through something called ""Plan Común"" (A core program), here you learn the basics of Algebra, Calculus, Programming and Physics during two years (four semesters) at the end of it people go to their respective careers, and here comes my dilemma, i just finished the core program last year, and i am between to choices, I'll go for each in the two following paragraphs:

Option A: Electrical engineering, i failed my eletromsgnetism course last year (in the last semester) due to not managing my times correctly, (i took   extra courses, one of the was a robotics class which i loved) I took the course again this summer and i passed with good grades and felt in love when i finally understood the contents.The thing is if i am going for this option i would have very good empleabilty rates and a very good salary but studing this enginieering would take   years

Option B: Astronomy: I have love this since i was a little kid, i remember seeing cosmos (Neil's) with my dad in Nat Geo as one of my fondest memories, and in high school i to study this because the following reasons i was (and still considere myself) good at math and physics, my family is very oriented to computer sciences (both my dad and brothee are programmers) so i grew up surrounded by PCs and i program pretty well, and the last one, i feel very passionate about it. But here is the last part of the dilemma, it takes   years to study and i get a ""Licenciatura en ciencias con mención en Astronomía"" (A Bachelor of Science in Astronomy) so even if it takes less time it wouldn't actually matter since i would still have to go for postdoc studies to basically be a good scientist.

i almost forgot, here you can study freely (no cost) if you are poor enough and had good grades during high school (for getting in a good Uni) and while you are in college. So basically money is a problem if i fail a certain quantity of courses.

What should i go for? Something more stable or a dream?",2498,450,0

How do I become a better student and person?**TLDR: Freshman in college whose life-long lack of ambition and direction led me to drop out of my   year cali state school after first sem for community college, with the goal of transferring into a UC (specifically Berkeley or LA). However my mental health is crippling me and hindering my academic abilities. I'm scared it might be too late to and that I will always be stuck behind and lacking. That fear and the effects of it are pushing me towards my end** 

I never wanted or expected to live through anything in my life. Not during middle school, and definitely not in high school, but now that I have, I'm struggling to even stay alive. I was never good in school. I knew I should've placed more emphasis on it, but I could never seem to focus or retain information. I also was never taught how to study or take notes, or do things that seemed to come so naturally to everyone else. It was so discouraging that it never left me. In addition to that, the pandemic which hit during the last half of my freshman year of HS made me so chronically online and used to rotting every day that it stayed that way. I know I sound pathetic admitting that, but its true. My new bad habits, added onto my already lackluster efforts in school and preexisting mental health issues, crippled me. I only did enough to get average passing grades, even cheating a few times when needed. My small, underfunded out of state military school made me feel very underprepared academically and lacked a lot of opportunities and resources other students may have had at theirs. Or maybe I'm just trying to cope and it really is all just my fault. I don't remember any math or science from HS, which is a huge part of my anxiety because I fear I won't be able to be successful at a top school or get a good job after college without being good at those skills. I've never had any consistent hobbies or extracurriculars because for some reason I would always get bored and have never enjoyed them. Finished my first semester at my CSU with only a  .  and gave up my dreams of being a nurse/doctor because I feel too dumb, changed my field of study  x and still don't know what I want to be or what I CAN be after college (though I've settled on studying philosophy and psychology). I feel so unable and lost. A failure, and like a shell of a person because I've let my bad habits and bad mental state make me so unaccomplished. I don't know what to do or why my feelings are consuming me entirely. My anxiety is so bad I'm too scared to even open my laptop and look at course content or do homework.

i understand the concept of academic papers and ""arguments"" but i just can't really wrap my head around where these arguments originate or how subjective they actually are

(and how can you ever be sure your thesis is ""novel""? can you really know if NO ONE has ever said it before???)

and i'm a massively awkward incurable introvert so i really have no clue how to ""network"" with my professors and figure out what kind of stuff they're working on in the interest of asking to get involved myself. for instance one of my professors regularly visits archaeological digs. another is in the research phase of writing a book. i don't know if those are their primary academic projects with the university that undergrads could even get involved in or what.

I find myself in a bit of a dilemma and could use some guidance on a legal matter. I have recently been offered a withhold of adjudication on several drug-related felonies. My primary concern is how this might impact my eligibility for FAFSA's Pell Grant.

I'm currently debating whether to take this case to trial, as there's a slim chance it might still allow me to pursue a military career. On the other hand, if a withhold of adjudication enables me to attend college, it might be a more practical decision, considering my financial situation.

Has anyone here faced a similar situation or has knowledge about how a withhold of adjudication on drug-related felonies may affect FAFSA eligibility?

I used to work at a shelter in foster care/ animal admissions department and I've also loved animals my whole life and have always wanted to work with them but working at a shelter just really enforced that goal in me. 

My goal is to either work at a zoo with various animals, a big cat sanctuary, or a regular shelter with either just cats or cats/dogs. I would prefer to work in a zoo that's my main goal but shelter work is my fall back plan. 

My only issue is I have no Idea what to pursue educational wise like what classes/courses needed to be taken or anything like that. 

I'm also not super keen on the medical side of things, I'm not against it, it's just not my first choice (even though ive been told i have a knack for it). I prefer to work closely with animals interacting with them daily and forming close bonds. 

What area/specialty would yall suggest for me and and idea of what classes/courses should I take to achieve this goal?

I'm ( F) final year university student currently busy with my postgrad studies. Since my first year of uni, it's been a routine for me to go home every single weekend, especially given that I live in the dorms about   min away. The problem is that if I don't go home, my parents will be spending the entire weekend alone and having no one. They have been divorced for over   years and neither of them has moved on or enjoys going out much despite them not liking being alone. I'm particularly worried about my dad. 

It's only been a week since I moved back to the dorms and I already feel guilty about telling them that I won't be coming home this weekend. I feel like I don't have much time for myself if I keep going home every weekend. The constant packing, going to mom's for the first night and then packing again to head to my dad's until the Sunday is a lot for me. And I cannot just be in my room during the weekend because I am expected to be with them. Sometimes it feels like I should be their companions.

1708117028.0,college,"Parents who pay their child’s college: will you not pay for certain majors?I had this discussion with one of my friends who went to college for film and I want to know your opinions.

Years ago when I headed off to college, my parents told me they were going to be paying my college tuition (lucky me!). 

However, they wouldn’t just pay for any major. They gave me a list of majors they would pay for, and a list of majors they would not pay for. Notice the wording there: if I want to go to college for something else, I’m free to do so. They just won’t pay for it.



The list of majors they would pay for included but not limited to:

Electrical engineering

Computer engineering 

Mechanical engineering 

Civil engineering 

Chemical engineering 

Computer science

Nursing

Economics

Finance

Accounting

Biology

Business administration 

Information technology.

To summarize, it was almost any college major that was a bachelors in science or something business related.

On the other hand, these are majors they would not pay for:

History

Film

Anthropology

Political science 

Anything else with “art” in the title.

Their reasoning? They went to the bureau of labor statistics and looked up the average student loan debt for each major. Then they looked up how long it would take to pay off my student loans given a certain college major. Every major that would take less than   years to pay off with an entry-level salary in that field they would pay for. Everything they wouldn’t pay for would take more than   years to pay off.


Luckily this wasn’t a problem for me at all. I had already decided as early as middle school I wanted to be an electrical engineer. My sister ended up choosing biology. 


Meanwhile two friends from college went to school for film. After graduation One of them works at a consignment store and the other drives patients around at a local hospital. I have moved out of my parents house and now live independently. My friends who went to college for a liberal arts major can’t afford to do so. 

There are good arguments for why you should pay for your child’s college regardless of their major. Such as you will never get the “college experience” again in your life. But I don’t know if I buy this because my college experience consisted of playing video games and going to Walmart with my friends (rural college). I could do that as an adult.


On the other hand there are very good arguments to this approach my parents used, and the proof is in the real world: I moved out of my parents house and pay all my own bills. My friends cannot afford to do so. The purpose of going to college is to make more money. College is too expensive of an investment to simply go for the purpose of partying for four years and learning for the sake of learning.


But what do you think? Would you pay to send your kid to college even though you knew they couldn’t afford to leave after they graduated? Or would you be like my parents and only pay for degrees that ensure you could afford to live independently? This isn’t something I have to think about immediately, but it does apply in the future if I choose to start a family.",3165,563,0

1708110516.0,college," , turbulent, and environmentally inclinedI (F ) have been floundering academically ever since I graduated high school. I'll try to summarize. 

I took dual enrollment and AP courses during school, a great opportunity and privilege, but rather than labbing with different subjects to figure out what could get me a job (let alone ignite some mf'ing PASSION into me), it left me feeling like credits are a grind to get through rather than interact with. I graduated high school, and immediately went to undergrad for a year, remaining undeclared. I was miserable. Not knowing my purpose prevented any confidence, and I did not feel like I could academically discover myself after classes went online. I then took a gap during the peak  . -  years of covid, where I volunteered at animal shelters and worked minimum wage to survive, seeing friends and family rarely. I wrote a ton, and read only enough. I went camping by myself throughout each season. I was hoping to explore life more as a  -year-old, but covid prevented my few ideas. I lived alone, losing so much of my sociability and motivation. After awhile, realizing that repetitive labor gave me room to understand I'm not utilizing my brain in the way it needs to be (nor was I even considering a future, being so depressed), I decided to return to college once it remained offline. 

With all of the identity disturbances and social science credits completed in high school, I returned to a different school (one of the big  , for context) studying biopsychology (AHHH). My constant turmoil between ""picking something with job prospects"" and ""picking something that's interesting"" has caused me to remain stuck in a pile of glue, somehow landing on a major that provides neither. 

What’s wacky is that I’m basically done with my degree, however I’m realizing that earth/environmental science/ecology/wildlife is where my innate curiosities have always been. I know that an environmental science degree won’t grant me immediate employment, either, and that adding on another year or two will not be a financially sound move (and I already haven’t been financially literate by starting college before I knew what for). I’m too flippant in my interests and am fearful of making a costly mistake, but this has paralyzed me on my gap and I don’t want to remain stagnant forever.

To further flirt with my fleeting enthusiasm, for the past few months I’ve been volunteering at the local science center where I handle the reptile and raptor exhibits. It’s the highlight of my week. I became president of the entomology club at my school as well, but I know neither of these are laboratory experiences that show my understanding of the fundamentals of core science. To graduate next year, I only need a couple more psychology classes, so I have room in my schedule for some evolutionary biology or geology courses. I haven’t quite limited what I want to do in the environment or with creatures, which I know is an issue regardless of if I have the degree or not. I’ve been accepted into some geological research camps that offer quite a bit of course credit, but will also cost a couple pennies to do.

All I ask for is some input. Do I reach out to labs in hopes to gain some experience before I graduate in  ? Do I add a double major, and spend another few thousand towards university? What classes should I add to my schedule next year as masters prerequisites? What do I do to get into the environmental scene after college if I have an irrelevant degree?

TLDR: I returned to college after a gap year to study Psychology but do not want a counseling or social work career, and am realizing I have a passion for environmental science/ecology/evolutionary biology.

I’m ( F) a nontraditional student who just started school again last semester to finish my biology degree. For the most part, it’s been going very well. I have a  .  GPA and I’m working part-time in a lab I enjoy. I got all A’s last semester and have A’s in most of my classes this semester. The problem is with chemistry.

At my college, there’s a chemistry class that counts towards the biology major, and then a basic chemistry course below that one that doesn’t count. You can take the basic chem course if you didn’t take chemistry in high school/didn’t test into the major-level chemistry. When I was in college the first time, I tested into the major-level chem course, so I that’s the one I signed up for this semester.

I thought I’d be okay in this course but I was wrong. It’s been a decade since I took chemistry in high school, and I’ve found that I don’t remember nearly as much as I thought. I feel lost all the time. I’ve gone to office hours and that’s helped a bit, but despite that, the knowledge gap is huge. I studied a ton for the first exam and still failed it. I can try, but I'm not confident that I can catch up fast enough in chemistry to save my grade at this point. I'm very embarrassed that I put myself in this situation.

I met with my advisor and he recommended that I drop the major-level chemistry, take a self-paced refresher course for the rest of the semester, and then take it with a higher-rated professor over the summer. (Taking the basic chem course next fall isn't an option since it'd delay my graduation by a year.)

I’m strongly considering going with what my advisor recommended and think I’d do well with this option, but I’m concerned about adding another W on my transcript. I’m hoping to go to grad school after I graduate, and I don’t want this W to potentially hurt my chances at being admitted since I have quite a few Ws already. Back when I was originally in college, I was dealing with some serious traumatic events that impacted my ability to focus on school. I had a scholarship that I would have lost if I dropped out, and my family told me I’d never go back if I left, so I continued on despite everything. This didn’t work out so well, and as a result, I have a few semester’s worth of W’s. Looking back, I really wish I would have taken a pause in my education much earlier, but I realize that I can’t change the past and can only move forward.

My question is: do you think it’d be wise to take the W at this point, and would it hurt my chances at being admitted to grad school?

I don't want to be an asshole, but she's over here every single night, and I feel like it's unfair that she gets to stay here every night while me and her boyfriend are the ones paying for the suite. I wouldn't have a problem if it was a few times a week, but every night is too much. I should have done a room change when I had the chance, but I was worried about ending up with even worse roommates.

I know I'm FAR from a great roommate myself, but how do I handle this conversation? I feel like it would be beneficial for me and my roommate to air out grievances, but we're both quite introverted and awkward.

I am a   year old student getting a bachelors degree in Applied Education: Learning Design and Technology.

After I get my masters, what will a job outlook look like for me? Do you think I could get a job teaching English/Some kind of literature speacility at a community college level?

 I am also interested in implementing cultural events at museums, schools, universities, and libries.

I am going to be slightly vague with some details because let's be real.....we have $ ,  wrapped up into this school with a few months until graduation. Don't want to ruffle the feathers too hard until the diplomas are in hand. Here's the story....

My fiancé and I moved out of state so she could attend a medical program at what seemed like a great community college. I am able to work from anywhere and were looking for a new adventure hence why we did this journey. The college ,like most I would assume, sold us on the low cost of the program, excellent staff, blah blah blah. Almost two years into this and we are both so frustrated. My fiancé and many other students are thousands over what the original estimated costs would be. We are more concerned though it would seem as we have been paying most of the costs out of our own pockets. Most of the classmates are younger and have their parents simply footing the bill. If the parents knew what they were actually paying for, I think they would be livid. Since the program has started, students have been required to purchase their own medical instruments which will most likely be never used again as the future employers provide them. The cost of the instruments ended up being over  ,  dollars from the original quote. Professors basically shrugged and said, ""sorry....inflation🤷🏻‍♂️"". Then on top of the ""class fees"" which were not broken down, were charged new software fees, are forced to ""volunteer"" to raise money for the program, had to buy testing software from a specific company even though there was free open sourced software readily available (im assuming professors are getting a kickback, and for the cherry on top, the program is charging a ""site fee"" to take the upcoming boards of $  per students and yet the site is RIGHT HERE AT THE SCHOOL. It's OUR school. Most of these costs have been piled on during the second year of the program so there's not really any backing out. The entire class wrote a professional letter to the program director stating cost concerns and she basically replied with ""sorry, the document you signed said school costs were only an estimate. If you do not like it, you can leave."" She is the same director that claims she searches for grants all day to find funding for the program. A program that just had a brand new multi-million dollar building built that it seems we are all footing the bill for.

So with that said, what do we do? I feel the program needs to be audited but by who? I feel that I can not take it directly to the school is the employee moral here is dirt. Theirs is no accountability, no happiness amongst them, and I imagine if I bring concerns like this to them or a board meeting, I will be met with issues. We definitely do not want to risk everything that my fiancé has worked for.

I have reached out to the states department of education who referred me to the states community college board. Have called the board multiple times with never a call back:(

If a student chooses to take a chance and raise their hand in response to your question, do not **ever** make them feel regret for having done so. Time and again I have seen teachers shut students down in a disrespectful manner, then complain that people don’t raise hands enough during class discussions. 

The best lecturers I’ve had will **always** compliment and thank students for active participation. Many people will never again raise their hands after being embarrassed, and their peers will avoid trying altogether out of fear of receiving the same treatment.

Aside from that, the food windows, especially for breakfast are so ass and the caf is so gross (has rats and all types of bugs), that it’s hard to eat breakfast and feels like I have to allocate my time to them instead of it being allocated towards me DESPITE paying thousands for an education. 

Anyway, the math class is  am. I had another math class in the first semester that was  am but this time, for some reason,  nd semester classes in general have been kicking my ass a bit and this  am isn’t helping. For the life of me, I can’t seem to wake myself up, despite setting many alarms and putting my phone way across the room from me. If I do the latter, I’ll think I have some time to get some extra sleep in and then I end up missing the class entirely. 

I know, in a way, it’s my sleep schedule dle as I stay up till like  am but I somehow always wake up at  - , still tired, but awake enough to function which sucks bc class ends, but good, because it’s not entirely late. It’s like this school expects you to have a full wake up at  am and go to sleep at  pm. 

Thankfully, my math teacher is really chill so she doesn’t mind lateness, but I’m not late, I’m just straight up missing class.  nd semester just started and I feel like I’m doing so poorly. This week was the first I missed both classes (have one Tuesday and Thursday). Yes, the obvious answer is get more sleep, and sleep early, I know, but every Monday, Wednesday, and Sunday, I have rehearsal for a show I’m in from  - pm and I get home around  - :  and my classes on Thursday and Tuesday don’t end until  pm so sometimes I study for like  -  hours before rehearsal or until I’m finished whatever I need to do, then have my free time. I can’t drop the class because the add/drop period is over and I really don’t want to withdraw but this is ridiculous and I don’t want to miss anymore classes. 

Do you guys have any tips or ideas on what to do in my situation? I remember that guy saying how he loovvved  ams and I wanted to slap him in the face lol, I hate it.",2548,492,0
1708012328.0,college,"Is TCSPP a respected institution?Hello, 

I finished my B.A. in Psychology through Maryville University (online) in   and had a great experience. I’ve since been trying to get into a masters program for clinical mental health counseling, either in person or online, and I’ve had a hard time and have been met with many rejections. 
I recently applied to The Chicago School of Professional Psychology for their (online) M.A. in clinical mental health counseling and the process was almost too easy. 
The recruitment advisor was nice but I could tell she was always reading straight off a script. And I didn’t like the fact that they don’t offer any sort of financial help through their institution - she just kept repeating that their faculty are great and practice actively as therapists. Which is great. But I feel like that is the bare minimum for any program like this? 
They are also significantly higher priced than other programs I’ve been looking at. Including in person programs here in the state of TX. 
I like that they are CACREP accredited and their program meets TX state licensure requirements.
I started to look for some online reviews about the school and program. 
Overall I did not see a anything good. 
I was wondering if anyone has actually attended this specific program? Or has a degree through them? 
Is your degree recognized/respected by employers? What was your takeaway on the program or faculty/overall experience? 
I have an admissions interview tomorrow and I just want to know if this is going to be worth my time and money. 
Hopefully I find scholarship help wherever I end up - but ultimately I will have to take out loans to go back and finish school. I’ve already been out of school for over a year and I’m ready to go back and get my final degree over with so I can kickstart my dream career.",1828,317,0

I'm a graduate student in Cybersecurity with a non-technical background in liberal arts. Currently, I'm in my second quarter, taking introductory courses in Data Structures & Computer Systems. Many of my classmates are also from non-tech backgrounds. My interest in computers and technology developed during a gap year after my undergrad, leading me to pursue cybersecurity.

While I maintained a solid GPA during my undergrad, I faced challenges to reach that point. Although I performed well in my initial cyber intro courses, this quarter has been unexpectedly difficult. Despite having coped with difficult professors in the past, the intensity of my current classes is unparalleled. To put it into perspective, I never scored below a B in undergrad, even when prioritizing harder courses over other courses. However, this quarter, I've received grades as low as   and   on quizzes, and I fear I may have failed a midterm. Another midterm is looming, adding to my anxiety.

I've never had to retake a class before, but stories of previous classes failing and having to repeat them concern me greatly, both in terms of time and money. I've reached out to one of my professors to seek assistance during office hours, although I'm unsure if it will make a difference.

1707948542.0,college,"Should I bring up my roommate's alcohol use to her?Throwaway account because my main account is easily identifiable.  I am currently a junior in college and I share an apartment with one of my best friends here and two girls who we aren't as close with.  Lately, I've been noticing some concerning patterns with my friend/roommate's alcohol use.  The two of us share a friend group that goes out  - x per month and does weekly movie nights/kickbacks where we drink a bit and I've been known to occasionally have a few while watching movies/documentaries on my own, so it's not like I'm being puritanical about this.  Her drinking habits have just raised several red flags for me lately, and I'm wondering if I should bring it up to her/how I should do so. Some examples that have concerned me are as follows:

\- We started out the year with about a half-full  . L handle of vodka that we shared (I had it leftover from the summer).  I had exactly   shots of it as a pregame one time and the rest was drunk by her within the first month-ish of the semester, along with a second  . L bottle that she bought and mostly finished before winter break.  I know for a fact she was drinking it alone because she and I share the same friends and she isn't close with anybody else enough to have them over/go out with them (the rest of our core ""group"" of   has other friends from our classes that we'll occasionally go out with and therefore not hang out as a group for a week or two, but she's more antisocial and really only talks to the   of us.  She's even expressed animosity towards the idea when I've suggested making other friends so she has other options when our group isn't hanging out)

\- She's now onto her  rd?  th?  . L bottle of vodka for the school year and there's probably only one shot left in it, not sure how long she's had it.

\- Last week alone there were around   empty cans in our recycling, several of which were tall boys.  I know they were hers, not our other roommates', because I saw her bringing the cases in the week prior.

\- I see the worst of it because I live with her, but two of our mutual friends have reached out to me to ask me about her drinking because the patterns spill into her life outside our apartment (i.e. while the rest of us will be quite drunk and having a good time, we can still get home safely and be aware of our surroundings, while she'll need help getting home and we've considered calling an ambulance for her before because she's so drunk).  We'll encourage her to slow down/drink water at the pregame/when we're out because we know she's prone to drink more quickly than the rest of us, but she doesn't always listen.

\- She also texts the groupchat about being drunk when she's home a lot more than the rest of us will.  I.e. ""oh my goodness my sister and I pregamed this lazer tag too hard I feel like I'm gonna puke haha"", and it seems like all she does at home is pregame things that don't need pregaming with her sister and her home friends, and then texts me or the group to tell us about it.  I can also tell she's drunk and not exaggerating because the sentences are more incoherent than usual.

\- I checked the level of her vodka bottle monday morning and monday afternoon (maybe I'm snooping a bit too hard at this point, idrc) and she had to have had at least  -  shots in the time I was on campus (roughly  am- pm).  I was starting to convince myself that I was overreacting to this whole thing, but I really don't think I am.

\- She also drinks a lottt more when her boyfriend is here (he goes to another college) and he usually doesn't drink at all which is a whole other can of worms I don't want to open.

All in all, I'm really worried for her.  A lot of other stuff has been happening in her life and I've been a listening ear to her complaints and rants about it, and I try to be supportive, but I feel like without saying anything about the elephant in the room, I can't fully be there for her the way I want to.  Does anyone have any experience with something similar?  I don't want to make things awkward or make it a confrontational event as we're living together for the rest of this year and next, but I am also extremely concerned by this behavior and want to make it known to her that I'm available if she needs/wants to talk about it.

Now in general I see myself working with computers for a long time because I genuinely like tech but I’ve realized that I can tolerate coding, but don’t necessarily love it. I would rather have a balance in coding so any role like r/devops or r/sre that mixes IT and coding together. So I’m not coding all day long for typical activities. 

When I’m in class I’m not enjoying relearning the same concepts again. The only recent class that stimulated me was a statistics course that I took and enjoyed using R and python to make data look pretty. I also have done r/homelab projects in the past that were interesting and fun to complete

So now… there is a major that I can switch to possibly that has my interest. And that major is Computational and Data Science (CDS) and it seems as if like a cousin of CS with the main focus being centered around data science, not sure how much coding is required in the major but if I switch would have about   credits,   semesters left to graduate and I can take courses online.

1707938136.0,college,"Would it be rude to email my professor about this?TLDR: I’m wondering if it would be rude to email my tech professor and let her know how to force mute members on Zoom because of the continuous disruptions.

I’m taking a digital tech class (the actual name isn’t important since the professor only teaches tech related classes) online and we only have one Zoom meeting per week. The professor is super nice, but, this is her first time using zoom to teach and she doesn’t know how to use it (ironically). I know for a fact she doesn’t  % know how to work it because she told us that the first week of class. 

Anyways, the class is only   and  / hrs long. Every single week, there’s two students who are continuously disruptive (asking the professor irrelevant personal questions like what her favorite genre of music is?? Etc.) but whatever I don’t think that’s my place to call them out and it’s a good opportunity to practice my deep breathing exercises anyway. 

My problem is that MULTIPLE times per class they unmute themselves and my professor has to wait for a pause of silence to tell them to mute themselves. Last week, for example, one of them was unmuted and was listening to a completely different lecture. So, we all had to wait for about   minutes and listen to this guys other class because it was so loud the professor couldn’t tell him to turn his mic off. Not to mention there is the occasional accidentally unmute from other members (usually not very disruptive). It’s to the point where we’ve actually run out of time to cover content because of the disruptions. 

So, my question is would it be rude/inappropriate to email my professor and let her know that she can force mute people so we don’t have to keep wasting time? I don’t want her to think I’m telling her how to teach her class and I don’t want to offend her (especially because it’s directly related to the courses she teaches!!)

I just went back to college after winter break, and talked with my ex about something we texted during winter break, which was about us. In the end we both decided to stop talking for a while since we both needed some distance, which started no contact between us. I talked to one of my roommates about it, lets call him Joe. Joe got along with my ex but nothing more than that, since they didn't hang out. The moment I talked to Joe about my situation he called her a bitch for what she did, which surprised me and I didn't think was right, since my ex and I ended mutually and never have spoken bad about her.

It turns out that right after we broke up, Joe and my ex started hanging out a lot. This really pissed me off, especially since I was moving on. I ended up distancing myself from Joe to work on myself after said breakup, which really helped me feel better and moving on from my ex, I even ended up making new friends and getting out of my comfort zone. I think that Joe saw this as something bad, and every time try I would start to strike up a conversation with him he would say things like ""no one gives a fuck"" or ""no one cares"", even if i was having a conversation with someone else and he was in the corner of the room.

Then his birthday came up, and he was planning on getting together with all of us and his friends in our college dorm. He asked me if he could invite my ex, and I straight up told him ""no"", and that ""it really fucks me up that they both hangout when i am trying to move on"", he understood and was cool with it. When the time came, I saw that nothing was done for the party, it turns out that he kind of expected everyone to get the stuff for him, which is why no one showed up in the end, and ended hanging out in another friend's college dorm.

Its effecting my quality of life and the things i need to get done. I'll start off with im a   y/o male, work full time as a assistant manager at KFC and take   College Classes. I started having alot of these issues back in september of  . In May of that year, i had ended a long term friendship with a woman who i had alot of strong feelings for and i was really hurt by it and i can admit almost a year later its still on my mind today.   


Main issue im struggling with is that i have an incredibly hard time with getting going for the day. I dont get up early and eat breakfast, comb my hair, brush my teeth, etc. I literally get up last second for work/school, get dressed and leave. For work and school i have to leave the house around  , i usually get up at  : . I try to get up early; i set multiple alarms and i set my smart light in my room to turn on early to force myself to wake up, but i just end up rolling over back to sleep.   


Then outside my waking up habits, ive struggled alot to be productive and get things done, like school work. Alot of times when i get home from school and work, i should be getting work done but instead i go into my bed, immediately knock out and either take anywhere from a   minute to a   hour nap and i waking up feeling super fatigued and just unable to get anything done. My days off from work and school, I have an even worse time getting up, i wake up around  - am but keep trying to roll over and fall asleep again so i never get up  until  ish. then i literally just stay in bed watching videos on my phone.   


The last thing i would like to talk about is when im actually getting school work done. When im doing school work i really have a hard time focusing, i tend to get anxious and stressed or even distracted by anything while doing school work. Which all of that makes me lose alot of my motivation and i just feel shitty about myself.

I know this is alot. I personally feel like im dealing with depression and anxiety and im trying to go to the doctor but its hard right now to get an appointment set up. I know alot of this might sound like im ""lazy"" and ""unmotivated"" which maybe my motivation isnt  % there but i do want to be successful in my college career, i want to complete all my work and get the best grades i can to impress my professors and future employers but im really just struggling to overcome alot of issues in my way.

Ever since around Senior year of high school, I've wanted to major in Social Work and become an advocate. So that's the major I came in declaring. But, I'm taking my first class surrounding this major, and I'm bored as hell, and I'm not sure I'd be able to separate my work and home life to the appropriate extent needed for this job.

But now that I'm taking classes, I had to take a lab course for my prerequisites and for my gen eds. And this semester ( nd week in), I'm taking an Intro to Biological/Physical Anthropology course. And my God, my inner child is so happy, and I'm actually excited to learn about this, in particular the Forensic Anthropology. 

The only thing is, to be a Forensic Anthropologist you have to go on to get a PhD. A little background, my parents don't make enough to help me through college, but they make enough for the FAFSA to not give me a whole lot. So what loans I do get, I will have to pay back on my own. 

So I don't know what to do. Do I stay in the major that I know and only needs a bachelor's, but be bored and potentially burn out of Social Work anyway, or do I stay in school for another   years and rack up hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt?",1344,257,0

The course is enjoyable because until now, I have taken all of my lab-based sciences online. I finally get to work in a physical lab environment. However, it is not what I was hoping for. 

My group rarely talks and collaborates with one another. We are a group, yet we do not work together. When working in a group, especially in a lab, I want us all checking in with each other to ensure we know what we're doing. There's none of that! There's always some weird tension in our group. Rarely anyone speaks up or takes the lead.

I'm not sure if it's because my group doesn't understand what we're doing, or because they do but want to keep to themselves. And most of the time, I feel excluded, confused, and misled. Everyone has their belongings on the table, but there isn't enough space for me to work with them. I have tried hinting it to them, but no one moves. I’m always the last one to finish because of it. Furthermore, when I communicate with my group that I need help or do not understand the procedure, barely anyone responds. Willingly anyway. I'd have to ask my professor or reread the steps, which does not help much.

Furthermore, when it comes to results day, hardly anyone discusses their analysis of the experiments or their answers to the ""mastering concepts"" questions from the lab book. Even when they do, I am rarely included. I'd have to either fill in the blanks myself or get the answers from the other group. As I previously stated, we are in a group, but we do not collaborate. I might as well be working alone.

1707857054.0,college,"How can I deal with being different?Hello everyone, 

first of all, sorry for any error, English is not my mother tongue. Also sorry for the wall of text.

I started my Master's programme this month and right now I try to get to know as many classmates as I can. It is only a short programme which worried me a bit before; I started my Bachelor's during Covid and barely met people from my course back then. That is why I want to make friends here or at least try my best to have a good social life after having nothing.

I consider myself to be quite open, though I am also shy and I need some time to adjust to new social situations. Next to that I also have to adjust to a new university setting as I am also studying in another country now, though not far away from home. Like, I can drive by car back home in a short time.

Today after class I went to the library with   classmates and I was happy that I took that chance. While talking with them, I realized   things though:

First of all, finances. Even though my studies just started, I already have anxiety regarding money. I am still waiting for a letter regarding student financial aid, but I am not even sure if I receive some. I got a job in a restaurant, but I rather want to work druing vacation so that I can focus on my studies and social life here. Talking to the others, I realized that they are quite rich. They are talking about the internship that they want to do abroad (""oh they are unpaid, well, that doesn't matter""- internship in New York or Paris) and their former universities which I consider very expensive. Someone asked me where I want to go to for an internship (like what country or city) and basically, I had to say that I am too poor to go somewhere abroad. Although they seemed to understand me and not ask me further, they also seemed to be confused. I am grateful for the support I get from home, but there is still the feeling that I miss important opportunities that help me later in my career. And I mean, an internship in New York would be a dream of mine as I seek experience in foreign countries.

Another topic is love. To break it down, I am in my early  s and I haven't had any romantic or sexual experience, plus I am asexual and have no interest in casual dating or ONS. I don't lack sex, but a romantic relationship as I never had one and I kind of feel the pressure from society, if that makes sense. I mean, even my mom asks if I already met a pretty guy. I really try to work on it but it is not easy. Within the same library group today, they talked about the weekends where they get drunk (I don't drink though I am very happy with that so that is not an issue) and have ONS or how they started dating someone etc. For me it sounded like a typical scene from these US College setting movies, if that makes sense. Others are in long-term relationships. Of course I only talked to   people, but it makes me feel like I am quite the outsider with my non-experience-and-being-single. It kind of made me feel bad about myself and hours afterwards, I am still thinking about this. 

I just don't want to compare myself and see myself as a loser but want to have the best social life I can. Maybe someone has been in the same situation (also with other aspects maybe)? I would be grateful to receive some tips about how to deal with this as I also feel like this is the first time I really have to deal with this in social interactions (thanks Covid).",3451,661,0

I feel very ashamed of that being something that’s important to me as in life sometimes you just have to do what you don’t want to do, and tech is the way of the future so I might as well get on board.

 I pushed through for a few semesters feeling dumb and like I would be a terrible computer scientist. I have also been dealing with some mental health issues while dealing with the stress of my major and recently came to the conclusion that I should just give up on it.


I was hoping I would grow to like the major more but haven’t and don’t think it’s worth the risk to keep continuing. Having W’s on my transcript scares me so much, but I don’t think I should continue the semester.

I have no clue what I’d change my major to as everything I like is more humanities(i.e. History) and is either underpaid, overworked, or disrespected. 

How did you all choose your major in this climate where it feels like some majors are just not important?(no offense to anyone in these majors)

Do you all have any tips on what I should do as next steps? If you have struggled with moving from a stem major to something else please share your story.

1707841391.0,college,"My only college ""friends"" hate me and I don't know whyQuick background: I have always been a loner. Never had any close friends. I've been bullied my whole childhood and I believed that I will finally make some friends in uni.

I thought I made two friends. Last year was great with them. They called me to spend time on their room time-to time. They never invited me to hang out though but I didn't mind that. For clarification, those two girls are roommates. I live in another room.

But I've noticed drastic shift last semester. They became very close to each other and started ignoring me. We never really messaged each other outside the school like regular friends do so I never heard form either of them on weekends or during the holidays. I tried to initiate conversations through messenger but it always ended with short answers and I stopped trying pursuing the conversations outside of the uni.

But this semester it got extremely weird. One of the girls started ignoring me in person, barely talking to me. I always had to ask her questions, I felt like I was forcing her to talk. She talked to others just fine.

I took a week off when I was feeling sick. Another classmate of mine sent me some study materials and this girl who ignores me apparently told her not to send me anything.

When I found this out, I felt betrayed and sad. The worst thing is that I've been feeling depressed last few weeks and this information just worsened my state. To clarify, I didn't tell them I am depressed. I didn't bother them with that and I tried to look happy so that couldn't be the reason for this.

I don't know what to do. I am alone again. I am in the second year and everyone has their own friend groups. I feel so lonely. I just wish she told me what I did wrong so I would know I could prevent my mistakes in the future.

I have a theory she envies my grades. I am not the best student, but I remember her bringing up that I didn't deserve to get A from histology since I didn't study all of the questions (I skipped topic or two and I got lucky during the final exam). But I don't think this would be the reason to completely ignore me.

Hello. To introduce myself a bit: I am an  th grade high school student currently lost about which major to pursue. I dreamed of being Architect but now I’m not sure.

Obviously, I would like to major in Architecture but I know the market is quite saturated and despite having a passion for it - I want to live a higher middle class life. I know money isn’t everything, but it helps a lot. So, I looked into Civil Engineering which isn’t the same but it has a lot of relations to Architecture.

I’m less knowledgeable in this area so much information is appreciated.

And what are my goals for a career? Just something I wouldn’t hate doing (such as IT or Law) , pays well and contributes to society. Bonus points if it can help the environment.

For a little background info, I am currently active duty in the Navy working as an FCA (SPY Tech so managing repairs, daily operation and educating the crew on the equipment.) I ADORED my job, the Radar was my comfort zone from initial schooling all the way through complicated repair jobs. When I separate in the next few months, I am locked in to full time work due to commitments (mainly my daughter with extensive medical needs and existing bills) but I have my mind set on also attending college since I have the veteran suite of tuition assistance. My biggest hurdle so far has been actually deciding on a degree. I am absolutely lost when it comes to deciding on what to study and my mind is telling me to stick to what I know and supplement my work experience but I'm honestly not too sure what that would look like, in terms of majors.

This might violate rule   for being “generic” or “easily google-able” but stuff I’ve found online doesn’t really answer my questions. Everything says to go to clubs and to talk to the people next to you in class and stuff like that but I don’t know *how* to talk to people.

When people suggest just sitting next to someone and introducing yourself I feel like everyone but me has some innate ability to talk to people they don’t know at all with full confidence.

I’ve joined a couple clubs and have even started to make friends with an a cappella group I joined, but I can’t seem to make friends with anyone in it to the point where we would hang out outside of club meetings, they’re really fun in the club but outside no one invited me to anything and as the new member I feel super awkward being the one to invite to anything, let alone the fact that I have nothing to invite them *to*.

So really my question I guess is just how do you talk to people in your classes to the point of hanging out outside of them? Right now I mainly just want people I can comfortably invite to lunch or something similar.

I feel awfully invasive if people around me are already having a conversation and I join them, and I can’t even strike a conversation with the person next time if I wanted to, since basically everyone sits with at least one seat between them and the person next to them.

However, I'm in an online class where the professor has not responded to any emails pertaining to my accommodations a month into the semester. Our first exam is due this Friday, and he hasn't added the time, nor has he filled out the Alternative Testing Agreement that all my other profs have.

The Disability Resource Center (DRC) basically said they'll try to email him but if he doesn't respond there's nothing they can really do. His office hours don't happen until the day the test is due, and the DRC closes early that day, so even if he filled it out right then they wouldn't have time to process it. I'm at a loss for what to do. I've never had a prof be so uncommunicative, and this whole situation has made me feel so unwelcome as someone disabled in college.

1707772925.0,college,"My professor has said things that are personally offensive, but my current situation has me scared to do something. What should I do?For context, I’m in my last semester of community college, taking my last required course before I can transfer to the university I want to go to. I already submitted my transfer application, so that university will treat this in-progress course as though I have passed it when deciding who is accepted and who is not. The college I go to is more or less a feeder school, so getting in should not be a problem unless I mess up.

The current course professor, however, has said and done things that have, for lack of a better phrase, pissed me off. Course-wise, she will leave chunks of the lessons to instructional videos instead of teaching the class itself. They give labs that have instructions that aren’t very clear, and it’s compounded by how these labs require using a software they have no interest in properly teaching us how to use. Some of the time, instead of properly correcting students of their mistakes, they’ll harshly tell us “No, redo that, you clearly didn’t follow instructions”. Their tests are arguably longer than what can usually be done within the class period window (an hour and fifteen minutes). It doesn’t really help how they make up over  % of our grade, with the next highest percent value being  % on the final exam. But this isn’t the main issue.

When it comes to personality, they have said things that are completely unbecoming of the job and title they have. For added context, I’m taking this class with my brother. My brother is in the same situation as me (last semester, transferring, application done). We’re twins, and we both have ADHD and anxiety, but he is in a far worse state when it comes to both. He isn’t the best at math, and he does not think he’s smart at all (this is at the fault of several teachers throughout his time in school who basically told him to his face he was stupid). This is not the case. I’ve seen him get straight A’s. 

Nonetheless, when you combine those previously mentioned factors, he’s just going to be one of those students who needs to and will ask for help when he’s confused (or frozen up due to the pace some classes can go). This teacher, in the first week of class, insulted his intelligence and how he was the only one who didn’t understand what was going on since my brother was confused with the directions they were giving on how to find all those specific buttons on the TI-  calculator we’re required to use. He has never used one before in his life, and the professor was mad at him for this. One time, after class, they asked him if he was seeing a psychiatrist/therapist for his issues, and of course my brother felt pressured to answer. That is, obviously, a complete disregard for and breach of privacy.

As for me, this past week they made a statement on telling the difference between me and my brother, since we do look alike. She, in front of the *entire* class, referred to me as being the “heavier” one of the two. Me and my brother are ~ ’ , but I’m ~  pounds and my brother is ~ . Weight is something I am severely self-conscious about, and I weigh   lbs. less than I did a year ago. However, effectively being called fat in front of my classmates still hurts. The statement hurt enough that I almost started stress eating as soon as I got home.

I want to tell the department chair or whatever proper academic authority immediately about the things this professor has said. But I’m scared that it will just make things worse. I’ve dealt with our college’s bureaucracy with some redtape paperwork issue before, and it didn’t go well. If I tell somebody now and it doesn’t work and the professor finds out, I’m worried they’ll take that out on my grade. If it does work and they do something, this professor might try to pin it on the idea of me being angry that my brother is struggling (he isn’t at a passing grade at the moment). While the action of screwing a student’s grade for solely personal reasons is both rare and outlandish, I’m not giving this professor the benefit of doubt.

On the *other* hand, if I wait until the end of the semester and classes are done, the same two possibilities still linger: if I wait, they could brush it off solely because the semester is done and in the rear view mirror. The chance of my brother not passing is also there, so even if they *do* look into it at the end, this professor could say it was out of some vengeance for failing my brother and preventing him from transferring.

It’s freaking me out, but I’d like to tell someone now while other students’ memories of what the professor said is still fresh to use as evidence, I cannot let this become a “he said, she said” case. Also, if I wait, my brother’s success is even *less* likely because he simply does worse when he has bad teachers or professors. Should I deal this now, or let it be?

I’m sorry if this post violates the discussing college admissions rule with the whole context of transferring, but it contextualizes my fear of doing something about all of this.

I'm currently a third-year student majoring in EECS (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) at IISER (Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research) in India. I study in a research-based college, and lately, I've been feeling quite lost about my career path.

Here's a bit of background: I recently completed an internship in December where I worked on core electronics device modeling. While the experience was valuable, I found the work challenging, and I'm not sure about the job opportunities and growth prospects in this field. Additionally, I'm uncertain about the financial aspects of pursuing research, such as funding for a PhD. I've heard mixed opinions about job availability in academia, which has added to my confusion.

Considering these uncertainties, I've been contemplating switching my focus to cybersecurity or computer science. I believe these fields offer opportunities both in industry and research, providing a potentially more stable career path.

However, I'm at a crossroads and would greatly appreciate some advice or guidance. Here are a few specific questions I have:

 . How do I assess whether I'm on the right track with my current specialization in EECS, or if I should pivot towards cybersecurity/CS?
 . What are the job prospects and growth opportunities like in the fields of electronics device modeling versus cybersecurity/CS?
 . How do funding and financial support work for research programs like a PhD? Is it feasible to pursue a PhD without worrying too much about financial constraints?
 . Considering my interest in pursuing a master's degree, what would be the best approach: a) Doing my master's at my current college b) Writing the GATE exam and attending IITs for my master's c) Gaining work experience for a few years before pursuing a master's d) Pursuing a master's degree abroad

EDIT: I do want to add on that my illness is sometimes super severe that I need to ask my parents to pick me up from school in the middle of the school day so that I can go home to sleep. Sometimes it’s hard for me to focus/memorize. Sometimes I’m fine, I can run  -  miles easily and focus really good. 
Berkeley is about  -  hours where I live so it’d be hard for me to travel often to see them and likewise for them. 

Don’t say see a doctor, I have, many of them. There is no permanent solution for this. I just need some advice about this college situation.

EDIT: THANK YOU so much for all your suggestions/opinions/advices! I have a much clearer picture on what I should do and how I should handle the situations going forward. I appreciate you all so much! ",2002,375,0

Or is it even possible?To start with, I'm sorry in advance if this question may not entirely fit this sub's theme. so As the title says, I am currently in a dilemma. I am a Junior in high school that is aspiring to apply to Film School and build a filmmaking career. Problem is, since I was really little I've had a burning passion for music but then dropped it, not being able to practice an instrument ever again due to personal socioeconomic circumstances. I've recently rediscover this passion for it but now,   years later, I'm an absolute beginner with barely any knowledge on how to play an instrument or music theory, therefore pursuing music alone may not be the best decision when I have less than a year to apply to college. My other flaming passion is film and it has been my top one option when thinking about my future.

1707678903.0,college,"Should I stay full time/go part time/ or drop out?Back story: I am a junior in college with around   credit hours (Business Degree). I am very fortunate in that I have not had to pay out of pocket for any of my schooling due to tuition assistance I receive and scholarships. I have a relative that works at the school and I received scholarships due to my good grades in high school and my ACT score. That being said, after my first semester of college I knew this was something that I did not want to do, but I have continued anyway because I believed it would be stupid to turn down free school.

Side story: I am currently a pilot and flight instructor. I started working at the airport my senior year of high school, and not long after I started flight lessons. During my freshman year of college I continued to work at the airport and pursue my instrument rating. I took my instrument checkride with an examiner who happen to own a specialty flight school, and after passing, he offered me a job working in his hangar. I took him up on this offer and started working for him my sophomore year of college and throughout this time I continued to work on my ratings. In about about a year of working for him, I was able get an additional   ratings, including my flight instructor certificate, which gave me a promotion from hangar boy to flight instructor. During this time I didn't have much of a life as all I did was work, fly, and go to school, but I am forever thankful for how this opportunity accelerated my career. At of the begging of this year I have also taken on a more managerial role at the school in addition to my normal instructing.

Present day: Now I am in a position where I have the opportunity to fly and build hours and gain experience in actual aviation management, but I feel that I am having to turn down opportunities and focus my time at completing my school work instead of flying or working . I feel like I am slowing down or hindering my career by being in school, which has made me build up a massive amount of resentment and anger, making it difficult for me mentally to complete my school work. In addition to this, from my experience, at least at my university, I feel that the saying ""If you cant do it, teach it"" definitely applies as I have learned  x more through working than in my classes.

I am a  M and the girl I was seeing was a  F, junior in college. I graduated   years ago and live in a big city ~ hr and   mins away from her. 

We were really good and really happy for   months. I always made an effort to go to her, or her to come to me (its just an hour and a half train I’d pay for her everytime)

But recently she kind of pulled away and I am really upset.

 I honestly think she sort of realized that even though she liked me, she didn’t wanna be tied down to some dude   years older living in a completely different state (I am from her town though in said state, she went to a college in our state) while shes still young in college suppose to be free and having fun. Her exact words and it was devastating to hear but she said she doesn’t wanna be at frat parties and out at school and “Have any chance of potentially hurting me” Sucks a lot for me but I understand where shes coming from I guess. 

She says I am her “ideal husband”, wants to travel the world together,  and sees us getting married just she can’t be super serious and commit right now. Honestly I sort of reacted poorly and just said we shouldn’t  talk again in the future and let this book and chapter close. In my eyes I see it as I don’t wanna be strung along and she can get with other people and when shes ready and bored just come back to me like I’m a sad puppy waiting, like I am just some option she can have whenever.

1707662256.0,college,"Why so much gatekeeping?I do not understand the logic behind why a bachelors degree should take so long.   years? Are you serious? Why not be just done with it in   years? 

Im   and have emailed over   universities in Canada if they could let me complete the degree faster by overloading the number of courses per semester, but the maximum overload they allow is just   course per semester and that too after going through a shit load of bureaucracy. 

The main frustration is that is nobody seems to even notice this , let alone have a problem with it. Not a single student. They are just ready to waste their (  years — Duration according to their potential) of time. Same is for high school, how can that not be reduced by  -  years for people who are ambitious enough? Instead of promoting people to be ambitious, the ambitious are gate-kept.  

I am ready to afford college while working minimum wage for   years, but not   years. 

If gas prices increase by   cents, it’s questioned like hell, becomes a national news, but a place where so many years are just getting wasted into inefficiency, the monetary -but not the only- value of which is hundreds of thousands of dollars itself, is not even being noticed.  I just cannot wrap my head around that to come to an understanding as to how that is even possible. 

More incidents: 

> So apparently, it takes   years to learn literally every field of study from engineering to english. Wow what a coincidence. 


>Colleges want a  -year degree for masters,  -year not valid. Ok, understandable, why not just ask the individuals with  -year degrees to take some extra courses to make them ready for the master’s program?


>The last university I contacted would accept a   year non CS degree with   courses related to CS but not about   year CS degree with   courses related to CS. Wow, how logical. 


>There are some masters programs in US or maybe even Canada which do not require the bachelors in the same field but still make it compulsory. If bachelors is not related anyways, then how is it different from having no bachelors at all? To make them competent for the master’s program, they make them take   foundational courses. If   courses is all that it takes to get ready, then why require a bachelors at all?

>Bachelors required for med school. Now that one is actually very logical as it wants doctors to serve   less years in the service, isn’t it? Oh, merit? Is a bachelors the only way to test merit? Can it just not be dependent on an exam +  interview? 

>Bachelors required to be elligible for CPA exams, if you are going to test the skills anyways through the exams, then why require bachelors at all? 

If there is a   year old who wants to go to med school, why is there no pathway for him to prove his passion and merit for it. Oh, would the   year old not be competent enough to handle the load? Well, then he won’t pass the exam and interview anyways. That’s for merit to decide, not you. 

Again, the main problem/frustration is not what’s mentioned above but that nobody even seems to even notice this illogical gatekeeping.

These are the things I cannot wrap my head around and request them to be explained to me as to how frustrating this all is.

EDIT: Now a thing that would actually be practical is to allow people to view prerecorded lectures online and then give exam to prove competency. Okay okay, now before you go on, I know education is much more than just gaining knowledge, it’s about being provided with feedback and supervision on each and every step. It’s about teaching how to approach a problem and not just give a formula. It is about teaching how to think, perform analysis, and then supervising at each and every step as to how to approach it. But that doesn’t happen in the universities anyways. It’s more lecture driven rather than discussion nor it is much in depth. So if there isn’t any of that anyways, why not just let people view lectures online and give exams? And the score on those exams could be used to let people get enrolled for pre-doc because thats a thing that cannot be done by prerecorded lectures anyways. Then pre-doc for PHD. ",4154,735,0

Now I’m taking prerequisite courses at a community college online for physical therapy school and it’s like night and day difference. It feels like a lot of the assignments are just busy work and cheating is so ridiculously easy if you want to. 

Is it just that everyone is cheating and no matter what teachers assign students are able to bull crap their way through it and this inflates their sense of what’s their students can handle work load wise? Which means they just keep assigning LOADS more work than they would have   years ago?

1707601933.0,college,"Nursing or Business Analytics?Hi, I want to give some background information prior to getting into this situation I’m currently in. I’m a freshman in college. I was initially at university doing Biology Pre-Pharmacy, I’m now in my second semester at a community college as undecided. Huge shift. I know. 

When I was at university, I was working around  -  hours a week. Most days I would go to school from  :  AM -  :  PM because I would be studying for an upcoming exam or quiz. I didn’t have a life. I was tired and frustrated all the time. I ended up with straight A’s but I was also sleep deprived, practically failing the first two months, and beyond stressed. I worked my ass off for those A’s. Ultimately, I decided I didn’t like how I was feeling and switched out of the school completely to save money until I finalized a decision on what to do with my life. 

Fast forward to today, I’m a liberal arts major (Undecided), I’m currently in between Business Analytics, initially thought of pursuing this major but am genuinely terrified of the results. All I’ve ever heard was business was insecure and there’s always difficulties establishing yourself and getting a job after. So that’s really demotivating, and I’m not sure if I want to dedicate time to a useless degree. My second option was going back into the health field. But this time instead of a Biology degree and then later pursing a graduate education. I was thinking of nursing. I know nothing about nursing. I have a couple nurses in the family. All I know is that the schooling is incredibly stressful as well and that I’ll basically be back at square one studying all day with no real life to live. 

I want to point out a couple of side notes. I’m incredibly terrified of failure. If I pursue nursing, I know it’s very easy to get kicked out of the program if you even fail one course. At least in a ASN program. I’m not really sure how the BSN works. The only positive side I could see from nursing is the job security once the schooling is over. 

I also want to note that I’ve taken dozens of career tests and they’ve all said management careers. The only problem is again. There’s no job security in business. I’ve taken a personality test as well if that helps, my result was ESFP-T personality. 

Ultimately, I’m lost. I have till late March to officially decide on a major according to the school. Does anyone have advice? Please let me know. And thank you.",2440,441,0
1707600623.0,college,"Is it better to drop out of animation school? 

Hello! I'm an artist studying animation, I'm   years old, and I've started to consider dropping out of university.

I feel like I'm progressing very slowly, that learning online has helped me much more than university, and of course, I feel that the best way to get a job is through contacts rather than a university degree. Additionally, the economy at home is very difficult. I've thought about starting an online business and continuing to work on my artistic career (in fact, currently, my main income comes from art commissions). I've thought about creating multiple income streams such as investments, e-commerce, dropshipping, and merchandising for my brand, among other things.

But university not only consumes my time, I feel like I'm not learning anything valuable, and it's only holding me back from progressing in what I want to do. The only thing that interests me is the opportunity to go to Canada for their programs.

The problem with university is that it's an additional expense, so I need to use time to develop a stable source of income to pay for it. However, dedicating time to that means neglecting university, so it's a never-ending cycle. As they say, 'the more you take on, the less you achieve.'

Honestly, I feel that dropping out of university and taking the path of self-directed learning, networking, and developing my own sources of income sounds more promising.

It's just that nearly every aspect of university is very overwhelming and I'm not sure how to get through itFor some context, I'm autistic, ADHD, OCD, and depression. I am an online student living with my family, and family has been very tense lately. I am going to tutoring and I'm in the process of switching a therapist since the therapist I have now has been pushing boundaries.

Ever since I was a kid, I have always loved learning, but I've struggled with school environments and most classes. The only time I struggled less in college was when I was at a community college even though it was pretty lonely there. I was in the honor society, and the staff were amazing with my accommodations.

Now I'm a senior at university, and everything feels so much harder. I have had little support at the university I go to with my accommodations, and even through I'm taking   classes and I'm very passionate about my degree, I'm failing all of them.

There are a couple of things that happened to me recently that are very difficult to go through. The first being that I ended an unhealthy relationship (that's a very long story) and then one of my siblings that I'm very close to and is very supportive of me is moving really far for a job. 

Usually, I'm able to have some motivation for college, but this time I feel so defeated at the moment. My body is physically exhausted it feels like I haven't slept in days even though I sleep well, and I just feel very trapped. 

I would drop my classes and focus on my mental health. The problem is that all of my classes are declaration classes, and I believe that I can only drop so many classes, so this would most likely put me in an even worse place in the long run.

I have a few questions, and it's perfectly okay if someone answers one or all of them.

When things are really bad, how do you stay motivated? 

Also, if you're neurodivergent, what were the accommodations that helped you the most? Or were there any accomodations that you didn't know about that helped you tremendously?",2057,374,0

I have to try hard to participate in class and in doing so I realize yesterday during a lab that I’m the obnoxious student in the class, unintentionally. I study hard and desperately try to be a straight A student. When my professor asked a question yesterday to the class I blurted out the answer just as she asked another student to answer. I think I do this often.  Now I think I’m a “know it all” that dominates the class. Should I ask my professor if I’m being out of line? Or just continue as is, or try to dial myself back?

1707517283.0,college,"Studying for a physics exam which I know I'll fail.First off, in my country, we have   main types of high schools, vocational which focus on something specific like basics of engineering or electrotechnical engineering and general high schools which serve as a preparation for college.

I started college this year ( / ). Went from a ?vocational? high school (Don't know the exact translation) focused on basics of engineering. I've decided to go to college, also engineering and I knew that my first year would be hell in terms of physics and maths.

I had no classes of general physics for the whole time I studied in high school, so none of the basics stuck with me. I don't know the basic equations and don't have any of the basic thinking about physics problems. On top of that basic things like derivations, integrals or imaginary units are generally not taught on vocational high schools... (I really don't understand this)

Now there is a physics exam waiting for me next Tuesday, I just finished all of the materials which were given to us (presentations) and started fully practicing the equations (exam has two parts, written test and a oral part).

I don't know anything. It seems as if the equations just create themselves out of nothing. I can remember some of the theory, but no enough to apply it. I'm just lost and don't know what to do.

Every day I get this feeling of dread, because I know that I'm doomed to failure and can't do anything about it. (And hate myslef for this)",1495,264,0

Basically in a week I’m flying to visit my bf at his college for a few days, he goes to a smaller religious school but there are no rules on having a significant other stay the night so he said I can stay in his dorm with him. I’m   female and he’s   male with an   male roommate I’ve never met before, I’m not sure if this is going to be awkward? He said I can shower and everything in the girls bathroom in hall but I’m a little nervous it’s going to be weird since it’s such a small school/building that everyone knows just about everyone so I’ll just be a random roaming the hall. I don’t know anyone or any other girls at his school at all so I just feel a little nervous I’m gonna just be all on my own for certain things obviously.

1707512429.0,college,"Course Withdrawal what does it impact?Hey all I'm new to college and have some circumstances I'm trying to work through.

I'm full time doing   credits at a community college with plans to move to an instate university in the fall. I'm also doing another   credits at the university I want to attend. The class is an entry level class for electrical engineering.

Now to the problem, I'm   weeks in and this class has been awful. There's very minimal support for online students and the programs/concepts feel impossible to work with. Im sinking more time trying to get this   credit class than i am in my   credit physics class. I dont feel like im going to pass this class, moreover, I no longer feel like electrical is a good fit for me. This class has single handedly made me want to switch to a different branch of engineering. 
I want to withdraw. However, since it's the only class I'm taking at the university withdrawing means doing a semester withdrawal not just a class withdrawal. I'd still be doing   credits at the community college though. Worst of all, since I've decided to pursue a different branch of engineering, this class doesn't even count for my degree. Not even as an elective. So it's hard to justify spending the ridiculous amount of time this class is requiring when it essentially does nothing for me.

My main question is how bad would something like this affect financial aid and scholarships? Does having a semester withdrawal leave a terrible mark on my records? Outside of this issue I'm a  .  GPA student. 

Any advice or experiences with this is very much appreciated. Thank you.",1615,279,0
1707510398.0,college,"Suitemate leaves bathroom disgustingly messyMe and my roommate share a bathroom with another girl living in a single dorm. A week ago she clogged our bathroom drain and left   inches of water sitting in the bottom of the tub along with tons of shaved hair and other debris. I called a plumber and scrubbed the bathtub without saying a word, because I assumed she didn’t realize that the tub hadn’t drained, and was trying to be a good person. Today I opened the toilet to find it un-flushed, with blood and a loose tampon applicator floating inside. (For the male audience, those go in the trash can). I am going to leave the toilet untouched until she deals with it herself, but how do I prevent these things from happening in the future? 

To add to my frustration, me and my roommate have bought toilet paper for the bathroom since the beginning of the year, and it’s the only thing not supplied by the dorm building.
